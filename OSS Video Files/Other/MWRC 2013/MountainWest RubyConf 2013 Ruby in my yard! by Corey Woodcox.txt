Title: MountainWest RubyConf 2013 Ruby in my yard! by Corey Woodcox
Publication date: 2020-01-28

Description: 
	Look, I know you love your sprinkler timer, with its endearing little dials and simple, easy-to-use interface, and its killer dot-matrix LCD.
We thought we could do better, and we thought Ruby could help us. With the awesomeness of things like the Raspberry Pi and maybe a little Arduino, who's to say I can't use Ruby to water my lawn, remind me to fertilize, or let me know where I could save a little water?
We'll take you on a quick tour of the automated sprinkler system world and the problems it has, and how we're solving them with Ruby, Raspberry Pi, and about 24V of DC power. We promise not to electrocute you, but we can't guarantee you won't get a little bit wet.

my name is Corey Woodcock's I work for

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,160
the OC Tanner company um we have a lot

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,589
of us here today it's awesome I like it

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,510
a lot we do Ruby on Rails we have

00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,980
automated testing and we loved one

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,140
hundred percent code coverage because

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,089
that is a metric that will surely ensure

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:45,269
that you have no bugs in your code we we

00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:49,170
use angular wees Roku we get hub pull

00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:50,219
requests and issues we last time I

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,259
checked out of poise we were averaging

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,269
about eight to ten a day continues

00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,220
deployments thanks to circle see I have

00:00:54,269 --> 00:01:01,350
a nice chat with him last night dinner

00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:05,820
um and yeah we're totally awesome so and

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,869
we are hiring as per the usual so before

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,130
I get started I want you all to know

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,920
that I have zero experience in

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,400
electronics engineering I don't have any

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,299
idea what any of this does to give you

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,500
an idea of this about 20 minutes ago I

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,290
don't know if you can smell it in the

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,010
air still but there's a distinct scent

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,680
of an exploded capacitor that was me um

00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,990
blow up a capacitor back there drove to

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,690
radioshack about her new one of these

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,520
got here back in time so if you have if

00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:40,290
you've ever heard the expression doing

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,290
it live that's what this is basically I

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,740
have no idea what I'm doing so why did I

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,010
do this um well home automation is

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,430
really really cool if you think about

00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,619
the electronics that you use every day

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,330
the the thing that you probably use the

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,150
most I don't have any statistics I'm

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,530
just talking out of my ear is probably

00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,090
one of the simplest devices ever

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,210
invented it's called the light switch

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,539
and it has two contacts and it's either

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,009
on or off and you can replicate that

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,819
with this little guy right here it's

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:18,739
called a solid state relay it's I mean

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:21,360
it's super simple so I wanted to do

00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:25,049
something with home automation so that I

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,150
could do there was a can't remember who

00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:29,249
said it last night at dinner but that he

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,450
said that it's the year 2013 and I still

00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,390
have to go through my house and turn off

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,130
all the lights before I

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:37,180
why has the future left behind my house

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,400
so I want to have a little fun and

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,400
setting this up and it's super easy I

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,319
mean I have no idea what I'm doing and I

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:50,470
pulled this off I think it's very useful

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,550
and it's been I've always wanted to

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,350
spend a fortune on a home automation

00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,850
system there is a disney channel

00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,170
original movie when I was a kid it's

00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,110
called smart house had this holographic

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,100
lady that was like they're made and I

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,110
just thought that was a coolest thing

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,489
ever I mean how cool that be to have

00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,959
your smart lence your smart house make

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,180
you breakfast in the morning and stuff

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,500
like that so it's it's my secret love

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,060
but really when he comes down to

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,450
automation is really what I'm all about

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:17,590
because it's not even a secret because I

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:19,090
am extraordinarily lazy and I don't like

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,680
to do things over and over I had a

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,940
t-shirt in high school and it said go

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,760
away before I replace you with a very

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,769
small shell script I don't know if

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,600
you've seen that on thinkgeek but it's a

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,010
good one so I like it when things are

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,200
very easy to use I like it when things

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:36,130
are simple I like it when things are

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:40,090
fast and that's why I use Ruby um I like

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,760
it when things get out of my way so a

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,180
great example of that is nest nest is

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,450
freaking cool I mean it's easy to use

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,850
it's very very simple it's fast there's

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,200
this cool thing it learns about how your

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,329
house works and how you like your house

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,380
to your the temperature in your house to

00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:02,410
be it's a thermostat and it's awesome

00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,060
because they say that the nest moment is

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,989
when you walk up to it to change it and

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,310
say you know it's a little chilly in

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,680
here I wanted a little warmer and then

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,930
it does it for you and that's really

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,090
cool I think that automation like that

00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,769
has a huge place in our lives and that

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,299
we should we should try to make home

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,090
stuff like that and it stays out of the

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:20,350
way it doesn't it doesn't try to do too

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,750
much it does one thing and it does it

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:26,200
really really really well then there's

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,490
this that is in my garage I don't know

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:33,010
if you can you probably can't read it

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,900
but right here it says date code 893 so

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,270
that was built almost exactly 20 years

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,570
ago and it runs the sprinklers in my

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,930
yard it's clunky literally when you turn

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,759
that knob it makes a giant clunk sound

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,030
it's probably the scariest thing I've

00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,320
ever seen it's super annoying every time

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,520
the power goes out it forgets what time

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,370
it is and then my sprinklers come on in

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,330
the middle of the day it's super slow I

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,550
don't know if you've ever programmed

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,080
anything like that but you to reset the

00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,370
time when it forgets what time it is you

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,880
hold the plus button down for about two

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,970
years and then eventually you get to the

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,030
right time and it's old just like I said

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,970
almost 20 years old so things have

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,910
gotten better in this realm correct not

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,190
exactly that's for sale right now home

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,139
depot the the modern version of my timer

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,560
I took this photo Home Depot this

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,990
morning I mean it's not getting any

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,250
better they they still have knobs and

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,030
everything so if rails is omakase I

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,949
don't want to know what this is um so

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,690
how do i set this thing up what do i how

00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,300
do I do this what does this thing even

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,039
do it's really easy all you need to do

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,860
is watch the 10-minute instructional DVD

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,330
that came with your system some of these

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,970
are available online and if you want a

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,010
good laugh go watch them they are

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,220
awesome they teach you all about how

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:53,070
easy it is to do these things in its

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,479
their each 20 minutes long and I don't

00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,150
know if you've noticed but I really

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,580
really hate this I hate the way that

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,030
this works I hate how I have to use this

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,270
and so this winter after i forgot to

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:08,789
winterize my sprinklers I decided that I

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,800
was gonna I was going to build something

00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:13,979
to manage them for me so that I didn't

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,539
have to do reset the clock all the time

00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,949
and I didn't have to sit there and

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,210
fiddle with it and I could set it I

00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,710
could set stations to run more than

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,800
three times in a day and things like

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,789
that because I mean there's better ways

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,500
to do this so the first thing I noticed

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,909
is that reasonable defaults will suit

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,409
most people that's kind of a thing with

00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:35,759
rails you don't need to I mean it's so

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,630
easy to figure out what time it is

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,880
there's some things that I shouldn't

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,050
have to do with a network connection I

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,659
can get the time of day like that

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,539
there's like 18 thousand different ntp

00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:48,479
servers in the world and the device

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,460
location where I am so I can figure out

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,440
if I have any restrictions on what times

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,000
like I'm water totally easy to get with

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,169
a network connection even better with a

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,680
smartphone

00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:00,029
and current whether it's snap with a

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,379
network connection none of these things

00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:05,099
are connected to the internet and I

00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:09,270
don't know why and simply this thing

00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:10,889
right here it's a 24 volt solenoid it's

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,419
a little plunger that sits inside there

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:16,199
and there's an electromagnet at the top

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:18,719
and it sucks the plunger up and allows

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,939
water to leak inside inside the housing

00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:23,219
which causes the water pressure to

00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:26,099
actually push the valve open so I mean

00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:28,860
there's it's dead simple there's nothing

00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,909
to break about it like I said might have

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,979
been installed for 20 years they still

00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:35,129
work great and they still work exactly

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,659
like this brand new one so let's just go

00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:41,189
wire up in Arduino and we'll fix it

00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:43,680
right up I don't want to do that Arduino

00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:45,270
is all see stuff I know that you can

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,490
write Ruby and compile it down to the

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,930
Arduino a lot environment and things

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,659
like that but I don't want to do that

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,169
see isn't fun and well I guess it kind

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:57,569
of could be but Ruby's more fun and

00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:00,240
frankly it could be a lot easier if we

00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,349
had linux we get a lot of things for

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,990
free with linux it could be a lot easier

00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:07,649
with ruby and that's why i decided to do

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:10,949
it with a raspberry pi there's a lot of

00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:14,310
advantages to using a raspberry pi it's

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,719
a little bit overpowered for this i mean

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,210
i don't know if you can see it up here

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:19,460
but it's got like an hdmi port and stuff

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,870
like that

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:26,180
I don't need that but it does have the

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,970
ability to drive a really awesome 362 by

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,560
like 160 display that you can just mount

00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,979
right over the top of it and that would

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,050
be awesome but I've done that yet I

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:39,500
don't know what I'm doing um so you get

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,360
networking for free you you mean you

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,830
have a cat5 poor right here an Ethernet

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,350
port you don't have to snap anything on

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:51,500
top of it it's a UNIX system and we all

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:54,050
know that um we get you bun to we get

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,779
native Ruby we get ntp so it

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,510
automatically knows what time it is I

00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:01,880
mean there you go we get UNIX sockets

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,290
and we get everything we love from linux

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,230
and all it costs us is about a

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,420
six-second boot up I think that's

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:12,560
awesome for embedded systems this little

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,490
guy is so fast it it blows my mind all

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,170
the cool things you can do with it

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,170
except when you're compiling Ruby that

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,730
takes like two hours but I'm working on

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,830
that I'm working on that I have a build

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,709
system at home that's almost ready um so

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:29,060
Austin Vance he works for pivotal he was

00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:31,880
talking about arduino at Ruby comp in

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,450
October it's a great top should look it

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,790
up it Arduino is great for small

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:40,220
repetitive tasks because you burn the

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,829
chip and it does the same thing over and

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,779
over and over once it's plugged in and

00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:47,990
that's all it does same thing over and

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,700
over it's perfect for sensors perfect

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,440
for things like that it's great for

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,810
regulating and normalizing your inputs

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,850
and outputs so if you send if you turn

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,640
on two or three pins on your Raspberry

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,410
Pi it can react to it and do certain

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,720
things with all of its wealth of pins

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,579
because Raspberry Pi has by eight gpio

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,670
pins and Arduino is can get like

00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:09,170
hundreds upon hundreds it's great it's

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,079
great for responding to an output with

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:15,290
from a computer so ninety percent of the

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,200
projects I've seen on the internet for a

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,450
raspberry for a Arduino require you to

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,620
have a laptop hooked up to it to control

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:27,410
what it does and that's dorky I don't

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,240
want to tie my laptop down to this it's

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,640
very very limited when it's isolated

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,560
that was the point that that Austin was

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,790
making

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,800
it works best when there's a computer

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,470
around but we have this lovely little

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,560
thing called a Raspberry Pi and it's a

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,750
full linux computer boots right up into

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,720
you bone too I mean it does everything

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,880
you could ask for it's great to be

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,000
compliant and can combine this an

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,279
Arduino for that now now that I've told

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,640
you all of that there's this thing that

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,110
Gary Bernhardt retweeted about two days

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,480
ago and I just had to put it in my

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,070
slides and it looks like this says the

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,960
reason we get excited about software and

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:10,520
libraries and such is that we assume

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,260
that they work which is false and do i

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,120
have a working example of a Raspberry Pi

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,650
talking to an Arduino and doing cool

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:21,020
things no I do not I'm sorry that's what

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:24,520
I would like to see in the future do i

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:31,070
have a working example of turning on a

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:34,370
valve with that I do indeed so we're

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,600
gonna do this and so I thought when I

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,850
was setting all this up and I thought

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,190
you know it'd be really cool to blinking

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,690
LED or something with this with this

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,279
raspberry pi that'd be cool to show

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,560
everything off right I thought you know

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,880
actually let's get a real live sprinkler

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,290
valve that will open and close I mean

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,910
that'd be really cool right and then I

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,870
thought you know I mean it's there's

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,550
million dollars and then there's a

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,790
billion dollars let's do sprinkler

00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:06,050
valves with water so we're gonna do

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:12,720
sprinkler valves with water um you got

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:15,850
it what could possibly go wrong right

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,230
this is this is not a terrible idea I

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,230
don't know what you're talking about

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:35,740
move I kinda didn't tell mike i was

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:37,810
gonna do this so uh huh the gift of

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,280
Michael Jackson eating the popcorn in

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,650
the thriller That's Gary Bernhardt

00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,940
watching the live stream right now

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:48,220
that's what was said in the audience

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:49,780
sorry so I have two valves here that are

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:54,610
controlling the output of the hose into

00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:56,170
this valve so but first things first we

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:02,530
got it we got to talk to this raspberry

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:04,330
pi here so let's go over here we're not

00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:12,100
doing it through the Wi-Fi I'm smarter

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:14,560
than that sort of um there's only a

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,610
little bit of water on the table just a

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,480
little bit from my preliminary testing

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:26,580
how can I get ethernet over there now

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:30,960
all right is this gonna be like what

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,960
Gallagher I don't know what that is

00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:42,399
link is up all right let's see if we can

00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:44,709
talk to this guy we'll do it live that's

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,869
what I said famous last words look at

00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:54,339
that it came right up this is great oh

00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:57,609
look at that I do there we go now you

00:13:54,339 --> 00:14:01,089
can see me raspberry pie right there

00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:08,559
let's make a little bigger and T mux

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:14,619
whoo um okay all right so last year pry

00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:16,389
obviously it takes a second and then

00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:18,759
we're gonna so there's a gem out there

00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,679
called gpio and it's supposed to kind of

00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,449
abstract away the changes between the

00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,579
chain the differences in the gpio

00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:27,879
between raspberry pi version 1 and

00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:29,229
version 2 and also can change can handle

00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,749
some things with some arduino nose and

00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:33,819
stuff like that i haven't had a great

00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:37,779
experience with it but it's what we're

00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:39,549
using for today so the interface is

00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,769
really nice though and i'm planning on

00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:51,879
fixing things up with this but so we do

00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:59,279
gpio output pin whoops n equals GPI

00:14:51,879 --> 00:15:05,759
output pin new pin 7 we get a pin cool

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:12,279
all right I'll open the valves let's see

00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:14,489
first one oh that's a good sign I like

00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,489
this

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:29,819
and then the second one okay we have

00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:31,559
water flowing into the bucket and the

00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:32,699
valve is closed they have to has the

00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,809
prime for a second because the water

00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:47,339
pressure is actually what keeps it

00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:58,009
closed so let me drain the pipe cool

00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:58,009
good enough all right pin dot on

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:21,270
pinned on off its off yeah

00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:33,580
how cool is that right freaking awesome

00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:37,060
I love that um this is so easy you guys

00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:40,690
you have no idea how simple this is so

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,970
I've got the parts that I used right

00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,710
here you guys have ever been to I don't

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,230
know how you say it ad a fruit adafruit

00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:49,270
whatever they have awesome stuff they

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,150
have these little wiring harnesses that

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,860
you can build they have this which is

00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,560
invaluable for raspberry pi it's called

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,870
the PI T cobbler and it's this guy right

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:04,180
here and it comes as a printed board a

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:06,250
ribbon cable and a bunch of pin headers

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,930
and you solder it together it's really

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,260
easy as long as you have a good

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:18,190
soldering iron I didn't but I do now you

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:19,720
don't solder go to spark funcom and get

00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,280
their soldering kit it's like 80 bucks

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,810
and it will be the best thing that ever

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,240
happened to your soldering life it this

00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:29,760
is this took me two minutes and I've

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:32,860
never done it before it's so easy that

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,500
this gives you a little pin out that

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,900
shows you exactly which pin is what you

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,420
can't see it but it shows you ground

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,550
three volts number four number 17 number

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,280
22 tells you exactly which one and it

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:49,270
corresponds exactly to what's on the the

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:52,000
GPIO gem for switching the AC power I

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,680
use it's called a solid state relay I

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,800
don't remember what Dave called it

00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,830
there's another name for it optical

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,860
isolator that's what it is there's a

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:08,020
little tiny LED in this package and an

00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:12,640
AC AC variable resistor so this can hold

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:15,280
back up to 500 volts I believe 250 volts

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,670
at 8 amps and you switch it on and off

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,680
with three and a half bolts so it's it's

00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:24,130
the easiest thing in the world this

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,480
literally would take you an hour if you

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,990
followed instructions that i will be

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,330
posting on my website tonight like it's

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,040
super easy and the good news is

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,770
raspberry pi is no longer insanely

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:40,280
backordered so you can get it I think

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:42,710
ship within a week or so um but yeah

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,850
breadboard I'm a novice at breadboard

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,140
that's why I blew up a transformer

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:51,800
earlier I'm not very good at it and

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:58,130
there's me looking up radio shack this

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:59,540
is this is embarrassing so there's where

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,770
i'm going to have the shopping list i

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:06,770
don't have it up yet because i don't

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:13,180
have URLs to all the products yeah you

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:13,180
guys have any questions for me cool well

00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:28,519
he's not gonna kill me you guys he's not

00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,519
