Title: MountainWest RubyConf 2013 Think twice, code once by Bill Chapman
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: MWRC 2013
Description: 
	The basic premise is that we should be spending significantly more time thinking than we do programming and there are wide reaching ramifications to this point. Subtleties in how our non programming coworkers perceive some of us wandering around the office pacing or arguing at the white board are all to be covered as well as discussing the body of research that supports the ideas behind thinking more and working less.

you

00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,170
mmm

00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:26,540
okay so I'm not a cognitive scientist so

00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,170
i'm working in kind of unfamiliar

00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,670
territory here but even if i don't know

00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:35,120
anything about what i'm about to say I

00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:40,160
got to share the stage with ward so I'm

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:43,100
already in good shape the right side of

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,920
my brain helps me make things rhyme the

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,720
left side keeps it all in time what's in

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,270
between helps me learn and perceive

00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,660
believe that I have the answers I need

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,640
ours is a culture of logic and reason

00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,129
but to the ones and zeroes truly have

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,390
meaning does your software have feelings

00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:04,400
stay tuned you may find this revealing

00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,560
work harder they said you can rest when

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,770
you're dead what is the opportunity cost

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,950
of this lack of Mental Floss so many

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,960
questions and no time for thought maybe

00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,760
you should sleep on it let rapid eye

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,370
movements give way to improvements

00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,280
solutions reduced to abstract illusions

00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:25,159
fast asleep and hard at work generate

00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,020
painless solutions so we've chosen our

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,600
tools we've lined our minds with

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,850
patterns of designed muscle memory

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,240
translates brainwaves to square braces

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,939
and a faint blue glow on end users faces

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,119
but blue glows become blue screens and

00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:43,850
sad max bombs and disasters did we fail

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,049
to think or fail to see over we just

00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:51,079
told work faster five times we asked why

00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:53,270
when things went awry why because the

00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,820
computer does what you tell it to why

00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:58,729
because the analysis was done by fools

00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,920
why this solution doesn't follow the

00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,950
rules why well we missed an opportunity

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:08,539
for code reuse why maybe the end user

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:11,870
was just confused relax your mind is

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:14,180
hard at work maintaining focus a puzzle

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,840
piece is placed precisely with you

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:21,020
unaware of its locus but the joke is a

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,150
computer walks into a bar or crashed

00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,030
into the surface of Mars because you

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,720
told it to think twice code once and

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,720
you'll go far

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,630
so am i i'm bill Chapman I'm the

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,120
development lead at a company called

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,800
academic software plus our parent

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,750
company is liaison international we

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,230
write academic software for admissions

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,300
mostly for the Health Professions this

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,640
is my fourth or fifth year at Mountain

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,040
West so but I've never spoken before so

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,510
Mike longtime listener first-time caller

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:09,560
big fan of the show I consider myself a

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,390
professional thinker and currently my

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,340
most important role i think is as a team

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:20,390
mentor as a team lead i spend most of my

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:22,400
days as a co-pilot so who is Janie well

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,500
Janie's at home with my wife watching

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,450
this presentation she appears to run on

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,240
intuition and trust me Janie thinks

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,380
she's an expert in everything and I'm

00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,400
probably going to get a lot of feedback

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:37,550
from her when I get home tomorrow but

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,130
one thing is that experts tend to have a

00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:43,340
hard time resisting the urge to always

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,380
work on intuition in pragmatic thinking

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,150
and learning and the hunt talks a lot

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:51,980
about the Dreyfus model it's a model of

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,320
how individuals acquired skill and it

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,330
lists things it lists the certain levels

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,340
is novice advanced begin our competent

00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,600
proficient and expert what's interesting

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:04,070
about this model is they assert that

00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,550
most people never get beyond the

00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:10,340
advanced beginner state in this model so

00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:15,280
novice advanced beginner competent most

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:17,989
people are sub competent at most things

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,670
if you couple this with the

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,370
dunning-kruger effect that's where

00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,600
people who are inexperienced tend to

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,020
think they're better at something than

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,750
they actually are you get an interesting

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,930
situation consider that for any given

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,060
problem well let's back up a second most

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,740
of the people in this room for most

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,440
things are probably just advanced

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,510
beginners and for any given problem that

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,350
you have not yet solved you're not yet

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,850
an expert

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:48,980
otherwise you already would have solved

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:53,180
it so there's a couple of reasons I

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:55,250
proposed this talk and one is that often

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,590
as a as a founder for many of the

00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,650
projects that i work on someone who's

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,850
written a lot of the original code you

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,560
know I've often thought about many of

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,680
the solutions that I'm delegating today

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,370
and I find that I have a hard time

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,770
delegating when I've got possibly two

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,110
years of thinking already going into the

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,730
problem and now I have to let one of my

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:20,450
other developers kind of catch up to

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,250
this and I noticed that you know this

00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:26,510
may be something that I worked on for an

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:28,040
hour two years ago why do I all of a

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:31,970
sudden have clarity when I haven't

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:35,020
actually thought about it you know I

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,820
also find that I get frustrated when I'm

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,010
when I'm working in a capacity as a

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,450
manager because you know how many of us

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,610
have said Oh that'll take me 15 minutes

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,320
you know and then maybe you delegate

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,360
this role you ask somebody else to get

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,240
some coding done for you and it it takes

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,860
three or four days and you may remember

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,360
when you did it recently and it took you

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,410
five minutes to do it you took you three

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,030
hours to do it but what you're

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,670
neglecting is the fact that you probably

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,640
thought about it for a long time you

00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:04,010
know I have things where I will sit down

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,360
and completely forget about the four

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,690
months I spent thinking about a problem

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,730
and then implement it in two days and oh

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:16,730
yeah it took me two days did it not

00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:18,410
really so who might benefit from this

00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,800
discussion this is the master gaming

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:24,500
race if anybody's familiar with them

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,560
well programmers people other than

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,040
programmers are managers our coworkers I

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,420
think that there's a lot of

00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,210
miscommunication about what we do for a

00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,350
living and how we get things done

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,340
there's also a small group of

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:42,440
programmers that I'd like to call out

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,230
the freshmen so we've probably all

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,360
worked with the freshmen or we've been

00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,730
the freshmen an example from an

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
interview we did recently the code

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,750
worked great and I couldn't figure out

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,210
what was wrong with it and I realized it

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,550
looked like a freshman cs101 proj

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,759
you can just tell when somebody doesn't

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:04,190
think through a problem completely also

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,349
we had a prospective new hire and we

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,270
give this code this Ruby code quiz and

00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:10,190
we give them a test suite but the test

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,680
suite doesn't necessarily have all of

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,090
the questions so it's not as necessarily

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,069
asking all the questions you need to ask

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,210
to get that thing done you know we

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,990
really want to see if they think through

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,849
the problem you know just assuming that

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,979
well we passed all the tests this must

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:26,449
be a good software you know that's the

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,729
kind of thing the freshman might do and

00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,289
here's some code the freshman right

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:33,650
might write and what's interesting about

00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:37,699
this is it's actually code I wrote as a

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:40,130
freshman in the 90s right I had to

00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:42,110
retrieve it from a floppy has anyone in

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,979
here never had to save anything to a

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,449
floppy but what's interesting about this

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:53,919
is it doesn't look like horrible code

00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:56,000
but I have this big block of ASCII art

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,470
well it turned out that the whole

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,460
project looked like that I probably

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:03,740
spent more time writing these ridiculous

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,330
interfaces than I did actually making

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,130
the code work and it was like a bug

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,630
light for my professor like you know pay

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,780
no attention to the code over here but

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,849
look at this I think one of the

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,080
deficiencies that the freshman has they

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:17,389
have not yet really learned to think

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,159
through a problem they don't see what's

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,949
important I clearly didn't know what was

00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:26,000
important they weren't grading me on

00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:30,190
whatever that is another programmer type

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,190
that might benefit here is mrs. Roberts

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,779
mrs. Roberts often patches a problem

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,310
because they think the bigger issue is

00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:42,050
too complex or potentially unsolvable

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,270
this approach tends to create gremlins

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:47,680
in the codebase those gremlins you could

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:50,120
probably call Bobby tables jr. these

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,260
developers look productive to management

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,790
because they're always working and

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,290
they're always solving problems but but

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:59,180
nobody really realizes that they're

00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:03,170
always solving the same problem and

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:06,260
here's some code that that this

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:09,260
individual might write it looks like

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,100
they had some method missing errors and

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:17,300
they just decided to

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:21,199
sweep them under the rug the Bob Ross

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,050
fan I love Bob Ross I used to fashion my

00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:25,610
entire development style after Bob Ross

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,100
you just keep throwing code at the page

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:33,800
and eventually you end up with something

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:35,329
that works no one else really knows what

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,810
they're up to and they just keep

00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:40,430
throwing layers of code at the page and

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:45,050
it's difficult for anybody else to see

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:48,620
the big picture and you know here's some

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:52,060
code that wait did it go oh yeah here's

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,060
some code that Bob Ross might write

00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:57,500
there's all these happy little methods

00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,149
and what's interesting here is it's find

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,240
out it's hard to find an example of this

00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:04,519
style of code because the end result is

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,199
often deceptive it's got some weird bugs

00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,709
in it because of all the layers in this

00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:15,230
case there's some silly stuff going on

00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:17,240
here but but the most telling thing

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,519
would probably be to sit behind them for

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,610
about an hour and then press ctrl or

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,529
command Z and undo all of the changes

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,439
and just watch all the code go back and

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:29,029
forth their deficiency is that they

00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,889
don't spend so much time thinking about

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:36,319
their solution as much as just chasing

00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:37,699
their intuitive vision this guy about

00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:42,110
all the time this developer the

00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:44,240
mercenary there's somehow able to shut

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:48,290
their brain off at 5pm they don't really

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,660
care about well they don't really care

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,089
about what language they're using uh

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,819
whatever pays well really works for them

00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:59,899
and here's some code that the mercenary

00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:03,730
might write you probably can't see that

00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:07,819
but what's interesting is that it's Ruby

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:12,769
sort of yeah thank you it kind of looks

00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:14,509
more like PHP or java um and this is the

00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,730
thing about the mercenary is that they

00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:19,670
care more about doing the job than using

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,339
the right tool or really learning the

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,730
tools they're using the Merse today

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:25,649
might actually list Ruby

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,310
expert on his resume and still write

00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:31,230
code that looks like this and then you

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,209
know finally and this is dangerous

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,040
territory for me as a development

00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:38,630
manager because sometimes I might fall

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,949
into this mode but the pointy-eared boss

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,769
doesn't always understand what you're

00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:46,410
doing if he's like me and he's got lots

00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,790
of experience he might think well why

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,440
can't you get that done faster because

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,579
he's neglecting all the thinking that

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,660
went into it when he did it the first

00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:56,790
time pointy-eared boss also thinks he

00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,019
knows what working looks like and and

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,630
we're going to talk a little more about

00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,930
what working looks like he also wants to

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:11,870
quantify what you what you do let's see

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:11,870
the last code pointy-eared boss road so

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,630
their deficiency is that they often

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,149
focus on irrelevant metrics and they

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,380
don't they don't really know that we

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:26,730
think for a living and they don't know

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,019
what thinking looks like it's hard to

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,449
put a dollar value on your thoughts so

00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,860
let's get to the point already we're

00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:36,750
professional thinkers I don't think

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,310
that's a stretch and thinking happens

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,230
everywhere it follows this home and

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,269
invades us in the shower it interrupts

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,730
us in conversations it comes to dinner

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:47,579
much to the chagrin of our significant

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,440
others thinking is really what we are

00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:53,310
getting paid to do and and personally I

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,079
think coding is easy part we spent a lot

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,360
of time honing our code craft we learn

00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:00,180
new programming languages we discuss

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,540
esoteric points of frameworks we do code

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,680
Coty's but are we spending enough time

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:12,120
keeping all of the right tools sharp I

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:13,290
would keeping our minds healthy also the

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,850
best pace for thinking is not

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,740
necessarily the best place for coding

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,860
and I and kind of want to get into that

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,329
too have you ever tried to code in the

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,699
shower I do a lot of really good

00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:26,250
thinking there but I'm not bringing my

00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:27,839
macbook in there so are we providing

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,300
ourselves with the best environment for

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,689
getting our job done our employers are

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,699
our clients to our clients understand so

00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,899
I think it might be a little clearer now

00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:37,580
that that i'm not talking about

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,890
waterfall

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,630
you know this is nothing to do with

00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,600
agile or waterfall development or big

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:50,070
upfront design my team I actually think

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,660
is a pretty good pretty good agile team

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,600
I don't even know what agile means but I

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,460
think my team is pretty good at the

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,520
important parts of it and that's what

00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:02,100
matters so this is more about giving

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,080
ourselves time to think doing our

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,029
thinking at the right time understanding

00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,410
that unconscious thought has value and

00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:13,440
factoring it into our plans and our

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:15,270
specifications the end result of both

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,940
active and passive thought is not

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:23,400
necessarily going to be some kind of

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:25,140
waterfall situation so how do I get you

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:33,240
to agree with me and you know I totally

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:35,520
forgot to put a sombrero on this so i

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,620
think there's plenty of kind of odd

00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,620
precedent in the industry that weird

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:44,310
thinkers you think about architecture

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,839
roles for for our best thinkers we're

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,460
starting to realize that you get to a

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,200
point where you just can't push

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:57,620
everybody into management just because

00:14:49,200 --> 00:15:00,750
they're in my case 35 but we we need to

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,690
we need to understand that companies are

00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,610
realizing this you think about TDD style

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,380
this is a great example you can think of

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,450
t dds thought driven development right

00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,620
where you're focusing on solutions and

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,880
outcomes and you know kind of directing

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:20,310
the development before you actually

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:23,630
write your system code other than this

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,070
one this one's kind of evil but

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,270
employment agreements I don't know if

00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,160
anyone's ever signed when I personally

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,080
haven't but there are these employment

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,459
agreements that are pretty pervasive in

00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,060
some areas of the industry where

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,890
employers are actually saying they own

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,839
they want you to sign over that you own

00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,690
that they own any code that you've

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,890
written at any time day or night it

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,290
doesn't matter and what they're really

00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:48,750
saying is that we are paying for your

00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,670
thoughts all of your thoughts whenever

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,250
they occur as soon as they

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:59,130
fest themself is code on the page we own

00:15:53,250 --> 00:16:00,780
them so I'm a programmer right so I'm

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,680
really good at getting up and talking

00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,960
about what I think or at least what I

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,840
think I think or you know but let's

00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,180
let's assume that I've won you over

00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,500
let's assume that you believe me and

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,290
we're thinkers and that's what we need

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:20,670
to focus on let's let's see what other

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:23,070
thinkers have to say about this this is

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,500
point correct point Caray was a pretty

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,880
decent mathematician the point grey

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,980
conjecture was one of the Millennium

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,880
prizes so he was thinking about some

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:35,460
pretty difficult stuff and it's often

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,930
written that point grey would work from

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:41,580
10 to 12 in the late morning and then

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,230
work again from five to seven in the

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,290
evening never working more than four

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,420
hours a day and he said that he found

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,280
that it just wasn't useful to work any

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,890
more than that he couldn't do the type

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:56,250
of thinking he had to do and continue

00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:59,190
these long workdays so that's anecdotal

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,810
at best but recent research from the

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:06,000
Florida State from out of Florida State

00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:10,850
University studied people who excel in

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,850
their fields mathematician or musicians

00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:17,940
elite chess players actors you know

00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:20,400
people and it found that that in general

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:24,360
the people who tended to excel the

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:28,800
elites had had different patterns of

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,910
work and it seemed like it was 90 our 90

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,080
minutes at a time with nice long breaks

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:38,220
rarely working more than four and a half

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,770
hours a day and this is interesting

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,840
because it has ramifications to how we

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,300
work in the office if we can if this

00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,450
research asserts that every 90 minutes

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,940
we have a point where we hit a mental

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,610
fatigue and we really need to kind of

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,170
reboot but what does reboot mean means

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,640
having a conversation it means doing

00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,400
something else other than intense

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,410
thought or intense focus and our

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,060
co-workers may not understand why we

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,290
have our nerf guns in the office at the

00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,370
ready or why we occasion

00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:10,320
fly a small blimp around the office

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:14,400
because we need to take a break every 90

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,900
minutes so also we know that under some

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
circumstances there's research that

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,630
shows conscious thought deteriorates in

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,960
quality over long periods of time so I

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:34,320
want to kind of get to my first question

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:36,120
are you working too much so four and a

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,100
half hours a day doesn't really seem

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,620
like much time to get any work done does

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:44,940
it not with our lives right so there's

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,920
been a great deal of research in

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,870
unconscious cognition and I'm sure we've

00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,340
mostly all experienced this right have

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,380
you ever fallen asleep trying to figure

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,790
out who that actor on doctor who was and

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,740
you wake up the next morning go oh yeah

00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,030
I remember their name um it's cuz your

00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,360
brain was working on the problem when

00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:03,960
you were asleep there was an apartment

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,000
study where well study about this and

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,590
they used apartments and they took these

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,240
listings of apartments and one of them

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,490
was significantly better than the rest

00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,860
but it was subtle it wasn't in ways that

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,840
would just jump out at you so the

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,940
subjects were asked to either choose

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,110
immediately which was the best apartment

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:25,230
or choose after some period of goofing

00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:29,280
off and it turns out that the subjects

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:32,910
that were asked to choose after goofing

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,880
off chose almost twice chose the right

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,620
apartment almost twice as much as those

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,090
that were asked to kind of guess right

00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,790
away but this is kind of interesting

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,960
because it tells us that the brain was

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,160
your brain was working on the problem

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,330
even though you were engaged in other

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,970
activities and you know how do you

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,980
explain that to your other co-workers or

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,540
to your clients how do you even built

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,950
for that if you're if you're a

00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:00,660
consultant so my next question is we're

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,850
always working on some problems whether

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:09,080
we like it or not we have no choice in

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:11,490
the matter there's another study similar

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,440
subjects were asked to recall a list of

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,210
words the subjects that were asked to

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,280
recall the words after eight hours of

00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,150
waking relaxation did significantly

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,370
worse

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,720
then the subjects that were asked to

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,800
recall the words after eight hours of

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,810
sleep so you know wait here's our new

00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,640
another question you mean even when

00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:34,470
we're asleep we are still working and

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:38,120
possibly harder on some problems so

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,260
we're talking about thinking and kind of

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,640
when you how your brain is working when

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,660
you're not actively engaged in something

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,200
but what about when you're actually

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,400
getting things done well other research

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,320
implies that there is a divide between

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,870
the thinking mind set and the doing

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,410
mindset and that you can only really be

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:57,150
in one state at a time so furthermore

00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,700
some individuals spend more time in one

00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,560
state than the other so if this is true

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,960
maybe we shouldn't try to fight our

00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,820
current state and choose our tasks that

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,410
fit whatever our mental motives right

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,090
now a question here would be how do we

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,400
optimize our mental state for the task

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:17,010
at hand pair programming for example

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,480
where one is maybe the doer and one is

00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,920
maybe the thinker things like that how

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,620
do we integrate this into an environment

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,000
and how do we allocate our teams based

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:29,790
on the state of mind that they're

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,920
currently in so what about when we're

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:35,610
actively working many of you probably

00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,430
heard of Miller's losses we can put

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,100
seven things plus or minus two in memory

00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:43,650
and working memory at any given time but

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,930
programmers routinely solve problems

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:49,050
with hundreds or even thousands of

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,820
variables in them so the question here

00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,620
is if we can only have finite working

00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,120
memory space how can we possibly keep

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:58,710
track of hundreds or thousands of

00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:02,760
variables I'm going to skip this slide

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:06,170
because i'm running shorter so it was

00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,670
just a reiteration of the previous slide

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,680
so what we're really talking about is

00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:12,960
problem solving and problem solving

00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,880
could be thought it was a feedback loop

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,440
of think learn and then apply so

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,510
learning is a pretty important part of

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,950
thinking in what we do anyways because

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:27,180
we're problem solvers and I started out

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,280
with an assertion that for any given

00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,870
unsolved problem you're unlikely to be

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,570
an expert in that problem so

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,000
so if that's true then you need to

00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,650
realize that you need to learn something

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,660
before you can get to the solution

00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,880
you're looking for so the question here

00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,710
is considering that learning is a key

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,960
part of problem solving what can we do

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:54,070
to make sure we are providing ourselves

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:55,750
with a good learning environment several

00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,790
studies assert that activating more of

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,559
the brain while engaged in an activity

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,900
or in thought increased mental

00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,000
productivity so even if the extra

00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,960
activity is something like drumming on a

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,679
desk or thumping your foot it shows that

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,330
it actually helps so it doesn't have to

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,530
have anything to do spinning a pen with

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:20,020
your hand and music is an excellent

00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:21,910
multi-sensory small T sensory stimulant

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,390
and research shows that surgeons

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:29,320
performed better when listening to music

00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:30,700
that they enjoyed also a friend of mine

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,750
is involved in a program called fresh

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:39,150
prep where he wrote a bunch of hip-hop

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:42,610
style lyrics to global studies but

00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:45,130
classes and they took a selection of

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,530
students that if that had failed the

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,360
global studies Regents exam five or more

00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,429
times and then they gave him a 12-day

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,880
course where they learned global studies

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,740
through hip-hop and yeah very

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,500
interesting seventy-nine percent of them

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,059
passed those that have failed five or

00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,650
more times before that including a

00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:06,010
hundred percent of those with special to

00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,600
special needs or disabilities in

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,940
pragmatic thinking and learning Andy

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,240
hunt also talks about a situation where

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,870
they they had a team that was struggling

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:19,270
to spec out a system actually act the

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,100
system out literally everyone picked a

00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,540
role and oh you're this object here this

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,750
object and they were running across the

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:28,210
hallway that's also anecdotal but it was

00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,800
interesting so question here is what can

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:34,210
we do to augment our approach to problem

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,770
solving this is a wild card here but

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,050
neurogenesis is the ability to regrow

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:42,610
brain cells right and we always think

00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:44,440
that as we age our brains decline and we

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,410
don't regrow cells that's what research

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,010
used to

00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:51,080
indicate but it turns out that in recent

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:54,920
studies with lab mice it had nothing to

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,690
do with age the study showed that it had

00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,610
to do with the environment that the mice

00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,230
were in and mice that were in active

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,120
enriching environments actually we're

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,700
able to grow brain cells regenerate

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,890
brain cells and have more healthy minds

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,690
as they aged so the question here is

00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,340
does constant exposure to dull

00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:15,950
repetitive environments sound anything

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:17,870
like your workplace we're sorry Mario

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,000
the answers are in another castle I

00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,490
don't have any answers for you all I

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,840
have is a bunch of questions and that's

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:28,070
kind of the point right if we're talking

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,990
about thinking but you know I do have a

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,340
couple of points that that I'd like to

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,380
make or some things that could kind of

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,500
help you along the way there's a

00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,910
technique called the five wise and when

00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,120
you have a question or a problem you're

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:43,250
trying to solve the its research shows

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:48,590
that if you ask yourself why and give it

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:52,580
iteratively five iterations is enough to

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:54,860
get to the bottom of the problem in this

00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,500
case i noticed that i often stopped too

00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,390
soon or in i guess it would say Miss

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:04,550
Roberts from our Bobby tables example

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:06,440
often stops too soon also returning to

00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,870
the point Caray example his four hours

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,660
of work was probably four hours of

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,130
fairly intense thought and if we're in a

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,800
working mode if doesn't mean we're ready

00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,680
to code so try to be aware of your

00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,570
current mental modes and assign your

00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,310
tasks appropriately i personally know

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,430
that I'm much better at coding from

00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:27,500
eight until midnight then I am at nine

00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:30,710
in the morning so when my capacity as a

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,840
manager 925 kind of works because I'm

00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,030
thinking I'm pair programming I'm

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,540
co-piloting I'm doing more of the

00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,710
thought work but when I was a programmer

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,710
I'm still a programmer but when I was

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,720
always coding all the time it was really

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,220
frustrating if I had to go into an

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,170
office all day because I wanted to work

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,890
at night that was my brain was ready to

00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:53,480
go my belief is that it had to settle

00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,660
down a bit I had to be ready to stop

00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,850
thinking before I could actually code

00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,420
stop taking on too much this one should

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,430
be obvious

00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,410
right just because you can finish one

00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:05,690
project in one month does not mean you

00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:11,510
can finish six projects concurrently in

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:14,840
six months recognized environmental

00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:17,840
constructs if mental health has a lot to

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,580
do with the environment you're in we may

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,530
need to take better consideration at the

00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:29,210
environments we're working in and also

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:32,120
sleep on it this sorry this doesn't mean

00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:34,520
taking a nap it means taking a walk talk

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,140
about the last episode of eureka stare

00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,030
out the window blankly do something that

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:42,080
is not active coding and do it all the

00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:46,310
time give your brain a chance to catch

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,440
up to your code so we have a lot of

00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:51,850
decisions to make every day like which

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:55,000
restroom to use and I think you'll see

00:27:51,850 --> 00:28:03,590
that a little health careful analysis

00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:07,550
can go a long way so these are some of

00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:09,200
the books I use for this talk actually

00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,310
they're all pretty good erika von states

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,850
is a friend of mine and he did a great

00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:17,590
talk at ruby comp a few years back

00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,590
called effective and creative coding

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:24,610
most of all my images were wikimedia
