	Title: Escalating complexity: DevOps learnings from Air France 447
Presented by: Lindsay Holmwood

On June 1, 2009 Air France 447 crashed into the Atlantic ocean killing all 228 passengers and crew. The 15 minutes leading up to the impact were a terrifying demonstration of the how thick the fog of war is in complex systems.
Mainstream reports of the incident put the blame on the pilots - a common motif in incident reports that conveniently ignore a simple fact: people were just actors within a complex system, doing their best based on the information at hand.
While the systems you build and operate likely don't control the fate of people's lives, they share many of the same complexity characteristics. Dev and Ops can learn an abundance from how the feedback loops between these aviation systems are designed and how these systems are operated.
In this talk Lindsay will cover what happened on the flight, why the mainstream explanation doesn't add up, how design assumptions can impact people's ability to respond to rapidly developing situations, and how to improve your operational effectiveness when dealing with rapidly developing failure scenarios.

good afternoon everyone my name is

00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,529
Lindsay homewood I'm oxys us on Twitter

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,059
I'm an engineering manager at

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,669
bulletproof networks which is a managed

00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,870
hosting company in Sydney Australia

00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:35,670
alright so I live in this area called

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,860
the Blue Mountains which is like the

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,089
Grand County with the trees and you may

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,620
know me from some of these other

00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:42,540
projects cucumber na geos which allows

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,640
you to write nagios checks cucumber

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,010
massage for graphing data in the browser

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,059
from collecting and flapjack which

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,689
you're interested you can come and talk

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,689
to me about later on ok

00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:06,930
mainstream explanation for what happened

00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,050
was that this was the pilots

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,330
misunderstanding their circumstances

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,219
that they were poorly trained they

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:20,399
failed to react swiftly and they ignored

00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:22,349
alarms and this was a view espouse from

00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,460
you know very major well known

00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:28,080
publications that we sort of know and

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,800
expect to deliver something reasonably

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,610
accurate something that we trust maybe

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,349
not this mode over and this is a very

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,729
convenient narrative for what happened

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,729
in the final 15 minutes of the flight

00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:45,449
specifically decomposing all the

00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:47,009
different things that happened and

00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:50,089
trying to hone in on the broken

00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:54,119
component and find that root cause and

00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:56,969
the simplest records is this human error

00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:59,759
the pilots were negligent they weren't

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:02,610
following their training they crash the

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,389
plane this feeds into this concept of

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,309
having bad apples amoral actors in our

00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,659
systems they're actively working against

00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:12,990
the normal functioning of that system

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:14,879
and then there's this mentality of if we

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,599
weed out the bad apples then maybe that

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,759
system will equalize but Sydney Decker

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,469
who is a professor of human factors in

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,839
flight safety at Lund University in

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:27,209
Sweden says the what you call is root

00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,649
cause what you pull reports is soon to

00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,680
the place that you stop looking any

00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:34,680
further so why don't we start looking a

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,199
little bit further let's look at the

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,519
flight experience of the people that

00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:40,139
were operating the plane given that they

00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,550
were apparently poorly trained and

00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:46,110
inexperienced we have Captain dubov ten

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,769
thousand nine hundred and eighty eight

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,870
flying hours of which 6258 of them were

00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:56,790
as captain on this particular plane and

00:08:51,870 --> 00:09:00,439
Airbus a330 there were 1000 747 flying

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:07,160
hours as Captain let's look at robear

00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:11,240
first officer 6547 flying hours of which

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:15,670
4479 of them one a neighbor airbus a330

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:19,549
Bernie most junior pilot

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:24,350
2930 six hours of which 807 Warren aver

00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:26,420
and Airbus a330 now does this sound like

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,139
that they are inexperienced certainly

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,459
had a lot of flying hours and there's a

00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:33,889
fundamental problem with this particular

00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:35,629
mindset which is what happens if you

00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:37,670
substitute other people into exactly the

00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:39,439
same situation how are they going to

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,799
react under the same stresses and

00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:45,350
pressures and be EA which is the French

00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,639
equivalent of the FAA came to exactly

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,709
the same conclusion in the report

00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,809
specifically a different crew should

00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:55,399
have done exactly the same action we

00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:57,769
cannot blame this crew and that feeds

00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,889
into this idea of people just being

00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:02,329
actors in a complex system in fact you

00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:04,519
could think of them as a system within a

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:05,929
complex system or maybe a series of

00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,499
systems within a series of massive

00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:12,980
complex systems how does that tally with

00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:15,769
this idea of a root cause a very

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,989
Cartesian Newtonian world view where you

00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:20,419
have actions have equal and opposite

00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:22,850
reactions and if you follow the trail of

00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,959
events or linear trail events you can go

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,910
all the way back to the beginning and

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,860
the vast majority of cases in our

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:31,040
society we attribute that to human error

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,929
and the real problem with that worldview

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,230
is that hindsight does not in any way

00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:38,239
equal foresight hindsight converts a

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,369
once Vega unlikely future into an

00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:43,129
immediate certain past also boasted

00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:44,689
nadeko we're very lucky and we have all

00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:47,660
the facts we have them all nicely

00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:51,399
conveniently laid out for us in front of

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:54,110
us and those facts were very hard earned

00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,119
it was a three-year operation to dredge

00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:01,329
firstly to identify where the plane

00:10:56,119 --> 00:11:01,329
crashed then to dredge the ocean

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:18,700
to eventually settle on the flight data

00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:20,980
recorder and once we had the flight data

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,810
recorder we could crack that open and we

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,050
could look at all the different figures

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,580
and numbers and graph them we also have

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,930
meteorological information that we could

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:34,089
refer to as well then we can correlate

00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:35,620
with that data that we retrieved on top

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:39,760
of that we have survey maps as well of

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:43,690
the ocean that investigation took three

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:48,580
years for an event that unfolded in 10

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:50,500
minutes and the problem was that the

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,839
actors in a complex system the pilots

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,480
were operating in a very dense and thick

00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,520
fog of war they had limited facts at

00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,709
hand and the situation was rapidly

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,560
developing and they were applying a

00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:04,450
concept called local rationality which

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,279
is basically that people make what they

00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,100
think of the best decisions based on the

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,360
data at hand and we're very lucky in

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,459
that we have hindsight you know it

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,600
affords ask global rationality we have

00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:16,079
all the facts we have all the figures

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,300
and we can piece them all together and

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,829
your decomposed stuff and find the

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,089
broken component and blame that in this

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:25,420
particular case of as the humans that

00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:27,250
was the broken component apparently so

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,920
let's go deeper what were the systems

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,660
that were actually in play let's go

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,450
let's go have a look at the modes of

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,920
operation of those particular systems so

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,630
you've got a bunch of flight control

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,360
modes that the flight control computer

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,630
is operating under and these these are

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,079
to do with taxing on the runway in

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,310
normal law maintaining an altitude and

00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,070
the attitude of the plane in flight

00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:53,350
flare mode as well for landing the plane

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,230
and vast majority of time and airbus

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:59,110
a330 em in fact most airbus aeroplanes

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,790
are operating in this normal law but

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,550
sometimes they will transition into this

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,839
other law called alternate law and plane

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,850
has very very different flight

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,810
characteristics when its operating a

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,790
normal law sorry alternate law so one of

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,370
the one of the senses that's providing

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,779
information to the flight control

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,180
computer is this thing here it's called

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,560
the pitot tube basically meshes

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,130
pressure in front and behind at the

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,070
plane and you can see here on this is

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:29,500
actually the Air France 447 plane itself

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,520
on the undercarriage of it and there's

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,920
actually a bunch of different pitot

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,560
tubes so a nice redundant system which

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,600
is awesome we've got a pedo probe for

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,330
first officer for the captain and

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,580
standby as well and all this information

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,440
is fed into the flight control computer

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:48,010
over a series of pneumatic Lines and

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,110
electrical lines the problem with this

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:53,920
though is the law reconfiguration

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,630
feedback how specifically the pilots are

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,700
made aware that the plane has the flight

00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:00,250
control computer has migrated from one

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,140
mode to another so we're very very lucky

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,390
in hindsight to be able to actually see

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,620
this information in fact was some of the

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,960
first information that ever Cape the

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,120
hand when people started investigating

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,540
this incident so there's a system called

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,460
a cars and basically radios important

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,770
information from the plane to a

00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,840
satellite to a ground station goes over

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,150
the ACARS network on land and then it

00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,360
goes to Air France or whoever the

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,160
airline operator is and there's a bunch

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,040
of important information that our relays

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,900
here non-vocal communication messages

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,070
operational computer messages

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,100
communication messages and maintenance

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,930
messages and so we had this data set to

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,920
be able to look at in fact this is you

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,840
know like I said this is the first

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,280
starter that the investigators were over

00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,690
to look at the quite a lot of events

00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,510
that are happening here in the last sort

00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,490
of ten minutes but this particular one

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,410
here is really really telling it's

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,360
actually saying that the flight control

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:56,080
computer is migrated from this normal

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,340
law to an alternate law unfortunately

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,370
the feedback that was provided the

00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:03,190
pilots was that a small textual warning

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:06,150
on enormous dashboard with all the knobs

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:08,050
bells and whistles that you can imagine

00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,960
unfortunately while this was being

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,550
communicated on the dashboards the

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,650
realization didn't actually kick in

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,690
until a few minutes later so

00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,730
specifically these three comments you

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,170
are really really telling sober name is

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,850
saying that oh actually I had been

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,770
pitching the nose up for a while now and

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,660
the captain realizes about two seconds

00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,770
later Oh actually were installed that

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,740
explains everything that's happening

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:31,390
unfortunately by that point that was

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:36,340
you know 40 seconds before the plan was

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:40,120
about to pancake in the ocean so how

00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:41,230
does your H a provide you feedback do

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,120
you have any sort of reconfiguration

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,760
feedback when it migrates from one mode

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,040
to another do you understand how these

00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,410
modes behave differently like in a

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,840
database clustering software monitoring

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,310
system that sort of thing do you know

00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,380
all the modes that your system can

00:15:54,310 --> 00:16:00,550
operate under have you seen all of those

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,650
modes really important fundamental

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,210
concept here is sensory feedback so

00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,950
you're providing contextually relevant

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,560
information to people that are operating

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:11,740
that system and one very simple way of

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,750
doing that is obvious and obvious change

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:17,740
in the color of the messages you're

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,030
providing back the size and the font and

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,340
that has some interesting implications

00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:23,830
so everyone put your hands up who here

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:27,130
is able to see three colors on this

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:31,450
screen okay great who here is seeing two

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:35,500
colors okay and who here is seeing one

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:37,270
color okay that's been interesting so um

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,550
ten percent of the male population is

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,020
colorblind so tempers fan of the male

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,240
population wouldn't actually be able to

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,320
distinguish between those colors that's

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,670
pretty important from an alert

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:52,180
perspective what about type who hear

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:54,940
things that this is easy to read it's

00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:59,170
atrocious isn't it that's a hell of a

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:03,670
lot easier isn't it mm-hmm what about

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,740
that no you all groan you all groan but

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:10,180
it turns out the comics and is actually

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:12,550
a really really easy to decipher form of

00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,170
type I'm not in any way suggesting you

00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,840
go out and redesign all your interfaces

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:19,630
to use Comic Sans but need to be aware

00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,220
of this sort of thing and what you're

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,830
trying to really do here is optimized

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,600
for you at 3am you want these systems to

00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:28,780
be as operable as possible when you're

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,470
operating in a high-stress probably

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,970
sleep deprived incident let's have a

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,940
look at another system that was

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,060
operating here the input control

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,340
specifically the copilot feedback now in

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,630
airbus planes when one pilot is pulling

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,580
back on the sick or pushing down

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,170
a stick there's actually no tactile

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,930
feedback that's provided to the other

00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:52,420
pilot so for a very large portion of

00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,950
this incident incident burning was

00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,490
pulling back on the stick which was

00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:00,100
causing the plane to ascend until it got

00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,830
to such a high altitude 38,000 feet the

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:07,060
oxygen started petering out and then the

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:09,010
plane stalled all the way the other

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,780
problem is the flight control computer

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,000
so the flight control computer actually

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,740
averages the inputs from the two

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,600
different control sticks so if you have

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,630
one pilot pushing down on the stick and

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,740
another pilot pushing up on the stick it

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,940
actually just cancels out one another

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,220
now there is a little bit of feedback

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,890
that's provided to the operators we've

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,630
got this duel impact dual input feedback

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,430
right here but as you can see it's

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:38,140
another very small light in a very large

00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:40,300
dashboard and Airbus advocates that that

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,000
pilots use this system called CRM crew

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,880
resource management to handle the

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,230
communication between the pilots to

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,840
vocalize what everyone is thinking at

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,520
any point of time when unfortunately in

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,750
high-stress situations like this you

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,550
have a thing called the startling effect

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,430
where basically people just shut down

00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:59,590
and they start reverting to a

00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,700
well-trained behavior sometimes that

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,420
will train behavior in this particular

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,420
scenario

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:24,610
how about that hey there we go so in the

00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,710
startling effect you basically shut down

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,040
and you revert to that normal training

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,110
and in this particular case in Air

00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,480
France 447 if the pilots had actually

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,680
not touched any of the controls that

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,260
would have actually come out alive but

00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,790
again we have global rationality oh we

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,780
have we can we can see everything we

00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:47,410
have all the facts at hand so are your

00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,210
inputs averaged how do you have your

00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,950
engineers troubleshoot during incidents

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,210
how do you handle the coordination

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,680
between those engineer's how do you know

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,450
the two people aren't working on two

00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,290
system on the same system at the same

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:01,900
time is it in every man for himself sort

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,120
of scenario or are you coordinating the

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,550
changes to somebody actually have an

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,830
overview of that and specifically does

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,810
it is that responsibility assigned to

00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,540
someone do you have a process for doing

00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:16,120
that how is the information disseminated

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,270
within the team that's responding to

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,980
that incident and most importantly how

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,660
is that information getting outside of

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,090
that incident response team to the

00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,010
business now you look at tumblr last

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,390
year they had an 18-hour outage well

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,820
they had a very very long outage but

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:34,060
there are 18 hours between updates

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,800
that's sort of bad do you have a

00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,600
formalized process for this or is it a

00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,150
like a focal process something that

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,650
happens on an ad hoc basis and if you

00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:45,280
have a process you're actually actively

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:47,110
practicing this and I suppose at a high

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,180
level what data are you actually relying

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,500
on do you all are you all singing from

00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:54,910
the same in book you all looking at the

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:56,860
same data fairly interesting question so

00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,390
one simple way to mitigate a lot of

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,090
these effects is to actually care when

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,960
you're responding to incidents so

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,250
hopefully you have enough people in your

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,240
team where you can now we compare it

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,220
with somebody when you're dealing with

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,600
one of these problems and a really

00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,940
important thing to do here is vocalize

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,920
so you're actually you know it's sort of

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,990
like a stream of conscious consciousness

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,000
with an internal monologue but make that

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,890
internal monologue external the other

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,360
person knows what you're thinking and

00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,520
it's really important you're making

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,380
these changes as well to minimize and

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,520
compartmentalize those changes

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:29,140
and really importantly for analysis

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,490
later on is to actually record all the

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,070
changes that you're making so that you

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:36,000
can construct a timeline it's hopefully

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,920
maintained by your coordinator and it's

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,560
massively useful for enabling

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:45,040
retrospectives so another system that

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:48,610
was a play was the heads-up display so

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,690
there are isolated sensors here so if

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,180
you look at the bottom of the plane

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,480
again we've got the pitot tubes for the

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,930
first officer captain and stand by and

00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,300
unfortunately they started reporting

00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,340
back completely different values because

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,310
some of the senses froze up and then

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,630
they thawed and it froze up again but

00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,450
they're all working with completely

00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,070
different information all the pilots so

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,870
very significant discrepancies between

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,030
all this and you can see this pretty

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,060
clearly here right you're climbing no

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:21,250
I'm going down okay we're going down Oh

00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,600
actually I'm climbing again and this

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,090
this particular one down here is

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,240
particularly great so we're in toga it

00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,740
stands for takeoff go around so the the

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,690
flight control computer is relaying to

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,990
the pilots that it think that they think

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:37,600
that they're actually taking off so so

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,770
all the data is fairly badly managed at

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,620
this point it's completely unreliable

00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,270
and Airbus take the position that well

00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,310
you should be using CRM to manage that

00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,200
but unfortunately if you have a fairly

00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,730
reduce adaptive capacity because you're

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,630
dealing with you know you're in a

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,250
high-stress situation that's that sort

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,820
of your communication isn't necessarily

00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,290
just going to happen so I fundamentally

00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,250
believe there's actually significantly

00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:05,200
different navigational requirements when

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,760
it comes to responding to incidents so

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,760
context your navigation is really really

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,620
important you want to have some sort of

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,640
high-level dashboard overview of what's

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,140
happening across all your different

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,370
systems and you want to be able to deep

00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,750
dive on the details to test a theory and

00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,850
this is really about taking the

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,580
scientific method and improvising in a

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:27,780
very very short feedback loop so you

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:30,490
know come up with a hypothesis test it

00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,660
reevaluate do this in a big loop and

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,370
it's really important when you're doing

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,570
that sort of thing here to make sure

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,610
that that information

00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:38,380
is linkable so that you can share with

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,350
other people on the team that are

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:44,590
responding to incidents as well Ryan

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,299
Tamiko gave a really good talk about

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,179
October last year I'm talking about

00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:50,049
distributor teams within github and one

00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,549
of the interesting things that he

00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:53,409
mentioned was that they try and make

00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:54,909
everything internally linkable so

00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:57,279
everything has a reference that people

00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:58,720
can point back to and this is really

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,309
important from a correlation perspective

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,720
because you'll have different people

00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:03,820
that are working on different problems

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,110
under the same umbrella need to be able

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,720
to you need to be able to correlate

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,309
between those different threads of

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,419
Investigation doesn't make sense when

00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:12,009
you're dealing with the situation like

00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:13,570
this for everyone to have a single train

00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:15,519
train of thought like a linear

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,309
progression you can have multiple people

00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,899
working on this at any at any time ray

00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:22,149
and human pattern recognition here is

00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:23,590
actually pretty down good provider that

00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:26,139
you have enough adaptive capacity you

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:30,700
have enough cognitive slack to be able

00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:32,580
to test out and try different ideas so

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:38,049
one thing that factors into that is

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:42,220
stream of alerts so there was actually

00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:45,309
70 stall warnings during during the last

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,769
15 minutes and that's what sort of leads

00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:51,909
to analysis like this you know they

00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:54,490
ignored the alarms right they should

00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:55,750
have reacted there's also a bunch of

00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,240
other things that are happening as well

00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:00,370
an autopilot disconnect there's a

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,409
specific tone that this that the

00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:04,419
aircraft emits when this happens it's

00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:07,570
called the Calvary charge it's very very

00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:08,559
loud quite disorienting and then of

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,269
course we have the alternate law

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,470
reconfiguration happening as well so you

00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:13,929
know lots of different things happening

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,879
simultaneously how on earth are you

00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,710
meant to know the priority of the

00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:21,100
different alerts when you're being

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,139
completely overloaded so pilot ended up

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,240
being overwhelmed by feedback this is a

00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:26,799
quite a well-known concept called alert

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,769
fatigue it was quite a lot of talk about

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,389
it at monitor Rama last week and the

00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:33,759
startling effect really plays into here

00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:36,429
as well so reduces the adaptive capacity

00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:41,500
that cognitive slack to be able to deal

00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:42,820
with new stimuli so dampening is one

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,980
very very simple way of solving this

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,750
problem what you want to have is some

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,250
sort of high-level overview that says oh

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:52,800
actually

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:54,480
a you know stuffs broken um one really

00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,550
simple way to do this is just a manual

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,310
silence so you take a monitoring system

00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,480
you keep it running the monitoring

00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,730
checks but you disable the notifications

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,890
so they're not overwhelming the people

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,660
that are on call another simple way of

00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,370
doing this from an incident response

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,930
perspective is limiting the number of

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:14,430
engineers that are actually watching

00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:15,660
those alerts and those graphs maybe we

00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,480
could do smarter things with tools as

00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,100
well so pagerduty sort of does something

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,870
similar to this already or if you have

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,320
more than one alert that's assigned to

00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,990
an on-call engineer it will provide a

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,250
summary alert for all subsequent of

00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,400
loads to come in so rather than sending

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,300
out 400 alerts you send our one there's

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,130
another project that I've been working

00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,660
on quad flapjack that's sort of trying

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,590
to achieve a similar sort of thing if

00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,940
you're interested come and have a chat

00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:44,010
after this so the crux of this talk is

00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,690
really about systems thinking and not

00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,970
looking at things in isolation and try

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,570
to decompose things from a Cartesian

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,770
Newtonian perspective we need to

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,080
internalize that the systems that we're

00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,450
working on a capable of failure but

00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,980
they're also capable of success in fact

00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:03,060
they're really just modes of operation

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:05,550
shades of grey so we have systems that

00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,110
enable communication that also exposed

00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,880
secrets a really good example of that is

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,740
the US diplomatic cables that were

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,320
leaked by a WikiLeaks few years back

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,360
very very useful for providing sensitive

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,840
information to people in government not

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,000
so great if you air all of that publicly

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,800
you have systems that might rob us but

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,630
they're also systems the fun innovation

00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:30,060
like New York bankers we are systems to

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,830
kill us and they're also the same

00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,740
systems that allow billions of people

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:36,990
every year to fly around the world

00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,880
failure is fundamentally pervasive and

00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,440
in complex systems like the complex

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,920
systems that we're operating complex

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,350
failure is complex failure is just

00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:49,020
another normal mode of operation you

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,910
have to learn to expect it your systems

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,790
probably aren't controlling the fate of

00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:57,050
people's lives but you may have people

00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,050
that are pending on it quite a bit

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:02,640
and we really need to move away from

00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,950
this position of anthropocentrism which

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,240
is perceiving the world as humans being

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,280
the center of everything the center of

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,630
the universe need to also be careful

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,640
that we don't drift too far to the other

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,560
end of the spectrum and go towards

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,210
techno centrism which is that you know

00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,480
everything is just one big series of

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,790
nested systems and humans are just a cog

00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,990
not particularly relevant or interesting

00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,880
we're really operating here in the

00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,860
squishy middle ground between the two

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,380
we're talking about building operable

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:31,710
systems you need to face between man and

00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,910
machine there's no amoral actors in any

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,640
of these systems and it's really

00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,740
important to keep that in mind if you

00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,260
look at Chesley Sullenberger who is the

00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,310
pilot that successfully managed to ditch

00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:46,980
and Airbus plane into the Hudson River

00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:48,780
had this particular quote about Al 447

00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,910
if you look at the human factors alone

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,970
and you're missing half or two-thirds of

00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:57,240
the total system failure and adopting

00:28:53,970 --> 00:29:00,800
this mentality is massively important so

00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:03,720
that the final words of man about to die

00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:08,240
isn't turned into a pity newspaper

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,240
headline thank

00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:21,320
all right I got time for two questions I

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:32,000
think I've got a bit of a lure to take

00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,000
going on all right up there

00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:53,539
I haven't seen anything published but

00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:54,499
you should go research that and write up

00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:59,149
about it because that would be really

00:29:54,499 --> 00:30:00,649
interesting sorry the question was so

00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:03,889
there had been any sort of comparisons

00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:29,089
between what happened in Apollo 13 and

00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:31,399
with ar 447 James so the question was

00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:32,599
are there other alerting systems that we

00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:35,419
can look at that maybe solve this

00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:38,869
problem a little bit better every domain

00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:40,700
has significant problems so John also

00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:43,429
has been talking quite a bit recently

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,200
about the problems within within

00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:47,599
medicine and sort of alerts that are

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,679
passed through to people like surgeons

00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,259
when they're dealing with people on the

00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,049
operating table and your massive false

00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:55,909
positives there I don't think anyone is

00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:57,129
dealing with this I think that a lot of

00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:59,299
ways were actually on the cutting edge

00:30:57,129 --> 00:31:02,629
that's cool we just need to find

00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:04,179
solutions if you're interested in this

00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:06,229
sort of thing i can highly recommend

00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:07,539
reading any of these three books by

00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:09,289
sitting decker i would highly recommend

00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:11,659
probably starting with drift into

00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:13,159
failure john rouser gave a great talk of

00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:15,049
velocity a few years ago about knowing

00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:18,679
your data and doing sort of human

00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:20,839
correlation and if you're interested in

00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,399
a long and somewhat depressing read you

00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:25,399
should have a look at the be a report on

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:29,029
the AF 447 incident there's copies of it

00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:31,330
in French and English alright thank you

00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:31,330
very much

00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,290
