as everybody can probably tell my name

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,260
is not Shawn Darcy Shawn was unable to

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,070
make it due to a medical issue

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,619
so unfortunately Shawn didn't send me a

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,570
slide so I put these together last night

00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:33,600
we'll see how it goes

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,420
and again so I was actually pretty

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,340
inspired by Travis's talk so you know I

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,350
don't have a cool picture of a car but

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,180
what I do have is a cool picture of the

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,000
you know first picture of the black hole

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,739
that everybody's anybody's ever taken so

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,430
you know Einstein s general theory of

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,339
relativity it predicts that in a

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,839
sufficiently dense mass will cause black

00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:58,320
holes and we've been able to notice this

00:00:54,839 --> 00:01:00,510
just because stars don't rotate the way

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,129
they're supposed to they something must

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,379
be pulling on them therefore hate black

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,659
holes must exist and in April of this

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,080
year people were able actually to take

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,630
pictures of the radiation that's caused

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,330
at the event horizon and that's what

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,560
this picture is right here so this is

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:23,189
the in the middle of the Messier 87

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,659
galaxy which actually does one they were

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,369
was announced last week and just one the

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,890
breakthrough prize in fundamental

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:34,159
physics which is pretty awesome

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:37,200
and this radiation it hits the earth at

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,630
230 gigahertz so the wavelength of the

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,969
radiation is 1.3 millimeters and if you

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,850
were to point a telescope from the earth

00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:50,969
to where this galaxy exists you would

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,880
need a resolution of one millionth of an

00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:55,350
arc second to actually see it and for

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,119
those people who are involved astronomy

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,920
you know that it's like oh that's pretty

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,079
small but what that means is if you were

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,549
to make one satellite dish to try and

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,049
measure that you'd need a satellite dish

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,300
of 8,000 kilometers long in diameter

00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:11,160
since that's not practical what they end

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,600
up doing is they have multiple satellite

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,490
dishes they actually cross the planet

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,410
which has a much different challenge so

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,960
now all of these satellite dishes need

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,700
to be actually synchronized their sample

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,440
rates need to be synchronized their

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,230
sample rates need to be synchronized at

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,739
the point where they would slip one

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,450
second over 1 million years the the

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,370
sample rate like Michael was talking

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,780
about earlier they only take two bits

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,540
that's what they store on their hard

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,849
drive but their bandwidth is 16

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,410
gigahertz so they take that 230

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:48,239
gigahertz down sample it to 16 down

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,430
converted to 16 and then sample it is 16

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,180
and store two bits on their hard drives

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,680
and these hard drives are neon filled

00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,500
hard drives because they actually create

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,299
350 terabytes a day when they were

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,170
storing it so they they basically got

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:09,060
created a 5 petabytes of information and

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,329
that would be you know 5 million

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,760
gigabytes so when they were done their

00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:19,950
experiments it was faster for the guys

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:22,620
in the Hawaiian Observatory to take the

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,069
hard drives jam them in a suitcase

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,170
put them on an airplane fly to Boston 2

00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,940
mi t--'s a haystack laboratory and

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,959
unpack them there and connect them back

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:38,190
up and even based on that they got 14

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,859
gigabytes per second which is a pretty

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,389
reasonable link for anybody so that they

00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:43,590
couldn't transfer any of the information

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,560
over the internet they had to transfer

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,239
everything by suitcase and what do you

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,609
think of these things like they have to

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,010
handle scattering water vapor in the

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,630
atmosphere frequency stability they have

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,260
to actually correct for movement into

00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:01,620
the tectonic plates they have to correct

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,209
for changes in the oceans tide all these

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,859
kinds of things are huge huge

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,180
computational things that people are

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,730
trying to figure out when they're

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,829
putting this information back together

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,709
so this was a the accumulation of 200

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:17,700
different researchers in many many

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:20,430
different application areas and you know

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,470
it was a big breakthrough for lots and

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,840
lots of people and you know the key

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,270
point about this isn't that it's just

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,260
cool but also it's very

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,760
multidisciplinary it's not just signal

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,210
processing it's not just Radio Astronomy

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,710
is not just compute pieces it's not just

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,090
Python because a lot of the algorithms

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,140
they actually designed to make the

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,210
picture we're actually designed in

00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:48,120
Python where they would light

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:51,509
up there five petabytes of of

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,639
information into Python and you know

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:56,310
when it comes to analog devices what we

00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,620
do is we do some of those similar kinds

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,020
of things we take the physical world we

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,830
sense measure interpret connect to that

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,990
digital world and also power it and on

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,430
the RF side it's the same kind of thing

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,900
we're connecting that electromagnetic

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,370
spectrum up to that digital world and

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,070
just kind of an example of how this has

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,070
changed over time and how we're doing

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:22,080
more than just RF because even in the RF

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,660
domain it's more than just being a good

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,039
RF engineer you have to understand

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,630
digital comms you have to understand

00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,490
digital algorithms you have to

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,750
understand all these digital pieces so

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,330
we'll just look at a communications

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,139
example for now so if we look at an LTE

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,180
base station from 2012 now what the

00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,710
board was pretty giant it had two

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,630
receivers two transmitters and two

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,080
observer paths on it and if you look at

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:49,169
the BOK diagram on the right there

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,539
there's mixers implemented and by CMOS a

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:53,490
TCS and the orange kind of pieces that

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:55,320
are implemented CMOS and then the

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,870
purpley pieces are all discrete filters

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:05,099
so these were hugely large on PCBs and

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,690
then you know from CMOS integration we

00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:10,800
could basically take that down to one

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:13,770
chip even in 2013 but that was more for

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,780
single carrier kinds of applications so

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,759
we'd have a single carrier in that blue

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,650
area on the side of that die was

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,750
basically digital assist it was digital

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,270
algorithms fixing imperfections in the

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,419
CMOS technology to make it perform as

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,560
good as a discrete implementation and

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,599
for single carrier it was pretty good

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,490
and lots of people deployed this kind of

00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,240
thing but have a pretty modest dynamic

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:41,509
range for LTE but if you are a base

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,860
station person especially in 2015 2016

00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,979
you want to make a single base station

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,620
and deployed worldwide which means that

00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:53,039
you still have to support gsm on your

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,409
base station and gsm has much different

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,029
constraints in your system and the

00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:59,099
level of performances needed is much

00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:01,110
much higher so one of the things we

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,629
learned when we moved went from GSM to

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,399
LTE was GSM has a lot of crazy

00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:08,550
constraints on it and LTE is a much

00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,050
easier but to support all these legacy

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,209
phones to support all these emerging

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,989
countries everybody wants to make base

00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:18,529
stations that support both so the die

00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:21,119
size gets bigger is still 65 nanometer

00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:22,919
and that the bigger in the analog

00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:26,099
section is mainly just getting that

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,349
extra 50 DB of SNR improvement but you

00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:31,229
can also see the digital section more

00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:33,360
than doubles or triples and that's more

00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:36,719
digital assist to correct for all these

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,819
algorithms so it's still just to receive

00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:41,610
to transmit but it is a much higher

00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,889
performance and then we can go to things

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,719
like massive MIMO so now we've actually

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,639
gone to 28 nanometer we have four

00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:51,269
transmitted floor receives with digital

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,779
pre-distortion and again now the digital

00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:58,139
piece is almost a quarter of the die and

00:07:53,779 --> 00:08:02,909
as we go to multi band it's it's even

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:05,490
much bigger so the the digital the

00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:07,469
digital assist pieces are almost half of

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,259
the die compared to the other analog

00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:12,949
sections and that's super digital

00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:15,389
complicated filtering IQ correction

00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,919
compensation because the level of

00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:18,719
performance we need to do on the these

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,729
next-generation devices as we actually

00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:22,800
have to do calibration and correction

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:24,389
over voltage calibration and correction

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,159
over temperature calibration and

00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,119
correction over frequency calibration

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,889
correction over all these different

00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:31,469
things where the chip can vary because

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:35,430
CMOS is such a terrible lousy process to

00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:36,630
do RF on but CMOS is great in terms of a

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,130
price point great in terms of

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,169
integration and great in terms of adding

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,149
digital so it's much easier to do these

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,000
these kinds of things but it requires

00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:47,699
different skill sets and so is that

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,290
merging of everybody's ideas together so

00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:53,160
we can kind of see this evolution of how

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:56,639
that digital has moved and grown in the

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,649
system and as that digital is moving and

00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,939
grown in the system one of the things

00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:01,769
that we've looked at and said ok well

00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:06,000
now that we're adding all this digital

00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:07,860
pieces into the RF transceivers what new

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,420
capabilities are people actually asking

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,760
for that we can add

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,950
and the obvious one which I think we've

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,770
talked about before was digital

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,780
pre-distortion so if we look at a chip

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:22,940
where a digital pre-distortion that's

00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:25,530
done off the chip in an FPGA typically

00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,240
the receive section or the observed

00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,820
section has to be running at five times

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,040
the bandwidth and that requires a huge

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,080
amount of power just to transfer the

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,160
data back and forth between an FPGA and

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,600
the transceiver chip and so you can

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,730
think of like now instead of running at

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,280
a hundred mega megahertz of data running

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,460
across the device now you have to run it

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:51,030
five hundred and you know every clock

00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,860
edge is is power so by taking that DPD

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,780
function and putting it into the

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,850
transceiver by putting the actuator in

00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,710
the transceiver we can actually run the

00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,450
interface at a fifth of the rate we go

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:05,820
back to one hundred megahertz and we

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:08,490
save giant amounts of energy so we can

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,040
shrink that FPGA down save some costs as

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,010
well as what our customers tell us is in

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,020
like 64 transmit 64 received systems in

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,940
these massive MIMO systems they save a

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,890
hundred watts of FPGA like a system

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,650
power because they're not doing these

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:26,670
things in the FPGA anymore they're doing

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:29,060
them in a fixed ASIC and so when we kind

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:31,500
of look at this kind of looking back

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,380
what we've kind of called this and what

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,650
other people have called it is this

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:40,260
recombinant innovation and this is

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:46,080
actually a book which is pretty good by

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:48,380
andrew hardigan he's UC Davis and it's

00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,400
like circa 2003 but it's like you know

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:54,060
existing technologies are usually

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:57,390
combinations of objects which in this

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,190
cases are like hardware software the

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,430
ideas like how those things interact

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,050
with each other and the people and the

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,500
people is are the most important thing

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,730
and it's the people who know the ideas

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,290
and objects and how they can work

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,620
together to actually get that benefit

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:16,350
and one of the things he says in this

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,270
book is innovators are no smarter or no

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,690
more courageous than the rest of us they

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,510
are simply better connected and I think

00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,460
I don't know I'm

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,620
hoping that's why everybody comes to

00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,420
conferences like this so they can remain

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,770
connected like listening to the

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,950
presenters and listening to me drone on

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:34,720
I'm sure is interesting but the biggest

00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,180
impact you probably have is talking

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,830
outside talking to the vendors talking

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,420
to everybody else trying to learn how

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,430
people what other people are doing and

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,520
how you can leverage those good ideas in

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,350
your projects so you know when I first

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,840
started out in my career I always wanted

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,450
to be the smartest guy in the room

00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,530
now as like engineering director you

00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,060
want to be the dumbest guy in the room

00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,750
you want to hire people smarter than you

00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,580
and you want to make sure that these

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,940
people get ideas together and our

00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:08,140
driving thing is all in a common manner

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:13,390
and that kind of goes into you know

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:14,740
analog devices always hiring we you know

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,630
in the u.s. if he would just look under

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,240
engineering jobs we have 65 engineering

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,520
jobs open and these are from RF design

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,760
to digital design to systems engineering

00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,100
to algorithm development to to

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,590
everything like because of some of the

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,140
things that we're doing in the health

00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,750
care area we actually have physicians on

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,240
staff which is pretty crazy can you

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,410
imagine going to the Medical School and

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,600
then getting a job at a semiconductor

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,920
company W pretty crazy

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:49,450
that's no worse than getting your PhD I

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:50,530
guess so you know all these technology

00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,230
are really driving tomorrow's

00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:55,390
innovations whether it's from autonomous

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,930
transport or transportation to machines

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:01,570
to 5g to digital health industry 400 or

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,920
immersive consumer and when it comes to

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,680
Adi you know we've been around for a

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,790
long time we have 15,000 employees but

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,310
we have a hundred and twenty-five

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,900
thousand customers and so that's a lot

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,790
of people doing lots of very diverse

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:18,010
things and people trying to leverage

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,230
what we know in their end designs and

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,420
which is great that's what we want to be

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,590
able to do so that's why when we come to

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,270
conferences like the new radio

00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,540
conference we try and do a lot of things

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,550
we've done a lot of presentations I'm

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:34,060
apologized for being this the third my

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,470
third talk but we also have like a lot

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,019
of demos which I hope everybody comes

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,499
over and

00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:42,439
from you know for our export TX phase

00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:44,899
coherent system on a module to the Pluto

00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:49,220
phosphor where we actually do FFTs and

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:54,980
log inside the FPGA the Pluto itself to

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:57,379
the ADM ALM mm radio and then fast

00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,779
frequency hopping but you know analog

00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:01,939
devices has about 45,000 different

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,670
products and everywhere from amplifiers

00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:07,069
two switches multiplexers power data op

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,989
you know there's there's lots of devices

00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:11,569
that we make which go in everybody's

00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:13,279
application and then we kind of look at

00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:15,519
it from a market perspective it's

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,929
aerospace defense its healthcare its

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,299
communications its instrumentation its

00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:21,739
autonomous its energy its power and

00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,329
there's a lot of people that come up to

00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:28,129
me and say okay well you know what group

00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:29,899
am I in and my group and other people

00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:33,379
that are here from Adi we don't belong

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:35,029
in any of these things so what we're

00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:38,029
actually in is called our systems

00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:39,290
development group and we're so special

00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:43,249
the company we don't even get the same

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:45,019
logo as everybody else but what we try

00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,629
and do is try and make it easier for

00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:51,259
people to design in that complex parts

00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:55,689
that Adi makes so for example this

00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:57,889
device the ATR V 9000 was released 2018

00:14:55,689 --> 00:15:00,019
you read through some specs is kind of

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,149
neat and you know the big piece that

00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:04,879
everybody looks at us is like oh phase

00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:06,499
synchronization on the chip synchronized

00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,860
ello is synchronized baseband

00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:11,829
that is a big deal but when the the

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,759
business unit who made it they took

00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:15,410
traditional semiconductor kind of

00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,689
thought processes you take one chip put

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,379
it down on an ATV Lord it's like it will

00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:20,149
show me

00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:21,589
it actually synchronized and there's a

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:23,029
lot of hand waving a lot of datasheet

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,919
pointing and it's a lot of like go read

00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:28,220
the manual yourself and it's hard for

00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:30,649
people so what what we did in our group

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:35,089
is we actually designed this system on

00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:37,549
module with two radio chips on it and a

00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:42,279
zinc and people actually take this and

00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:45,169
are using this for their designs now

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:48,410
here we go so it actually has two radio

00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:49,370
chips a zinc four gig of memory for the

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,050
arms that are in

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,510
they're in for gig of memory for the

00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,640
programmable logic standpoint and people

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,150
are actually deploying this in radar

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,710
systems today and to show that you know

00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,810
it is synchronized it can be

00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,070
synchronized and then we get this to

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,990
some of our customers they hey you know

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,870
this is neat but how do we synchronize

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,610
multiple of these together

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:14,210
because if you are an aerospace defense

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:18,140
company making a thousand element radar

00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:19,700
array you you know synchronizing to is

00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,910
like okay you show me it works but how

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,190
does this scale and so one of the demos

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,779
that we have over there is isn't in this

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,440
quite backplane but it actually shows

00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:34,220
two of these sums synchronized together

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,630
to get an 8x8 an depending upon what

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,960
you're looking for we also work with a

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:42,290
lot of third parties like like our

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,690
customers like epic which have taken the

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,880
Pluto design and actually shrunk it down

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,490
into a tiny form factor industrial

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,990
ruggedized runs over temperature of

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,670
these kinds of things so if if you start

00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,140
out on here and get to a point is like

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,459
hey this is pretty neat but I need

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,830
something that's ruggedized I need

00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,630
something that's in industry worthy of

00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,730
being deployed out in the rain up on a

00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,160
mast then you can actually get that from

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,540
other people so some of the others we

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,750
don't the group that I mean we don't

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,040
just work on radio store comms we also

00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,620
do a lot of other things like 3d

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,500
time-of-flight so this is a platform

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,360
that is a 3d imaging camera that will

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,610
give you images like this they will

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:24,410
connect up to either a Raspberry Pi or a

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:27,170
96 board here's a lidar platform so this

00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:30,140
is a 1d liner where it'll shoot out some

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,090
lasers and then get the reflections back

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,950
goes into a very very high-speed

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,050
converter in the FPGA and see and can

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,970
see it so there's all kinds of sensing

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:41,720
technologies that we're working on from

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,540
3d time-of-flight - lidar - radar we

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,550
also do a lot of other things like

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,410
Arduino shields so these are just our do

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,059
we know shields with rms power detectors

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,610
on them that some people are connecting

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:54,230
to Arduino and using as like Peter was

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:58,190
talking about you know low cost

00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:02,970
instrumentation replacement and we do do

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:05,900
a lot again with you know universities

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,520
working with both circuits

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:11,460
communications power electronics and

00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,670
these fast prototyping so you know we do

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,620
actually have some giveaways on the demo

00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,210
if you come over and give me a card if

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,350
you're a faculty or students we can

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:27,690
probably set you up and definitely I

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:29,910
think the the workshops tomorrow we're

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,970
actually full already but there may be

00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:35,610
some devices leftover on Thursday

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,020
just come come by so with that I just

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:41,570
want to say you know thanks very much

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,570
