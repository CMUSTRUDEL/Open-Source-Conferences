Description: 
	Optimizing Radio Settings for Algorithms by Robin Getz

In the book The Martian, Andy Weir wrote “I’m going to have to science the shit out of this.” While most RF designs aren’t the life and death Mr Weir was writing about in his book; people involved in RF receiver design have the same sort overwhelming odds of not receiving things as Mark Watney did on the surface of Mars.

This presentation will look at Automatic Dependent Surveillance—Broadcast (ADS–B), which uses a 1 Mbit/s Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) scheme at 1090 MHz for airplane position sensing. From defining quality metrics, to making a reproducible test framework, we will explore what sort of radio settings are needed to maximize reception of good packets using a specific radio (in this case the ADALM-PLUTO, which should be also applicable to the NI B200 series and the Nuand BladeRF 2.0 micro).

but yeah just to reiterate what that

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:25,490
became single DMA we have such fun

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,490
experience was I hope you made for like

00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,189
the top they'll be giving now is

00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,160
optimizing the radience and its settings

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,980
for algorithms so like I talked about in

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,840
previous ratio discussions you have a

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,239
challenge that a lot of people have is

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,789
going from devices or chips with the

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:51,989
various to products and there's a lot of

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,969
gap in between there and when companies

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,579
talk about how to solve that challenge

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,019
of the gap you know AdWords when you

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,659
talk about things we thought were going

00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:03,149
from simulation to prototype things of

00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,379
production and legs are going to talk

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,960
about going from research through

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,200
evaluation to design production very

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,400
Hardware separate view the world and

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,470
when we go around was like a radio

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,270
manufacturer or even algorithm design

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,640
companies it's more about research

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,110
algorithm developments design

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,030
elaboration where they take that

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,250
algorithm maybe try to turn it into the

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,689
mix points see how that works on their

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,299
own bit equation that might be able to

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,680
set up the production and one of the

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,570
things like I was talking about earlier

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,110
this morning there are different teams

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,490
there were leads different hardware and

00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:38,340
going from one of these steps the next

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,229
can be a challenge for people so it's

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,750
really figure out this signal processing

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,060
piece and then you get this signal

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,619
process it would be submitted how do we

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,619
call it through group talk to each other

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:53,850
now to all the different groups ensure

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,130
that they will have the concepts that

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,490
they need and the optimizations they

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,990
have when we make these steps so it's

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,100
kind of difficult to talk about this we

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:09,170
abstract so we use actually a very

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:12,150
rudimentary but actually fairly popular

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:15,480
single of hug there today called the 80s

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:18,570
bead so EDSP is basically a replacement

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,250
for active radar so the way radar works

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,800
is it sends a signal from the antenna

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,080
the antenna that signal bounces back

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,770
from the aircraft and we can tell where

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,500
the aircraft

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,950
as those big antennas speak around we

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,720
get above one every eight seconds update

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,470
because that's how long it takes it to

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,290
spin around so therefore we can only

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,090
space airplanes own a certain distances

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,040
because we only know where they are

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,930
once every eight seconds so what

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,970
everybody decided to you know early

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,670
two-thousands was hey we have this great

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,440
guest thing the plane signal gets us so

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,380
whatever he said the planes broadcast us

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,970
their GPS location so once a second the

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,610
planes that had broadcast their GPS

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,730
locator and that's what this ad hasn't

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:12,630
these splitters so there are exceptions

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:16,740
for things so in 2010 the FAA said every

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,750
airframe has to have a DSP outline there

00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,660
are exceptions for them things that like

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,630
don't have batteries don't need to know

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,360
a B has to be out of them and one of the

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,010
reasons we found that out was one of the

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,020
ABI guys lives in Colorado

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,750
he lives near one of the air training

00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,210
centers and he saw a tow plane and a

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,610
glider and he's like oh nice not the car

00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,920
now - all my radio see what the ats-v

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,710
see if there's the idiocy up on the

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,080
glider and the airplane and it's only on

00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,890
the airplane because the quieter than a

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,380
battery

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,510
why would somebody is riding that you

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,090
want to have the best weights to flight

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,830
ratio you don't take giant batteries and

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,930
put them inside so you can actually see

00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,120
this little green line in the middle the

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,340
tow plane circling around in this

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,300
protected airspace because things that

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,880
don't have abs

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,480
II can't fly within 30 nautical miles

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:13,050
into class let's be here perfect but

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,360
this isn't worldwide phenomena so this a

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,760
lot of people actually will take their

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,080
SP ours and a Raspberry Pi lighten arts

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,750
me unless the dollar Raspberry Pi

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,840
there's left software and the election

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,330
reports through various websites where

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,200
airplanes they see are so flight where

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:35,339
is one flight three plague radar 24 is

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:40,259
another and open sky is another one

00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:44,789
is an open research actually created by

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:46,799
three universities in Europe and so

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:50,059
hoping Skype they have all their data

00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:52,649
anybody who wants it can have a look and

00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:55,049
then I call this them their density

00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:57,209
church so there are a lot more airplanes

00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:59,399
flying around and you know if you live

00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:01,889
in a place that doesn't have docks over

00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,809
it you can get take care hard scale that

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,299
you suddenly got your bags this morning

00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:07,860
plug it into a Raspberry Pi and you can

00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:11,969
actually start this transmitting the

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:15,779
planes that we receive to those to these

00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:17,129
guys and the antenna that the lock

00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:22,199
everybody got a part of their badge

00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:24,209
actually works as a DSP antenna so why

00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,519
did where people with doing this it is a

00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:30,989
group safety they get a reduced amount

00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:33,809
of distance between aircrafts the more

00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:36,529
efficiency for users the big thing is

00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:41,759
regular stations to cost a lot of money

00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:44,009
a DSP cost lot less money and so the FAA

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,829
believes that between their savings and

00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,449
public's like their savings because

00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:53,489
things would fly closer together and

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:55,319
that we were closer routes the US alone

00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:56,219
will save about six billion dollars in

00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,029
the next 15 years

00:05:56,219 --> 00:06:01,349
yeah but they given back handed users is

00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:03,449
that the airplanes are going to be

00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,879
closer together I'm sure that's a super

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:09,119
awesome thing or not a good thing but

00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,069
the rule of thumb today is that planes

00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:14,069
have to be separated between thirty to

00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:16,259
eight miles and now they're going to 15

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,029
miles so you're basically going from a

00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,739
collision of every ten minutes because

00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:26,069
that once every two seconds been a thing

00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:29,219
to once every two minutes there's lots

00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:33,989
of open source maybe SP code actually

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:38,539
you know started 2010 by blimp the dump

00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:42,899
10 tiny to to different radio pieces to

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:46,830
implementation JavaScript Python and

00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:52,560
even TX and you know

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:58,140
in 2010 but this actually way a good way

00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:01,070
to get your picture with GQ magazine ad

00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:04,290
SP is actually quite easy so it's just a

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:10,230
pulse position modulation meaning that

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:11,970
we have either are going we have on one

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,890
by putting the pulses beginning to the

00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:18,330
bits or a zero by putting the pulse we

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:20,490
have a bit and the way that we we always

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,960
ensure we have a rising or a following

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,700
hedge on our Vic's pieces and so each

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,830
bit is one microsecond long and that

00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,760
pulse is half the back side we have a

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,920
preamble one one not because there's no

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,870
transition this is actually something

00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,940
that will never be seen in our message

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,920
and that's a great way that we can

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,840
actually use that to actually detect our

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,670
preamble versus something a little

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,710
domestic and then we have basically 56

00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:53,280
bits and 112 bits for long short

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,870
messages and what a lot of people do is

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,750
they basically sample these fit twice

00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,730
meeting once every half microsecond or

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,320
two mega samples a second and two mega

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,750
samples is super easy for her if you

00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,070
yell to do so a lot of this development

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:11,760
was done on parts of yellow raspberry

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:15,390
pi's x86 so when we want to our radio or

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,160
a DSP not we're obviously experts we

00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:20,970
have to decide what kind of receiver

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,980
quality metrics we need to look at so

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,500
that could be the number of good packets

00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,150
received or the number of bit errors or

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,470
CRC errors or a distance to the airplane

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,270
and when we talk about the number of

00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:37,820
good packets received or bit errors or

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:40,860
CRC nares from analog hardware or RF

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,260
physical layer guy those are all super

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,030
terrible members because you don't know

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:49,380
how many airplanes or you don't know how

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:51,210
many messages you've actually missed if

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,860
you don't detect the preamble or you can

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,900
get a CRC error get sort of a message

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,750
away and you can say okay while I got

00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,520
these many messages and but how many

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,600
preamble

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,190
this how many airplanes didn't you see

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:09,050
and usually I don't know I have s in

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:10,310
airplanes must be good and can be hard

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,110
to help community that's what a lot of

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:16,100
these guys are at because as I'll talk

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,570
about there's a few people kind of

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,420
looking at this from a real signal

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,710
processing kind of standpoint so one of

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,630
the other metrics a lot of people he was

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,270
as distance of the airplane and look

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:29,150
like one but that was second so you can

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,220
actually online say hey you know I am if

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:35,000
this specific latitude and longitude and

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,650
if an airplane is ten thousand feet in

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,500
the air this is where I should be able

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,300
to see it if it's 30,000 to 35,000 feet

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,060
in the air this is where I see it and

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,280
that's based on your your location and

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,950
the hills and obstructions in the way

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,760
between you the various airplanes but

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:55,130
this is also kind of meaningless because

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,010
like not every airplane will fly in

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,930
those things airplanes have plates they

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:02,480
they shuffle around but you know where I

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,300
live outside of Boston there's lots of

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,460
airplane licensing lots with a message

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,000
length of 112 microseconds per message

00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:15,380
in theory that allows up to almost 9,000

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,330
messages per second maximum and aircraft

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,890
can usually broadcast a little more than

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,170
once a second because they broadcast out

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:24,560
a different information

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:28,610
so they have like location is a data

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:32,000
type velocity vector is a data type my

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,260
toilet is clogged is a data type so all

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,350
of these different things are different

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,910
messages so airplanes will broadcast out

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,720
anywhere between five and ten messages a

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:43,610
second on the same aircraft and when I

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,380
look at the theoretical piece between

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,840
what I actually get in mind please

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:51,410
before I did any modifications you can

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,210
see it's much much smaller and if you

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,209
look at it you know there's various

00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,490
aircraft flying around but this is the

00:10:55,209 --> 00:11:01,119
since the maximum distances that April

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:05,379
you know it's still okay 125 kilometers

00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:06,670
away but varies day to day and the

00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,279
reason that varies day to day is

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:13,079
actually the weather and it's not

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,999
because at one point zero nine gigahertz

00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:17,829
changes with temperature its feed us

00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:19,749
when the winds blow the wrong way the

00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:21,189
m88 tells the airplanes that fly

00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:24,069
different directions they can't land on

00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:26,199
the other one way so you just don't see

00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:29,649
here it's because they're flying

00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:31,449
differently all the time the other issue

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,579
that I have is I have a bunch of trees

00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:36,670
around my house so even though my

00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:41,110
tenants like up in the roof it's still

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:43,300
not as tall as the as the trees are and

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,839
my wife live along the planet reduces

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:49,509
the antenna so but it is possible to get

00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,339
so this is a person from Europe they had

00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,600
the twelve hundred messages ascending

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:55,389
from one hundred thirty three different

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,220
aircraft and then this is decoded this

00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:58,779
on a standard receiver arts and LSD are

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,350
at this kind of thing so it's totally

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:04,209
possible duty spend others so the

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:09,069
quality metrics that I use was actually

00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:12,100
hi diagram so then with a constant in

00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:17,519
control transmitter so if we look at

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:20,829
three bits we see that there's always a

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,449
rising or falling edge in the middle so

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:24,610
here's our rising and falling edge in

00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:26,679
the middle we put all these together

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,240
overlap them we should see something

00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,459
that looks kind of something like this

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,529
and we want this middle piece to be as

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:35,889
open as it could be because that gives

00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:37,299
us a good guy so the first thing when

00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,850
you start building and receipt our

00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:43,509
receiver step number one is always know

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,819
the transmitter so that you can test

00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:47,860
your receiver and he will learn a lot

00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:50,319
about this signal by actually going and

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,889
transmitter and you know transmitters

00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:57,160
are actually much easier than receivers

00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:58,990
so you know to build a history or build

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,470
a bunch of samples we take our preamble

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:05,350
we have 96 random bits and at the

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,740
Paradiso their receivers action work and

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,770
we end up 200

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,450
it's to transmit this cohere and then we

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,550
just get see the mystery and we can see

00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,380
that you know we're transmitting like

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,420
zeros and ones that's what we build up

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:21,320
and that's what a lot of people go

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:26,360
though we don't transmit zeros and ones

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:29,510
the deck it transmits constant things

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:33,100
until it gets a change so what the DAC

00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:36,650
tries to do is transmit this square wave

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:42,950
and you know if we look at things

00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:45,080
spectrally we see you know DC value we

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:49,610
see it's pretty narrow band which is

00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:52,580
Greeks and we're minus 40 it actually

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,410
looks not terrible but these Peaks down

00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:59,480
here is like okay well minus 40 that's

00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:01,220
still kind of pretty high and if you

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,530
look at it wider you see this giant

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,210
lobes out here which is what we would

00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,940
actually be transmitting if we transmit

00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:11,840
it as a 2 mega sample kind of thing and

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:13,160
there's two mega sample samples and we

00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:18,680
don't want to do that because that's not

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:21,410
a great use of the spectrum and probably

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,410
violates the actual transmitter

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:27,830
documents that are 800 bucks each that I

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:30,320
too cheap to go viable but when we look

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:32,690
out even further like up to like 20

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,970
minutes we kind of see the same thing so

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,880
you know all these things well Elya is

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,770
unless we have some kind of filter and

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,500
when we look at the data that actually

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:44,390
counsel real radios we actually do see

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:49,520
the same information we can see these

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:50,840
big pieces here because it's just in

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,900
order to make those great square waves

00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,060
it's it's easier than actually transmit

00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:59,360
square waves through C square waves but

00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:02,750
spectrally it's super inefficient so

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,300
this is actually data from receivers

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,400
near the boss pair of words even it's

00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,270
super easy to decode this because on a

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,650
receiver it looks like a spare way but

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,060
spectrally it's probably clobbering over

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,980
top of other things that are supposed to

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,689
be there from so a practical

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,029
transmitters man

00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:24,730
we want to try and slow things down to

00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:25,899
actually consume less bamboo so one of

00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,299
the things we'll do the slow things down

00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:33,069
is instead of transmitting zero and one

00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:34,629
will transmit 0 1 0 and minus 1 because

00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:37,049
this is all about magnitude it's what

00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:39,670
these the amplitude of the signal and

00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:41,319
negative amplitudes are just as big when

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,720
you take the absolute value as positive

00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:47,230
amplitude and now we've just slowed this

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,110
signal down by half so every time we

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,819
want to make a transition we just flip

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,279
things unless there's two side by side

00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:56,439
when we keep it the same and so this

00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,559
waveform is actually much slower than

00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:02,999
the previous one and it actually becomes

00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:06,519
a little bit narrower but we still have

00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:08,980
these aliasing effects are these square

00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,569
wave effects infinite frequency because

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,410
we aren't actually transmitting square

00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:16,360
waves so the thing that we have to do is

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,480
we can't really transmit minus one and

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,899
one and the time domain so it needs an

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,879
up symbol filter and bandwidth limits so

00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:27,879
if we take our square wave and put it

00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,949
inside our device depending upon how

00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:33,279
that device is actually set up we can

00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:35,769
use the device to filter up sample and

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,919
bandwidth limit until we actually get a

00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:40,959
sample that looks like this and if we

00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:42,639
take the magnitude we can see here that

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,980
it actually matches up with rads B

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,899
signal it's not a problem and when we

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,639
look at the spectral pieces it's now

00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:53,739
minus 120 TV within 200 kilohertz so

00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,299
this is probably what you are doing to

00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:57,279
kind of get the signals to do things so

00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:59,199
we made our own transmitter it's off

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,139
pretty good so what's actually going on

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:06,939
here is we take our square wave we feed

00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:10,240
that into into our radio and we set this

00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:13,149
fir filter up here so that is actually a

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,829
low-pass filter around I think I have a

00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:21,490
cell for 700 colors and then we can

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:23,110
actually see some changing game of just

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,789
the filter that's to actually make up

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,299
for the droop of the half bands and the

00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:30,430
analog filters so now we have like I

00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,290
talked this morning we have a 2

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:38,320
coming in here at the time against the

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:41,200
DAX it's 96 and then we set up a 800

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,600
kilohertz filter here which means that

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,720
the signal bandwidth coming out is 1.6

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:51,180
May so the we could be the article that

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:56,050
says that a DSP is 50 colorants wide is

00:17:51,180 --> 00:18:00,340
not understanding than that and we see

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:02,980
that totally works so we get our signal

00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:06,100
like we can feed this into receiver and

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,240
it works fine but then what does it

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,570
really look like what does her eye

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,690
diagram look like so here's our nyan

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,270
diagram so this is basically this area

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,070
right here is just zoomed in here and we

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,900
can see that there is never anything

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,930
that kind of goes across the top and

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,270
there's a few signals that go across the

00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:27,430
bottom only because of those null

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:32,160
characters that we send during during

00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:34,360
the preamble so if we take that

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,980
previously filtered signal and put it

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,650
through here this is actually what we

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,140
see so we see it was 10 we're sampling

00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:45,490
right in the middle we could see a 1 and

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:50,530
a 0 and then because 0 or a 1 so that we

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:53,110
know with the symbol was a 1 or 0 and we

00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,360
could be a 1 and a 1 or a 0 and a 1 and

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,640
so you kind of changing but we never see

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,000
if then I go across the top and very few

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:04,140
times the bottom so what we think that

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,760
this is our one microsecond symbol and

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:11,170
what we're most interested in is how big

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:16,060
this is because we want this mine to be

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:18,400
as marked as we can so if we if these

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:21,820
eyes get small these red areas gets

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,420
bigger if we accidentally sample in the

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,950
wrong place you have no idea if you

00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,920
sample in the middle of this red diamond

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:32,770
if it's a 1 or 0 so you can't tell and

00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,690
you just miss that message because

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,340
you'll end up the same place every

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,560
single bit because there's always big

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,909
transitions there like I have no idea

00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,139
what this is I have no idea what this is

00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:47,199
a lady with this so when you're and this

00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:50,769
is Nyquist it's very difficult to take a

00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:53,440
to make a simple kind of information and

00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:55,690
simply have two big assemblies your

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,639
timing has to be exactly right or or

00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,159
closed and in this case you're probably

00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:02,199
like 70% of the time it'll work and

00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,199
that's kind of what we see when we go

00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:08,049
through the analysis so by changing the

00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:09,999
filtering on the transmitter you can go

00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:12,639
for nice big eyes where you don't end up

00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:16,209
with much problems to lots of problems

00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:18,519
and you can actually see how your

00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:20,469
receiver changes of this how good it is

00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:26,079
at decoding things are not decoding

00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:29,139
things so when I just kind of talk about

00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,969
where it is making a transmitter it'll

00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:36,279
tell you a lot about what we did you get

00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:37,629
the receiver and then them to take here

00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:42,099
so we've really been just talking about

00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:43,359
one signal and P to get an eye a lot of

00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:43,929
people with is like ooo let's throw in

00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,319
some recoveries

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:49,029
it'll be get Imagineering but later

00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:51,609
waves of the Hilbert's at the sample

00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:53,139
rate totally work very well together you

00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:54,849
need to have older sample data and these

00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:56,049
kind of things so you really can't

00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:58,299
connect because you'll get symbol

00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:00,459
smearing and everything now looks like

00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:02,139
it's all random in the same thing so

00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,579
you're really getting used over the

00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:07,989
easiest thing to do is just make eye is

00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:10,089
equal to Q and when I is equal to Q you

00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:14,769
just get to one point seven times on the

00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:17,049
earth and its works totally fine now so

00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:19,179
what does this all mean it's like you're

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:21,219
not just changing the inputs to the deck

00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:25,419
you're also setting up these furs these

00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:28,179
separates the are they had went to

00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:31,209
control your signal welcoming him put me

00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:32,289
on the output side and the key thing and

00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:35,259
you won't remember anything from this

00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:39,549
talk is if you are not explicitly

00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:42,459
setting them somebody else is it's

00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:46,869
either nei when we write the twice

00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:49,779
driver or Edison which E or it's not

00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:51,080
when they do the hack RF or it's the

00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:53,179
chip dying we made

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,789
because there's things that we just

00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:58,399
leave as the default and they need

00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:59,240
optimizing for a difference signal

00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:02,720
altogether

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,970
so like for example the 93 61 which is a

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,840
lot of these radios the chip was

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:10,940
optimized for healthy eat so a lot of

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,070
the settings for the chip at the default

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,610
even in the device driver are l.o.v.e

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:19,250
safe and there's not a lot of

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:23,929
commonality between a tsp and have

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:25,850
together so you want to try and make

00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:28,159
sure you do have controls of these kinds

00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:33,559
of things so you can optimize your word

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:35,330
system for your application so in terms

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:37,760
of optimizing the with license for the

00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,200
neediest Pete ones for sure one of the

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,330
first things we do is we just turn off

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,799
transmitter session so that actually

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,830
introduces some noise in the part that

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,630
makes the receiver a little bit better

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:50,210
so gain settings so on the receiver

00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:54,799
there's a manual automatic managing this

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:57,049
dynamic range so all these are great but

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,480
you can think we're trying to health em

00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:01,610
- tor pulse position modulation and

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,720
change and being able to be anywhere at

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:06,110
the middle of our message is going to

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,169
cause a problem so we basically have

00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:12,620
five microseconds detecting these four

00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:15,289
bits here to walk this game and then the

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,309
rest of it has to be like custom we're

00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,730
probably going to get a bit error

00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:21,649
somewhere so in the device itself

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,860
there's of annual moment there's a slow

00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:27,350
attack there's a fast attack so slow

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:31,429
attack is really for slowly changing

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:33,559
signals meaning in the words of tens or

00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:35,600
hundreds of microseconds a lot of this

00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:37,730
is actually determined by sample rate so

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,230
it'll need to see ten samples at a

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:42,799
certain level before it actually changes

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:45,529
values which is not what we have a DSP

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,789
then there's fast attack - antenna ones

00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:51,440
- results

00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:56,100
both of these AGC settings are based on

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:59,129
managing average power so average memory

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:02,879
in DSP signal is much difference of

00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:04,769
average power in a co FDM signal so when

00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:07,159
we talk about managing average power

00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:10,289
what do we want the average power to be

00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,359
so we simply average power you know let

00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:13,739
the M single to minus 12 DB that's what

00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,749
the average power wants to be in the

00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:17,700
children and that gives us a group of

00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:20,489
the chip for the peak to average ratio

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,649
so that we don't ever exceed full-scale

00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:27,720
and it's kept nice in the linear region

00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:30,090
and 4 QPSK or other modulation schemes

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,190
that average power ratio is much

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:35,399
different

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:39,570
so we REM radio for example so this is a

00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:42,210
picture of SDR angel with slow attack

00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:44,460
send to the default which is OFDM

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,139
because it was for healthy heat and we

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,659
can see we're basically giving up two

00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:51,330
bits of information in our system

00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:53,659
because we're expending that average

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:56,549
power ratio would be minus 12 DB and

00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,019
just by changing this targets we

00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,690
actually get much better dynamic range

00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:06,960
and a much better signal going into the

00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:08,789
system so one of the interesting things

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,619
about dump denying has been around a

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:17,820
long time is dump 1090 has been forts

00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:19,590
879 three times works are all over the

00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,440
place there's lots of people working on

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:26,970
them the guy hitting this one which is

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:30,690
great took the work that was Thunder RTL

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:34,559
which is a big device and then we have

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:36,539
12 bits coming in and all the coding in

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,889
for the RTL was all painted so it's like

00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:43,139
okay well Oh awesome four LS B's and

00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:46,859
it'll all be good so you know on the

00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:49,739
Pluto device we have 12 bits we put that

00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:52,260
into a 16 bit container and then he goes

00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:55,260
and blocks off the core so this is what

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:58,590
yes but he didn't change the AGC

00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,670
settings at all so he has there's two

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,040
bits that are sitting at the top

00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:05,580
expected - how could he have heard our

00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:08,670
community so he's basically made turned

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,170
over to a 650 place so many when people

00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,520
say like oh you know he'd like Pluto

00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,290
doesn't work as good as my heart - gal

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,380
was like dude your software's all messed

00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:18,600
up and it's good that person who did

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,030
this is dumber doesn't understand all

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,150
the stuff is hard it's like super

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:26,280
specific to the hardware he kind of have

00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:29,670
to be an expert on all things trying to

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,860
his benefit and it's difficult so you

00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,210
know he took his pieces and the pieces

00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,190
that we were working for art's yellow

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,570
and put Bluto in there he had him

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,150
working he had a team building airplanes

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:44,970
it totally works but how many airplanes

00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:48,050
do you miss and the energy loss so the

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,970
other one because another person took

00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:53,280
this you know he puts it in slowdown

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,110
mode which just means maximum gain

00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:00,420
because the system will never be able to

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:02,730
respond faster so in the game tables of

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,220
the device there's all these set of

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,350
incentives from elevated to gain in the

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,960
LMA to gain in the mixer to beat them to

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:14,400
gain to gain in the analog filters to

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:16,110
digital game and we basically fill up

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,880
this table that depending upon what's

00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,500
happening in the system with your

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,450
average power level maybe there just

00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:26,250
move up right now in this table and then

00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,040
you have these detectors need to text

00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:34,380
the LMT which is this LM a mixer TIAA

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:37,380
and then a tcp low power digital

00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:41,000
saturation so we measured things in the

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:44,430
analog domain in like microseconds

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,560
milliseconds things in the ATC domain in

00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:48,660
the digital domain based on sample rates

00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,490
and all of these kinds of things trying

00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,440
to figure out what's going on to have

00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,870
set these things up and as you can

00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,990
imagine there are too many settings to

00:27:54,870 --> 00:28:00,450
try and optimize my hand so you know

00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:02,390
when somebody says hey I have this

00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,620
signal Trent Haaga my speech

00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,990
see you know he's like good luck and

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:11,020
that was not a super compelling

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:15,920
comforting answer for most people so

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:19,970
what we did because we work on a system

00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:22,310
level simulation and we can generate

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,740
waveforms we have the receiver model we

00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:27,470
have all the HEC control logic we can

00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:30,230
actually put him in a DSP receiver so

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:33,200
that we can actually from like on Monte

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:35,330
Carlo or search kind of approach throw

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,570
in as many different combinations and

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:40,790
permutations as we want change every

00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:44,450
single setting and figure out basically

00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:46,520
which stellate works best and so you

00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,550
know the answer now is like hey run this

00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,530
simulation it takes two days but at the

00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,720
end you'll actually get an answer they

00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:56,830
go you have no problem two days of going

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,180
and coming back into Monday sounds great

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,100
so that's basically what it does you

00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:05,390
have your waveforms you put through some

00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:08,860
MATLAB pieces and you can actually get

00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:11,330
the answers out to help to your HEC and

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,920
there's some visualization pieces to

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,020
help monitor like okay well that when I

00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,680
change this what does this actually do

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:20,480
to my eye diagram what does it do to my

00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,830
CRC hairs what does it do to these kind

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,540
of things which kind of a big data

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:28,520
visualization piece and we have this

00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:32,390
discussion internally is it really Monte

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,670
Carlo or is it just a giant for loop and

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:38,470
it's like oh well some guys in Venus

00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:40,820
Monte Carlo is a giant poor little baby

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,800
but that that meant you can take your

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,280
results from your simulation and put

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,710
them right into the place and get some

00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,630
actually settings these kinds of things

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,610
so you ever see her a GC can actually be

00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,490
optimized right now and then you know

00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,530
the FIR filters the analog filters these

00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,240
kind of things which doesn't need to be

00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,280
the same of the text that's totally

00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,500
independent and usually on a receiver

00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,450
you actually want to keep that as wide

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,580
open doesn't make sense because if

00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:11,090
somebody is sending you a square wave

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,350
it's easier to decode and so you don't

00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,490
want to make that as narrow as you can

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,500
unless you're you know

00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:19,010
a channeler happen piece of cane or

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:21,410
walker or or something like that

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:24,800
the other thing that we did our process

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,179
of doing is actually instead of coming

00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,970
out at two biggest samples a second

00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:31,570
coming in club and have the fpga and

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:34,990
actually determined based on correlators

00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:37,820
which is the best pace looked at and

00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:40,670
then we can either down sample that line

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,650
we're down sample by 6 to get to or 2.4

00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,720
mega samples a second and then that

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,090
actually goes into the armor so we've

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,860
actually done this for you know to 11 as

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,600
well where we actually look for the

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,690
beacon frame receiver path 20 mega

00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,590
samples second on the fpga on though and

00:30:53,690 --> 00:31:00,260
then when we see it then we send samples

00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:02,450
that way you don't the burden of the USB

00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,860
to doesn't limit your overhead because

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:08,570
you know you're actually sending good

00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:11,990
data across the you guys be linked and

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:14,870
then becomes optimizing the algorithm so

00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:18,200
you know when we look at this because we

00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:21,860
pup sample dislike 48 as 14 different

00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,929
faces can actually look at so i can

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,390
extract the data from here make data

00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:27,860
files 48 different data files for the

00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,110
same thing and then pass that into LAN

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:34,820
receiver and have it emulate to vegas

00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:36,620
nettles ii or 40 different phases 2.4

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:41,120
and the reason i talked about 2.4 make a

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:42,860
sample ii was one mother's work the duct

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,320
in nineteen then should include the

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,630
sample rate to 2.4 so they get six

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,309
samples for five symbols and they use a

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,350
correlation technique actually just

00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:53,300
extract things and that's why they're

00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,970
actually able to receive more airplanes

00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,760
and the other forks would still sample a

00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:00,230
2 because they're not if something winds

00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:05,330
up wrong because the line up long for

00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:07,840
every single bit testing dumping 10 90s

00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:13,670
super easy it does just take files

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:17,330
either sine 1619 there is a canary 80s

00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:18,860
deep but at the launch them it still is

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:24,330
two mega samples percent

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:27,240
they open the same way and then there's

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,860
optimizing the receipt better so this is

00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,990
this is my favorite this is actually an

00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:34,650
FAA certified ats-v antenna

00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:39,240
I think it's $600 but it's certifying

00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:42,120
for 350 miles an hour at 50,000 feet

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:47,250
this is do-it-yourself one from play 24

00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:50,360
is is not certified and but there are

00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:53,610
ones on Amazon that are super reasonable

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,640
the other piece is the Play Doh air like

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:59,580
filters so lightly ran actually make a

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,660
filter specifically for a DSP that's I

00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:05,580
use right here and you know it has what

00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,740
shows up on the Amazon page we buy it

00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,210
this is this picture here and one here

00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,580
really interested in is this picture

00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:17,460
here which goes out much further so I

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:17,910
think this goes out to something like

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,290
that

00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:24,450
he was like Jim Jim we want to be able

00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:26,850
to see what it is at that third harmonic

00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,549
of the yellow because that's actually

00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:33,150
the most significant servo and then

00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:36,750
there's another one this is an LMA plus

00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:38,370
filter and this is great but the only

00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:42,780
specification of the Amazon Web page

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:44,280
this is the picture so you can look at

00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,650
it is legal it's actually pretty good so

00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,450
if you man it looks pretty awesome but

00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,820
they found a band there's actually

00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,590
positive gain on the third harmonic of

00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,110
the yellow which standing for City

00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:57,570
single there is good healing aspect and

00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:00,000
you'll actually see that repositories

00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,410
and bereavement problems so what I ended

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,890
up doing is I achieved is use them both

00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:09,270
together and it's the power of ham as

00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:13,080
Mike last time so we have our 30

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:15,330
megahertz kind of weight our filter and

00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:19,260
then at that third harmonic you're down

00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:22,080
20 or 30 DB which is great and then

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,119
there's that forgot you piece so we

00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,510
figured out our signal processing done

00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,669
that they did sign elaboration piece got

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:32,269
our algorithms running

00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:34,369
test against make sure work and then

00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:36,559
what we I did is I just crossed the

00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:39,109
piled up tonight even arm and I run it

00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:42,379
directly on the note and I feed that to

00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:47,149
open the sky directly on so I just plug

00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:49,460
him a HEPA dense USB dongle and my home

00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:52,010
network and it just runs and shoots data

00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,440
that wooden stuff and then just created

00:34:52,010 --> 00:35:01,130
a small CGI shell stripper turn it on

00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:03,940
off so if things are so this isn't

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,839
actually running from the device itself

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,279
there's a little bet server that

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:11,059
actually runs here and it goes to open

00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:15,049
maps and this is just grabbing data from

00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:22,069
this antenna oh yeah okay sorry

00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:24,410
thank you okay so yeah anybody wants to

00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:27,619
come see the demo I guess the let us set

00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:29,269
up the booth but the things that are

00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:31,220
left to do is simply just upstream to

00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:33,680
make the fur part public and then just

00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:37,029
add more modern communications DSP to

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,839
decode the outputs at higher rates and

00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:40,609
one of the things I didn't actually

00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:44,559
point down here is that is actually a

00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:46,700
tray table in the airplane it's not

00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:50,299
taking radios on airplanes or not

00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,710
against any issue that I'm aware the TSA

00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:53,900
actually has something on their website

00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:56,630
that says radios our home anything on

00:35:53,900 --> 00:36:02,200
airplanes as long as you don't transmit

00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:02,200
to the wrong times especially transmit

00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:11,720
don't transfer so things you would need

00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:14,630
to transmit ESP would be just like you

00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:20,650
know a little pipe on and desire to go

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:20,650
to jail for a long time but yeah

00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:29,460
airplanes not sure if they up this is

00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:31,620
mine but I do know the time when solo

00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,900
booking how REO for all communications

00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,060
are all about that weakest link and that

00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,420
weakest link in the hardware and get the

00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:42,660
algorithm and it's can't optimize the

00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,520
hunger if your hardware setup isn't

00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:49,620
actually configured for the signals the

00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:52,310
Earth's restive and with that first

00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,310
novel two bits
