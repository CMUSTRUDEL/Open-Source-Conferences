Description: 
	VLBI with GNU Radio and White Rabbit by Paul Boven

Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is a technique in radio astronomy that allows for unprecedented resolution by phasing up participating radio telescopes all over the world. This phasing up requires very stable atomic clocks at each observatory, in order to coherently combine the signals. The Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC (JIVE) in Dwingeloo, the Netherlands processes the data for the European VLBI Network (EVN). As part of the European ‘ASTERICS’ research project, we have contributed to investigations on the suitability of the open ‘White Rabbit’ standard for the distribution of highly stable time and frequency reference signals.

CAMRAS (C.A. Muller Radio Astronomy Station) operates the historic 25m Dwingeloo Radio telescope in the Netherlands. Once the largest fully steerable radio telescope in the world, it is now retired and run by volunteers. We increasingly use SDRs and GNU Radio for our astronomical and other observations.

In this presentation we will show how, with some improvements, the White Rabbit system can be used as a reference for VLBI, even at 169km link distance. Timestamping and recording the broadband data at the Dwingeloo telescope was done with an USRP, using a GNU Radio flowchart.

	00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:21,710
hi my name is Paul Bhavan and I'll talk

00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,960
about VLBI with denier rabbits are now a

00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,360
few I with good start you'll be high

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,420
with no radio and what rabbit no radio

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:33,950
you'll know what rabbit you have maybe

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,270
heard a little bit about I work at the

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,120
joint institute for a field behind

00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,430
Europe called jive and in my spare time

00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,610
I also do a lot of radio astronomy on

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:47,300
this dish here the 25 meter doing a lot

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:50,149
- that you might have heard of before so

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,370
a little bit of an introduction why are

00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:56,269
we doing this field we high stuff if you

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,850
take like the Hubble Space Telescope say

00:00:56,269 --> 00:01:02,030
at 600 nanometer wavelength and the size

00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,400
of 2.4 meters diameter if you can easily

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,560
it's just a ratio calculate that the

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,270
resolution that you can get out of it is

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,580
like 0.06 arc second where you after you

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,380
look 60 degrees gets divided in minutes

00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,110
gets divided in arc seconds and this is

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,240
a fraction of an arc second now if you

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,180
take it 25 meter telescope so that's 10

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,300
times bigger but you're have a

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,190
wavelength to the order of 6 centimeter

00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,170
your resolution is in like ten thousand

00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,940
times worse actually with this kind of

00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,330
resolution you would have like four or

00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,580
five pixels of the full moon so to get

00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,590
an equivalent resolution to see the

00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,360
things in a radio spectrum that you also

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,340
want to see in the optical or that you

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,300
can already see in the optical you would

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,980
actually need a dish of 250 kilometres

00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,880
yeah right which we don't have

00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:55,340
apparently so the solution to this has

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,440
been found is called very long baseline

00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,140
interferometry so that's what the VLBI

00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,430
stands for it is connecting radio

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:07,010
telescopes all over the world and using

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:11,540
them in face as a giant I would always

00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:14,510
say my mower right this chart shows the

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,010
European VLBI Network it's not like the

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,900
United States for instance doesn't have

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,239
any radio telescopes they have a great

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,099
deal bi network of of their own but I

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,610
work for John if and we do this Joint

00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:29,080
Institute for VLBI in Europe and we run

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,080
the European VLBI networks

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:37,010
so what can you do with vo-vi you can

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:39,080
get unprecedented resolution the image

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,710
left has already been shown that is the

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,820
black hole in m87 and resolution there

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:49,670
is really micro arcsecond the image to

00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,170
the right is actually a very interesting

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,540
image you have like a radio source

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,440
that's eleven point seven billion

00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,540
light-years away

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,550
and in between the radio source and this

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,340
is a cluster of galaxies that's much

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,650
closer and the radio signal is actually

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,680
being bent around this cluster by

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,540
gravity and that gives rise to this ring

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,460
shaped structure called an Einstein ring

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,360
and the people who made this image were

00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:16,130
actually able to deduce the like mass

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,070
distribution in the in the galaxies and

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,750
also details about the very far away

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,360
source that you could not possibly see

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,920
itself so if VLBI does not yet give you

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,350
in a resolution you can get more

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,600
magnification if it happens to line up

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:33,050
with some very heavy block galaxy

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,290
cluster for instance so what do you need

00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:39,020
you need a field VI in a nutshell a

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,030
virtual radius telescope where like the

00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,790
diameter is comparable to the largest

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,770
distance between two dishes a resolution

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,780
you get is on the order of a milli arc

00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,760
seconds or even better sometimes

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,520
so all these telescopes look at the same

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,930
source at the same time before you

00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,239
actually process the dates are

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,220
correlated together because the earth is

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,280
rotating and if you were at the crater

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,830
year you'd actually be rotating at 456

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,950
meters per second so all the Doppler

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,360
shift and all the delays to all the

00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,980
different telescopes from the directory

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,670
that you're viewing in they need to be

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,530
taken out then you calculate the complex

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,540
cross correlation on each of the

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,090
baseline so from each telescope to each

00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,870
of the other ones and you fill this in

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,970
in a circles

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,730
UV plane where you have basically the

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,340
wavelength as the two axis and then if

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,620
you do a Fourier transform of this you

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,410
actually get an image except it's a very

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,700
poor image because most of these UV

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,289
plane is empty

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,479
because you didn't have a telescope at

00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:40,210
that particular distance so you have to

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,160
guess what the data

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,050
would have been like and for that reason

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,740
there are very very complicated

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:50,979
algorithms to them make a very clean and

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,660
nice image so what you need is first of

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:54,430
all already a telescope and not just one

00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,770
you need multiple because otherwise you

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,440
can't do interferometry as many as you

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,449
can as big as you can of course each of

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,190
those needs a very stable frequency

00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:06,190
source because you want all those faces

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,660
and observing frequencies of say 10

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,479
gigahertz you want the faces to be

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:13,570
stable to each other within a thousand

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,430
seconds and you can't really do that

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,460
over piece of coax that you run from

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,990
here to Germany you need a lot of

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,639
bandwidth because the more bandwidth we

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,650
have the more sensitivity yet we have

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,320
been through it actually scares as the

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,479
or sensitivity scales as the square root

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,180
of the bandwidth you need a

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,130
supercomputer to do all the processing

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,169
as comes with this and then you need a

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,419
lot of detailed work like you need very

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,220
accurate telescope locations which

00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:41,740
actually take into account effect that

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,360
not only just to see go up and down with

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,970
the tide but actually the earth before

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,500
us by up to 40 centimeters you know no

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,360
you don't notice because everything

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,180
around you're just the same but it goes

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,010
up quite a bit and down again all these

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,740
state details do you need to take care

00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,210
of so for the rest of the talk I'm sort

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,840
of going down this list of things you

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,000
need and see what I can find

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,800
so we start with a radio telescope so in

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,800
my spare time and a volunteer at the

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,630
doing local radio telescope it's it's a

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,550
very ancient instrument at one time it

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,259
was the largest fully radio fully

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,940
steerable radio telescope in the world

00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:21,039
it's a 25 meter diameter dish and it

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:25,690
nowadays is being run by volunteers of

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,220
the cameras foundation first of all

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,620
maintenance try and keep the instrument

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,190
in order we do radio astronomy we do ham

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,289
radio things like moon bounce we do

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,389
education and outreach we do SETI we do

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,590
satellites you certainly might have

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,090
heard of some of our satellite

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,400
observations that we've recently done

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,070
and then art projects and many other

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,219
activities on the left you see the

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:51,010
official opening in 1956 by queen

00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:53,110
juliana of nellams and i couldn't resist

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:56,020
this this is yesterday is

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,060
actually our queen and our king and in

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,220
between those two two of our volunteers

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,480
today visited yesterday and what you see

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,630
on the right hand is what we showed them

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,660
is a new radio plot of in real time of

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:11,830
the Galactic hydrogen hydrogen line at

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:15,280
21 centimeters I think there's more

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,600
Royalists here okay so a little bit more

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,990
about the technical details because that

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:23,040
we're here for for white mint observe

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,540
them like feel bi like I said

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,490
sensitivity scales were scurried out of

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,770
the bandwidth and now you always run

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,200
into financial limits the amount of disk

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,730
space you have the amount of network

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,710
throughput you have to get somewhere and

00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,950
then to get the best sensitivity out of

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,720
it you want to use fewer bits if you can

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,130
represent your data with fewer bits you

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,190
can actually put more bandwidth into

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:48,010
your link but your quantization noise

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:50,350
gets worse so that is a trade-off and

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,240
for VLBI actually we almost always use

00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,520
two bit quantization are only two bit I

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,590
know great Scot yesterday said they do

00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,460
it with one bits we do two bit front

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:03,190
ization only a two bit quantization

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:06,970
should not be difficult it's simply you

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:10,240
you left gift you your values until you

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,500
have two bits turns out that actually it

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,660
is a little bit bit difficult there's

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,100
two kinds of conversation there's the C

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,560
style truncation where everything

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,710
between minus 1 and plus 1 actually gets

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,810
rounded to 0 but a signal processing we

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,870
won't work like anything between minus

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,370
1/2 and bustle have to run down to 0

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,830
because otherwise you get like a huge

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,830
discontinue discontinuity in your

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:36,820
running function the nice thing is that

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:39,490
new radio will do both what you see here

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:43,930
is a graph of all the values that round

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,670
to 0 and nicely as expected values

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:49,570
between minus 1/2 and plus and Hall

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:52,180
they're round to 0 except every 8,192

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,310
samples occasionally you get a much

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:58,960
larger range that raster's here and the

00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:01,930
reason for this is that most of the code

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,510
is optimized to the truth folk library

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,910
and it uses SSE in this case and just

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,160
the right thing but there's a little

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,250
few leftover samples that actually get

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,170
processed in C in the same block and at

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,090
the C style sampling as he style

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,700
rounding and you get this effect and

00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:20,260
apparently nobody's had them had looked

00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,140
at these in detail before so this is the

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,470
first time I kind of got involved as a

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,750
contributor to the radio project saying

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:34,000
that's right fortunately it's been fixed

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:35,860
now another challenge was high bit

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,240
recording and I'm telling you here how

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,610
we did it but maybe there are people

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,930
here who have better solutions and I

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,870
would love to hear it

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:46,510
we had a extra ten with the two with two

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,220
twin rx modules and at worst you can get

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,840
or maybe I should say at best you can

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,820
get twelve point eight gigabit per

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,170
second out of that and of course if you

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,510
have an expensive as the you are like

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,250
this with expensive models etc you want

00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,850
to actually capture the data and that's

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,100
not trivial

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,830
I could easily record to memory on my

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,880
machines but here you run out of memory

00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,760
very quickly

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,940
I had the server that has like 36 disks

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:14,140
Lost's 18 discs that I was made a raid 0

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:16,510
out of it and even with UHD you can't

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,580
really do any sensible benefit GG start

00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,620
losing packets and because we are very

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,000
sensitive to the phase of the whole

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
thing as soon as we lose packets we're

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,600
gone

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,640
so then I found spec req spectrum

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,400
recorder which is part of the gr

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,050
analysis and that there's something a

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,910
little bit more sense sensible where you

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,860
have like a large ring buffer of memory

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,720
that the thing records in and at the

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,790
same time writes to disk it doesn't wait

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,220
for it all to be filled and then write

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,860
it yes because then it's so busy writing

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,840
to this tell it contacting examples and

00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,510
with that at least at 50 mega samples

00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,060
per second on just one port it would

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:55,480
keep up for hours sometimes awful not

00:10:52,060 --> 00:11:01,450
anyway if there people have better ways

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:04,180
of recording this let me know the

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,980
timestamp is also really important

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,420
if you cross correlating this data you

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,310
need to have a time reference and all

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,900
your data so you are actually cost

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,200
correlating data from the same point in

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:17,050
time and the radio has some facilities

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,649
for it many years of peace they have

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,559
like a GPS clock

00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:25,680
and you can start your flow graph and

00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,509
sync it to GPS but GPS is not nearly

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,819
good enough in the timing for what we

00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:33,480
need and especially not in the frequency

00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:34,589
reference in the interface stability so

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,170
one of the things I did and this is

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:39,240
actually documented in the ettus

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,220
knowledgebase how you should do this and

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,040
it is just unfortunate that every time I

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,499
write a blog every time I write a flow

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,230
graph I need to add this in by hand so

00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:51,720
you wait for the PPSh then you look at

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,459
your PC what time is it now or actually

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,839
you wait for the PBS you wait a little

00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:58,350
bit so that you're sure you're in the

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,699
middle of the next second and then you

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,709
read out your PC time which is

00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:04,740
presumably locked to NTP and then you

00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:07,290
set that time you tell you is be at the

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,730
next rising edge of the PPS that is

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,550
going to be your time and that actually

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,929
works it just takes more than a second

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,230
to do the synchronization but that's not

00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:19,110
an issue so one of the things I hope to

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:23,429
contribute is to actually make this part

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:26,249
of you HD again so now we get to the

00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:28,649
actual new radio part the data that we

00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:29,519
process in the OPI is usually done in

00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,160
Saban's

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,410
and the standards that we use say you

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,050
use 16 megahertz appends so I have a

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,509
twin Oryx which is sampled at 100 mega

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,459
samples per second so the recorded data

00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,649
comes in here as shorts which are

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:47,100
turning to floats and then the first

00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:48,959
thing I do is resample it from 100 mega

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,029
sample per second to only 80 because

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,970
there's only 80 makers of spectrum in it

00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:56,339
anyway so that test block and then I go

00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:00,660
to a polyphase filter Bank so I create

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:03,420
five channels and this multiplier and

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,670
this source they actually shift the

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,679
channels with like half a channel the

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,990
idea is that the band edges which I

00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,689
can't juice end up in the same polyphase

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,720
channel and they go into there's no sync

00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:19,610
we throw away all the other channels we

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:22,350
do the same thing for x which is we

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,119
double the sample rate we shift the

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,249
spectrum up and then we throw away the

00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:28,709
imaginary part which is actually the

00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:30,720
same thing as going from complex to real

00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:32,430
values we've gone from complex to single

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,700
sideband upper sideband

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,790
and then we read them out in order in a

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,950
particular block size and then over here

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,930
their floats over here we go to a bit

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,600
representation they should have only

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,220
been won't walk but due to the book I

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,290
mentioned earlier I'm actually doing it

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,360
in two steps over here I'll bring it

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,100
down to eight bits and then here I have

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,360
a lookup table to go from eight bits to

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,760
two bits this is a homegrown block a new

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,530
grm block that actually pushed the time

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,630
stamps on it and the name of the order

00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,910
the designation of the telescope and

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,910
which frequencies etc and that makes it

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:12,240
standard VLBI data format so that's why

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:14,040
it's called the book finally we write it

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,170
to file and then we can put it in to do

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,610
correlator and the correlator will

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,730
compare it to all the channels for all

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,830
the other telescopes and get our image

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,770
now using this flow chart and we're now

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,750
last year August we actually did our

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,730
first field VI observation with the

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,610
radio telescope except it wasn't the

00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,410
first his telescope did in 1978 they had

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,910
they borrowed a rubidium clock somewhere

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:43,050
and we did the same thing we borrow

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:44,910
rubidium clock and we Russ correlated

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,030
between the Westerberg telescope and

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:50,600
England's Arduino telescope and the Jodl

00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:54,810
bank mark - radio telescope in the UK

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,550
and what you see here is time slots and

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,870
the cross-correlation in each of these

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,180
time slots and you see that there's only

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,030
one peak which is nicely in the centre

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,710
which shows that is actually works

00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,080
except at that time we could only record

00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,670
to memory and we could only record ten

00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:13,830
seconds at the time was that was good

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:16,380
enough to show that this works so this

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,660
whole hobby half work and for work we

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:22,080
got involved in a project called Asterix

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:25,980
which is a European Commission horizon

00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:28,910
2020 project and its aim was to address

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,680
all kinds of interdisciplinary issues in

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:35,610
astronomy astroparticle physics particle

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,500
physics etc and one of the fields that

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,450
all of these Institute's all these

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,970
observatories and experiments suffer

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,100
with is accurate timing and why brevity

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,779
is a very interesting way to do it there

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,160
were lots of vibrant work back

00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:52,560
in the industry search and we were going

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,660
to work with this as well we were going

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,430
to show that what Revit as a time of

00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:01,499
frequency reference distribution is good

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:04,819
enough as a time source for for VLBI so

00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:07,050
almost as good as a hydrogen maser clock

00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:08,430
so not everyone here is familiar but

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,649
white rabbit on the left you have a

00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:14,459
white rabbit switch then you have like

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:16,290
optics and this is not your normal fiber

00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,970
optic stuff this is only one optical

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,309
board because you're using the same

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,949
fiber back and forth in the same rate

00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:24,899
same direct as right back back and forth

00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:27,870
on the same fiber you do it at different

00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,850
wavelengths though and and that's why it

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,379
has only one fiber connected instead of

00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,389
them to normal pair connection you would

00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:34,680
have so you go through a fiber and at

00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:36,689
the other end you have another block

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,279
another optical converter and you have

00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:40,949
your end point and that gives you out

00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,980
your pulse per seconds and your turn

00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:45,720
megahertz again and it's completely

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:49,050
compensates for the unknown and changing

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,350
delay through the fiber and it does this

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:56,550
by measuring the round-trip time to Pico

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:59,699
second accuracy so our work package we

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,199
put some interesting challenges so here

00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,509
you have two Westerberg telescope that

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,039
already showed their hydrogen maser this

00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:08,159
is a white rabbit switch and from there

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,010
we could go 67 kilometres to the north

00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:12,750
to the city of honing in where we did

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,120
optical amplification and went back to

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,549
the same place we came from and then

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,740
more optical amplification and then we

00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:22,470
would get over 35 kilometres of dark

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,659
fiber to our rainy telescope in doing

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,610
hello now the interesting thing here is

00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:28,260
that we were able to do this over an

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,480
existing public dense

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,120
wavelength-division multiplexing network

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,299
so we didn't have to run our own fibers

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,309
we didn't have to interrupt the existing

00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,470
users of this network with the trends we

00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:41,940
used allowed us to insert these

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,580
wavelengths outside of the existing

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,470
wavelengths to add our own amplifiers

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,750
because what Revit only one works on a

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,270
single fiber so your amplifiers actually

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,830
need to be bi-directional which is very

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,649
unusual in telecommunication industry

00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,419
and actually raised a few eyebrows when

00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:59,580
we first discussed it with them but

00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,120
fortunately the Dutch research and

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,400
education

00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,410
word providers sir that was very willing

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,740
and interested in helping with this and

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,090
we managed to set up this link and for

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,010
the people who are actually into

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:14,130
synchronization this is the Ellen

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,890
deviation that we got where the red line

00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,350
and the Green Line for red and the blue

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:24,330
line continuing to one its order give us

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:27,330
the the actual shift stability of the

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,800
clock and in black we have the

00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,180
performance that hydrogen weighs or

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,400
would have according to the sales

00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,080
brochure so as you can see everywhere

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,940
we're like we didn't an order of

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,340
magnitude of the same stability and at

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,280
over a thousand seconds eventually we

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,740
cross over and even better unfortunately

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,090
that's arranged where for V OPI it's not

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,680
that interesting anymore but we were

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:51,270
like within an order of magnitude of

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:53,940
what you can do with hydrogen maser the

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,680
problem we had is that the radio

00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,270
telescope in doing low is still like

00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,860
trailing meters away from the building

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:03,390
so then we had to put in some fiber and

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,600
like I said this is Hall hobby how

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:09,120
worked this was definitely hobby part so

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,120
somebody was kind enough to give us 500

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,180
meters of fiber the only problem is it

00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:20,310
is hundreds of 44 strands so a little

00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:26,790
bit and we started we have to go from

00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:29,550
here so we rented the digger that's some

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,160
fiber or some tubing then we inserted

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:35,250
the fiber and build assistance so that

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,750
fiber can actually rotate around the

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,420
axis of the telescope so it doesn't get

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:43,650
kinked as we turned the whole building

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:46,520
which turns with the dish now we also

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:49,410
ended up splicing our own fiber which is

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,600
this is each fiber here is like an

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:55,080
eighth of a millimeter in size it's

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,420
really nerve-wracking work to do and

00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,220
what we ended up in the end is what we

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,410
ended up with in the end in the inside

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,840
the Faraday cage inside the radio

00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,640
telescope is this centered so you might

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,950
recognize some of these books this is an

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,420
external antenna and I managed to find

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,120
an extra hundred somewhere else so we

00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,030
have two over this is the incoming fiber

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,950
and so we had this

00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,260
169 kilometer and we also had to direct

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,080
35 kilowatt Srilanka so we could

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,790
actually compare the performance and

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,160
this is what rabbits reach that takes

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,560
care of so timing and this is second

00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,180
rabbit switch so we could run one on the

00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,530
long link and the other on the short

00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,530
link and run them at the same time

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,330
actually these are not I should also

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,860
mention that these are not the standard

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,360
white rabbit switches she don't get this

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,900
kind of performance on the standard y

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,190
brackets which we used an extension to

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,650
the white rabbit switch which is called

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,210
the load jitter daughterboard and on one

00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,540
of the switches we also had a special

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,400
cleaner oscillator and that allowed us

00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:00,600
to actually get to the performance that

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,090
we were achieving so now it's time to

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,250
show that all of this actually work and

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,230
unfortunately the project was getting

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,590
very much edits and it ended in April

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:13,320
this year and by now we are in March so

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,480
it's getting a bit tight but in March we

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,060
had a overall network monitoring

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,890
experiment with like 20 dishes

00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:22,680
officially participating and we only

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:25,080
officially participated with our hobby

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,840
dish as well problem is all these

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,140
observations vo-vi observations at 21

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,850
centimeters are at 18 centimeter wave

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,590
line sixteen hundred and fifty megahertz

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,080
which is slightly higher than the

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,810
hydrogen line and the very low that they

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,580
she didn't have any receivers for that

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,830
so we had to install new low-noise

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,140
amplifiers which means you have to get

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,180
into the elevator the elevator goes up

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,560
and then you go to the receiver and then

00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,740
you can pull out the receiver to bring

00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:56,060
it down with you it's a lovely picture

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:59,430
except we have wind for six and rain

00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:01,380
yeah still we mentioned to do this and

00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,230
we managed to get our first fringes on a

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,810
remote macer and what you see here is

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,190
again the amount of cross correlation

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,440
for different time offsets and you see

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,230
one very nice peak and this is actually

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:17,430
between the Divini load ish and the 100

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:20,150
meter diameter F osburgh dish also

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:22,310
because we lost minute bought different

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,590
preamplifiers we didn't quite have the

00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:29,010
sensitivity that we thought we had but

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:31,860
later on I did more observations and

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:33,870
what you see here in black is the actual

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,890
performance of the link back to back

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,660
without doing VLBI and then yes again is

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,730
an Ellen deviation so over here you see

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,390
the amount of frequency noise and what

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:47,070
you see over here is your averaging time

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:50,429
what you see here is that for 35

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,890
kilometer and for that 169 kilometer the

00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:55,289
performance is exactly the same but that

00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,850
eventually it starts to diverge and that

00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:59,070
is because these measurements were not

00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:02,090
done at the same time yet and you start

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:05,010
to see the effects of the ionosphere

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,440
still we can see that the performance is

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:10,580
so pretty close to the link performance

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,580
we're not losing much

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,850
this is actually an observation that

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,850
that runs for one and a half hour age

00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:25,309
the flow chart I showed earlier

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:28,320
unfortunately runs even on a brand-new I

00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:29,970
$9.99 hundred K or something one fifth

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,620
of real time and that flow chart is

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,450
actually only a quarter of what I want

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,600
to do because the twin rx actually has

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:39,179
four inputs so having been two previous

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,840
near annual events I said I'm gonna do

00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:44,280
this in her up knock shouldn't be all

00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,010
that hard I mean I've got one hundred

00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,110
megahertz of data 100 mega sample coming

00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,240
in I want to break this down into four

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,580
channels and I want to quantize that

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,700
only two bits because originally I'm

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,530
getting like a 3.2 gigabit per or per

00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,350
turn or X input but what I actually need

00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:05,789
is once it's quantized at two bits it's

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:08,880
only 256 megabit so and also the extra

00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:11,960
turn has like the huge FBI unit so this

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,220
is the progress before this is like the

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,230
block that's already in there that gives

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,450
you your samples out of your Etsy stream

00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:21,390
and then I wrote a fraction of the waste

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:23,909
time for five to four to go from 100

00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,929
mega sample to 80 and then I made for

00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:27,690
VDCs

00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,909
that has a 5 to 1 we saw poor officer

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,990
them so that I would have four streams

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:36,870
of 16 mega samples each then I wanted to

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,970
two-bit quantize them and interleave

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,470
them get the timestamps on it but

00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,129
actually at this point my PJs

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:46,389
already getting pretty full and I'm not

00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:48,159
really at a quarter of what I actually

00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:51,429
want to put in there so if there's

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,440
people here who are more knowledgeable

00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:56,110
about Arab knock I would definitely like

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,659
to hear from you shoot is even fit is

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,789
this like a way to make anyway I should

00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:02,799
have found a different solution so far

00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:06,639
we're doing it the slow way but I would

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:09,549
really like to do this in real time and

00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:11,500
that sort of brings me to the

00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,669
conclusions from this story story we

00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,370
have a working VLBI

00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:18,700
backend using a commercial off-the-shelf

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,529
SDR and it works and we can process the

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,779
data in clear a do to get it to the same

00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:25,299
format that any Iranian telescope that

00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:26,919
this field way I have you doing

00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:28,539
reference clock transfer using white

00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:32,980
rabbit and not just over 10 kilometers

00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:34,720
but we can do 170 kilometers with a

00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,919
frequency stability that we've

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,889
calculated is good enough for

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,919
observations at frequencies up to 14

00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:44,740
gigahertz and we get timing accuracy

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,139
better than 1 nanoseconds so all of that

00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:58,090
works pretty well and that is where I

00:25:47,139 --> 00:26:00,340
break for questions thank you so you you

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:04,330
you mentioned that the white rabbit

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,590
switch that you're using isn't or you

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,450
made a comment that it's somehow

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,549
different or that you wouldn't be look

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:11,919
at the precision you needed with an

00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:13,389
actual white rabbits which can you

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,139
elaborate on a little bit what is it

00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:18,429
what is the performance a white rabbit

00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:21,639
naturally black that you had to make up

00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:24,149
for so it was improved in two ways the

00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:27,730
load get the dog Volta board really

00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:30,970
makes the island deviation like I think

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,590
more than effect return better and then

00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:37,120
there's was also cleanup oscillator that

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:38,740
takes care of lots of nasty are moist

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,389
spikes that you have in there are of eye

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,009
spikes and the combination gives four it

00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:44,019
makes makes for a really clean clean

00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:45,490
signal and I have from a longer

00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,590
presentation that I can show you there's

00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:51,879
we have pictures it's also be published

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:54,960
how we are we've done that we have time

00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:54,960
for one

00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:04,700
what goes so assuming I know a field

00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:07,550
near cars will wear like 10 3 meter

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:11,120
dishes sent around how would I go about

00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:13,040
getting you know maybe a reliable

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,410
cloaking signal without running a

00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,690
fiber-optic cables can I build something

00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:19,580
that's based on a radio receiver to

00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:28,570
discipline a local oscillator I have to

00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:31,430
say oh sorry then yeah okay if I have a

00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:33,200
dish somewhere couple kilometres away

00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,210
from my clock source how would I go

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,030
about disciplining a local oscillator

00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:41,030
without running the fiber can I do that

00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:42,260
weather like a radio receiver maybe not

00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:46,060
really something I've looked into I

00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,060
would say run fire is lots of fun but

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,490
okay there were no more hands I think so

00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,810
maybe you can have one more round of

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:59,740
applause

00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:59,740
