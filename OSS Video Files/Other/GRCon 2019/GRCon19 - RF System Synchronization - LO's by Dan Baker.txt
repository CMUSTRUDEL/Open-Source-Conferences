	RF System Synchronization - LO's by Dan Baker, Brian Avenell

Multi-channel applications including MIMO, phased array RADAR, and direction finding require channel-to-channel phase and time synchronization. Phase synchronization implies having deterministic relative phase between all of the radio channels. This presentation introduces the various techniques for ensuring phase synchronization between multiple radio channels. Merits between sharing a common low frequency reference signal and distributing the actual LO signals will be discussed.
