was a pleasure to be here I saw the show

00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,750
of hands for extra class hands how many

00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,830
hams are in the audience here just

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,100
generally oh wow

00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:27,850
fantastic okay I feel right at home I'm

00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,550
not a communications engineer I'm and

00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,890
and my experience with new radio is just

00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,320
kind of dabbling with it as a hobbyist

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,650
with SDR play and actually put together

00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,540
a little single-sideband decoder to play

00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,250
with for ham radio so so that's my

00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,220
experience there but what I want to talk

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:49,690
to you about is what was going on 50

00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:53,470
years ago now was of course 50 years ago

00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:57,400
in July was the anniversary of the

00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,900
Apollo 11 mission and unless you were

00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,820
living in a cave somewhere you couldn't

00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,030
have missed that it was on all the all

00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,549
the media outlets and everything and we

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:10,240
had a special event operation kind of a

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:13,000
NASA wide one for amateur radio but it's

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,930
kind of nice to look back and see how

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,460
this was done

00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:20,740
it always amazes me as we are are trying

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,240
to you know develop the capability to

00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,830
get back to the moon now and I'll talk

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,980
about that at the end of the discussion

00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,590
here looking back and seeing how they

00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:34,420
did it 50 years ago just never ceases to

00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:37,180
amaze me there was you know the

00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,030
technology back then was totally

00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:44,290
different and you know not nearly as

00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:46,930
capable but let me move along to the

00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,960
next slide here so of course this is a

00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,180
big deal here in Huntsville because we

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,490
built the Saturn 5 here we I didn't know

00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,800
it was 14 years old at the time but

00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,090
that's a one of our great legacies here

00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,040
in Huntsville and we're building the

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,370
next great rocket as well the the Space

00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:09,280
Launch System that I'll talk about and

00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:11,550
so what we were seeing 50 years ago was

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,550
this

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,750
[Music]

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:52,000
all right so that's what we saw and what

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,530
we heard fifty years ago and I started

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,110
researching this to figure out how did

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,420
they do it you know what was the the the

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,890
hardware what bands were they using and

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,240
that's what I'll talk about today the

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,440
kind of the rough outline here's we'll

00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,750
talk about how the audio got back and

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,050
the key is USB and that is not upper

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,150
sideband as you'll see they'll talk

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,550
about some amateur radio involvement

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,140
here we called this extreme shortwave

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,470
listening it was a shortwave it was

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,990
s-band but extreme SMAN listening by

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,400
hams and talk about some of the options

00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,460
for the comm something that you may have

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,590
noticed in that clip right there was

00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,730
that that was armstrong and aldrin on

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,280
the surface and of course they were

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,770
talking to Mission Control but then you

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,260
heard them also talking to Mike Collins

00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,390
who was in the command service module

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,790
orbiting around the moon at the time and

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,490
so talk about kind of how that was done

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:52,660
what some of the architecture there was

00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:54,700
how we got color video out of that that

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,820
really grainy awful looking

00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,410
black-and-white there and then I'll talk

00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,010
about what our plans are for the future

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,270
what we're going to do next so let me

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,580
see if I can do this first of all the

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,590
one of the iconic things that that we

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,290
all remember and anytime somebody's kind

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,180
of simulating you know air-to-ground

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,950
communication they always put the beep

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,230
in there right so that's called AK wind

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,120
or tone and that's the name of the

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:23,860
company who developed this is these

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,260
Quinn dark tones and they they were used

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,770
really just push-to-talk that was the

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:32,680
idea so there was I'll talk about the

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,009
ranging capability of the system in a

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,439
moment

00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:37,180
but because they wanted to keep a

00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,389
continuous carrier going up to the

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:44,169
command service module they had to keep

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:46,119
the and they didn't want the Capcom and

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:48,339
Mission Control to be live all the time

00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:50,800
going through that system they had this

00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:53,349
tone system called Quinn dark tones and

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,919
so when he pushed a talk on his headset

00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:58,869
in Mission Control the intro tone went

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,909
out and then when he released the

00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:03,129
push-to-talk the outro tone went out and

00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:06,639
so that way they were able to keep that

00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:09,599
line going keep that audio going but not

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,759
have a live mic for him all the time and

00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:21,939
let's see if we can play this here the

00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:25,659
intro tone is that 25 25 Hertz and the

00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:27,610
outro was 50 Hertz lower tell the

00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,770
difference there between the the intro

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,699
and the outro so that was just used to

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,680
key the the ground stations which could

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,800
have been as far away from the mission

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,449
control as Australia to tell them okay

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,879
now take the audio coming from Mission

00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:47,559
Control and send it up so that's all

00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:51,430
that was this s band carrier was as I

00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:53,469
mentioned to set up kind of constantly

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,999
so they would be able to do ranging and

00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:56,919
they used two pseudo run random-number

00:05:54,999 --> 00:06:00,430
code for the ranging and I'll talk about

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:03,339
that a little bit more alright so the

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,199
Snoopy cap is what the astronauts use

00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:07,689
there you can see the but the inside

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,050
look like couple of headsets and then

00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:13,180
the the two boom mics and you can see

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:17,199
why they were called Snoopy hats at the

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:19,360
time Snoopy course and the Peanuts comic

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,999
strip was very popular back back in that

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:27,459
time period I did hear I listened to a

00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:29,919
lot of the the audio and the kind of the

00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:31,120
full mission audio while they were on

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,839
the surface of the Moon during the

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,550
anniversary through this Apollo in real

00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,039
time anybody else familiar with that

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,659
anybody else try that out yeah that was

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,839
extremely cool that's still out there I

00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:47,680
have a link for it at the end here so on

00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:50,050
that the July 20th that eat

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,270
you could listen in real-time of what

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,460
was happening exactly fifty years ago

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,800
and so I watched the holy VA and I

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,080
remember Aldrin they kept having a hard

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,170
time hearing him from time to time and

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,940
so he finally said well one of these

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,260
microphones is in my mouth and I can't

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,640
do anything about it you know it was

00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,930
kind of you know you can't take your

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,090
helmet off obviously when you're on the

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,450
surface there to move it so they had the

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,300
two mics and so that was the audio from

00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:19,720
to and from the crew

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:22,720
so this USB that's unified s-band system

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,870
now what they had before this according

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,140
to my historical research during mercury

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:32,710
and Gemini programs they used HF VHF UHF

00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,290
they kind of had an ANSI band for

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,150
tracking radar transponders for tracking

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,770
so they had all these different radios

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,350
all these different systems on the

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,660
spacecraft and some of them were

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,290
telemetry some of them were for audio

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,390
and so they decided with Apollo they

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,680
needed something smaller and lighter

00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,910
you're going all the way to the moon you

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,050
know you don't want to carry all you

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,530
know a whole bunch of different radios

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,480
with you

00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,490
so they came up with this unified s-band

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:02,080
system this sort of did all of it had

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:04,090
voice digital the ranging signals from

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,200
the ground to the spacecraft and in

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,760
spacecraft to ground you know they

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,080
included telemetry to TV the biomed data

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,330
they had an emergency voice channel and

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,980
even an emergency key they could do CW

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,660
they could do Morse code if they needed

00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,910
to they only tested it I think on Apollo

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,740
7 fortunately they never needed it but

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,060
if it had some other problems with

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,400
antenna pointing or something like that

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,300
they actually could could do Morse code

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,919
they were able to communicate with

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,950
command module that was where most of

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,620
the data of course flowed from the lunar

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,360
module and the Saturn s4b

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,000
I should mention that all of this

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,919
information here is from a NASA

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,830
technical memo and it was actually a

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,500
conference paper back in 1966 it

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:55,750
describes this system and if you want to

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:59,200
look that up you can probably lost a

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,610
signal there you can look that up and

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,050
read more to tell you

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,640
how this works I want to challenge you

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,130
guys I don't know a whole lot about the

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,170
new radio and how you use it in academia

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:12,070
but this would make a very cool class

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,810
project I think to tell the students use

00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,120
these modern tools that you have these

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,670
modern software tools and just simulate

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,800
this whole s-band unified s-pen system

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,550
so I'll just throw that out there is a

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,180
challenge of something you may want to

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,130
try

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,990
I kept thinking as I was reading about

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,269
how they did all this stuff with you

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,480
know analog circuitry how much easier

00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:32,490
would be today

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,140
alright so that's what it looked like

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,940
that was one of the radios you can see a

00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,480
little scale there I think that's a six

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,860
inch scale so it's fairly small but

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,920
packed a lot of information packed there

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,589
that was based on a design that the I

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,750
think Jet Propulsion lab had kind of

00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:52,660
come up with for some of the unmanned

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,630
spacecraft Goddard was involved Collins

00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:05,199
radio Motorola some of the big names

00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:11,649
were involved in that yeah okay it's

00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:13,269
over here so all right yeah there's our

00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,970
modern technology for us right

00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:17,440
all right so both the spacecraft had a

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,000
lot of antennas on them you can see

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,010
there there were Omni antennas body

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,890
mounted on the command service module

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,540
and I'm gonna try to avoid using the

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,010
pointer too much because there's so much

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,370
action here but there's some Omni

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:36,699
antennas out there you can see the the

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:37,959
big the for Bay dish antenna there and

00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:40,120
of course that was for the high rate

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:42,490
data the lunar module had two Omni

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,040
antennas it also had VHF antennas and

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,959
that was used during the epa's during

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,209
the moon walks to talk to the crew so

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,470
they could relay their signals back to

00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:56,920
earth and so there's some VHF antennas

00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:01,510
ear a nest band high gain antenna on the

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,750
lunar module up here and then they had a

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:07,209
radar antenna as well they used for the

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:10,120
the rendezvous when they link back up

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:13,480
with a command service module and before

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,470
they left the moon alright the ground

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,040
antennas there were

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,900
classes of those there was a 30-foot

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,410
dish and an 85-foot dish both Casa

00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,240
cranes

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,650
and you can see the gains and the beam

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,570
wits there and the acquisition antennas

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:32,170
but I think the interesting thing is

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:35,380
they were 20 kilowatt transmitters used

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:37,360
klystrons there you can see the the

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,550
preamps parametric amplifiers and

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,800
frequencies has been about 2.1 gigahertz

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,940
there were sub carriers that were used

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,880
and we'll see a picture of this in a

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,040
moment of where they put the voice and

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:58,060
the data but those are the different sub

00:11:51,040 --> 00:12:00,220
carriers and you can see with the this

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,780
is uplink of course but the downlink is

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,090
very similar they had a one kilohertz

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,710
Inc tone and they had this sine way by

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,290
phase modulated I guess we're still

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,590
using something kind of like that these

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,070
days

00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:15,190
and then the ranging code and this

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:17,680
looked at me like reminding me a whole

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,150
lot of either radar or GPS you know

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,030
where you have this pseudo-random number

00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:25,570
code and what they did here is they they

00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:28,270
modulated the the s-band signal with

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,860
this and they had two different ones 70

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,610
millisecond one when they were in close

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:35,890
to the earth and then a 5.4 second one

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,810
which you know repeated every 5 4.4

00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,460
seconds well the range time to the moon

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,710
is only one and a half seconds or round

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,600
trips about three seconds so they could

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,490
have used this even farther I'll pass

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,940
the moon without ambiguity so there's

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,410
this this PRN code that was transmitted

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,820
up and then they just turned around and

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,260
transmitted it back down and by

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,480
correlating those on the ground they

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,780
could figure out how far away the

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,310
spacecraft was to within a few meters I

00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,680
think is what I read there so that's

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:06,460
that's pretty accurate

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:09,910
also the carrier was they had a phase

00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,920
lock loop and then you know use that to

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:15,490
generate the signal coming back to earth

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,830
and by by tracking the the frequency of

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,170
that carrier they were able to get the

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,720
range rate to within I think it was a

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,490
you know 10 centimeters per second or

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,890
something like that so the very precise

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,500
range and range rate and then of course

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,570
they had the as L

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,880
from the ground tracking antenna so with

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,380
that information and assuming ballistic

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,820
trajectory you know that's how they

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:45,420
tracked to the moon so um very very

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:47,220
simple but clever process all right

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:52,170
that's what one of the 85-foot ground

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:54,390
stations look like in Australia and now

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,910
here's the the spectrum of the downlink

00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,260
and I will have to kind of point at this

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,750
a little bit there's the carrier it was

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,230
a phase modulated carrier and in the

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,210
this document this TM technical memo

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,280
document talks about they tried to keep

00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,890
the modulation index kind of low so you

00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:14,370
had a nice strong carrier to lock on to

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:17,420
they didn't want to you know lose the

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:22,670
carrier and all the other signal there

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:24,420
and you can see the voice and telemetry

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,920
subcarriers they tried to put that

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:31,200
pretty close to one of the nulls there

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,520
in the PRN code modulation and then they

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,120
had these other modes where they could

00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:39,720
kind of turn off the the tracking PRN

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,730
code and just have the television and in

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,920
the voice and the telemetry or they

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,650
could turn everything off except for the

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,220
voice and then here is that CW of the

00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:52,290
Morse code 512 kilohertz subcarrier that

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:57,390
could use just for emergency key they

00:14:52,290 --> 00:15:00,380
called it so the voice we got things

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:03,510
like that and I think also in the voice

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:06,210
signal was the biomedical data so this

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:09,270
is a heart rate of buzz aldrin as they

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:11,430
were on the moon and that's the

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:14,550
telemetry of course that came back all

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,500
the information that as you saw Apollo

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,300
13 everything that went the screens went

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,010
blank or they lost all the data you know

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:25,760
when they lost comm after the explosion

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:30,230
and then the tracking talked about that

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:33,030
and of course the video and then that

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,470
emergency key so that's all of the the

00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:40,310
information that was just packed into

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:42,329
that 1s band signal now the spacecraft

00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:46,350
radio characteristics

00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:49,199
used a traveling wave tube twt 20 Watts

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,059
was a primary mode they also had a hands

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,540
call a QR p mode that could run five

00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:56,249
watts if they needed to and talked about

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,170
the antennas already there's all the the

00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:03,749
frequencies and it's interesting they

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:06,389
they use this 240 divided by 2 21 as the

00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:09,389
ratio of the uplink to the downlink and

00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:11,339
so they had that kind of wired in very

00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:14,639
carefully so that they could use the

00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,769
Doppler to figure out the you know the

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,709
velocity of the spacecraft and there's

00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:21,959
the info on the voice and limitary

00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:24,149
subcarriers and the television I'll talk

00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,160
about a little bit more all right of

00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:29,459
course hams had to get into the act here

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,129
and radio amateurs have for a long time

00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:34,799
done really the extreme part of ham

00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:37,949
radio is called moon bounce or earth

00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,600
moon earth and this is simply bouncing a

00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:41,160
communication signal off the moon just

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,610
having a scattered off the moon it was

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,319
all done with Morse code back in the day

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,499
is done with digital modes now something

00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:51,540
called jt65 is very popular for that

00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:53,459
kind of thing but the guys who were who

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,709
were ready to do this back in the 60s

00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:59,489
and 70s thought well let's see if we can

00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:02,100
hear the the radios from Apollo and so

00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:07,250
there were two of them that published in

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,250
this qst that's the amateur radio

00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:12,329
American radio relay League a double

00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,649
Ariella mono you know a double RL

00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,649
memorize should remember that that's

00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:19,529
their main magazine so back in 1972 they

00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:22,470
had this article about how two hams

00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:26,250
actually heard Apollo 15 the command

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,779
service module and and both of them if

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,929
you go through and read the account they

00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:33,059
are RL members can can go look at the

00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:35,039
archives and find this magazine here

00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,700
June 72 and read about this it's

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,830
fascinating

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,080
both of them kind of independently did

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,850
this and neither of them were expecting

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,409
to hear the signal and they didn't have

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,610
their tape recorders running so they

00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,809
weren't able to record it they just

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,580
heard it kind of come through the

00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,250
speaker all of a sudden and then got

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:54,950
more intentional about it later

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:56,630
so that's who they heard I was a warden

00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:00,740
is on the command service module the

00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:05,900
command module pilot and so the to work

00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:09,260
a two-hour WRI W and W for hhk and I

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:13,040
love this this one here the antenna feed

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:15,650
was a an American paint can and a

00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,180
Scottish oatmeal can I don't know

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,840
there's something magical I guess about

00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,310
the dimensions of a Scottish oatmeal can

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,840
how he came by that I'm not really sure

00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:28,760
but to build the antenna feed and so

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,500
both of them had kind of kind of similar

00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,460
you know big dishes with with their

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,320
feeds there and they said that the

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,210
command module at the time was it was

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,240
about 13 watts so they were able to hear

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:44,330
13 watts at yes ban with these big

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:48,680
dishes so here's a block diagram of K to

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:52,430
irw system and I'll zoom in a little bit

00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:54,320
here and show you that you know there's

00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,210
there's a parametric amplifiers and

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,910
spectrum analyzers and all kinds of

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:02,180
stuff in there but there's an amico two

00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:05,270
meter converter which I know a lot of

00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:07,700
hams used at the time Drake receiver and

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:10,700
a modified Knight receiver so that's

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:17,510
good to see some good old ham gear and

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:19,370
in the system here now they tried again

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,040
with Apollo 16 I have you know kind of

00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,600
from the success of this and and it's

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,160
really amazing what was accomplished

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,160
here first of all they were able to

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,410
detect the lunar module carrier and from

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,570
the Doppler these guys could measure

00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,780
could tell when it's sat down on the

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:38,360
surface when it quit moving now there's

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,710
your conspiracy theorist would have to

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,060
explain that I guess that could have

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,160
been faked too right you know we could

00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,260
have sent a spacecraft to do the same

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,510
kind of thing but that's pretty amazing

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,210
they're able to do that they also

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,950
detected the uplink signal this 20

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,920
kilowatt signal coming from these big

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,750
dishes they detected that scattered from

00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,520
the moon so this is the moon bouncing

00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,940
well you know ham just kind of like do

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,320
what one-and-a-half kilowatts and so

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,300
they were able to you know they were

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,880
doing moon bounce back back in that

00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,870
timeframe with one and half kilowatt so

00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,930
it seemed like I guess

00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:16,010
easy to do with 20 kilowatt uplink and

00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:18,350
then there's a a 1 watt signal from the

00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:21,050
outset scientific packages this is what

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:23,180
each of the Apollo crews left on the

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,010
surface of the Moon that we're

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,910
seismometers and I've got a picture ever

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,620
here in a minute we'll go through all

00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,110
that but they were able to detect that

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,410
one watt signal coming from those things

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,580
so I think that's that's pretty amazing

00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,890
that's what the owl sets looked like

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,410
they had a little radioisotope

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,690
thermoelectric generators on them to run

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,790
the seismometers and magnetometers and

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:48,950
you can see all the other instruments

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:52,940
there and so and there's the yes band

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:55,400
antenna there pointed at the earth 1

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,760
watt and they detected that pretty

00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,880
amazing alright so there was a lot of

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,679
reconfigurability in the system just in

00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,350
case they had problems or they needed to

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,390
do something a little bit different and

00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:11,450
these are just a few of the options here

00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:14,120
so they could use VHF to talk between

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,400
the lunar module and the command service

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:21,710
module full duplex you know two

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:24,740
different frequencies and then if they

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,070
needed to talk to the command service

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,540
module when it was below the horizon

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,300
they could do that through the earth so

00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,760
s-band up to earth and then out to the

00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,130
command service module and think about

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,410
this for a second each leg of this took

00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:41,210
one and a half seconds and so you've got

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,179
four hops essentially here so there's

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:50,059
six seconds that delay that you'd have

00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:54,860
to have to deal with and then there's

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:57,110
the VHF comm between the crewmembers the

00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,160
limb and then that was sent back up and

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,290
back down

00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,640
you know from the s-band system I

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:08,000
noticed that I think Apollo 11 they did

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,050
not deploy one of these kind of dishes

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,470
here and and again in listening to the

00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:18,560
to the real near the 50 year plus

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:21,740
real-time audio I did hear Armstrong ask

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,580
do you have a good TV signal and what he

00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,560
was asking

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,270
essentially do I need to bother setting

00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,270
up this antenna and they were getting

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:31,310
enough video and of course it wasn't

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:34,580
great it was a slow scan whoops

00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:36,590
back up kind of grainy stuff that was

00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,810
coming through the s-band antenna on the

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,270
lunar module not one of these dishes

00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:43,520
here now with Apollo 12 they switch to

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,080
that kind of dish I don't know if you

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,310
remember Apollo 12 they kind of

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,320
accidentally pointed the camera at the

00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:54,650
Sun and that was the end of video from

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:56,450
from that mission and but they did have

00:22:54,650 --> 00:23:00,410
that dish set up and we got a little bit

00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:02,060
of video kind of early on and then

00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,190
there's all this once they had the the

00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,510
lunar rover which was also developed

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,060
here at Marshall

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,160
they had additional communications

00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:15,680
capability it had its own s-band dish

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:19,220
and could send video back as well as the

00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:23,420
you know repeat the VHF audio from the

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:29,300
crew alright so how did they do that

00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:32,270
video well it was this ancient vidicon

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,030
technology I think the camera on the

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:38,120
left there the guys right hand is the

00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:39,260
onboard and I saw a picture of the back

00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,730
of it I think that actually had a

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,340
monitor on it so they could see what

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,200
they were looking at and of course that

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,290
was the CRT II type monitor back then

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,260
and then the one and on our right there

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:54,830
is the surface camera and that's what

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:58,870
was used you know to show us the video

00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:03,950
from the from the surface of the Moon

00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:06,050
the Apollo 11 video was it was all black

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,580
and white ten frames per second slow

00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,280
scan so that kept the data rate down

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,860
kept the band width down only 320 lines

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,650
and then to get standard video that they

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,350
could distribute then to all the news

00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:21,710
outlets so that you know Walter Cronkite

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,900
could could share the video with us they

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,730
actually had a camera looking at the

00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,560
screen on a ground station that was

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,570
looking at the slow scan 10 frame per

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,540
second thing they recorded it to a

00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:35,390
magnetic disk and replayed it five times

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,020
each to get the 30 frames per second or

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,350
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,850
per second of standard video so just

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,250
amazing to think that you had a camera

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,530
looking at a monitor and this disk and

00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:49,040
do it all this shenanigans to get us

00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:53,120
some standard video pretty clever

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,900
all right so we saw black and white from

00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:00,410
Apollo 11 and 12 I can't remember when

00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,150
the color came in I think maybe 12-month

00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,510
even been a color camera but how would

00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:07,880
they get the color from a

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:11,140
black-and-white vidicon well TV cameras

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:15,260
of that day were pretty big and they had

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,940
three different video encoders in front

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,270
of them that use a beam splitter so they

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,030
take you know the light coming in and

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:24,140
split it up into three colors and

00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,300
running through some optics into these

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,100
these video cards and then you'd have

00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,830
the red green and blue signals coming

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,870
out and that obviously was not going to

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,010
work for sending into space because you

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,420
would probably had to leave one of the

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,910
crew members behind if you're carrying

00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:40,160
something that big with you and keeping

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,809
all of that stuff aligned with all the

00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,970
launch loads and vibrations I'm sure

00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:46,790
would have been really tough so they

00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,160
came up with this this scheme where you

00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:55,400
spin a color filter wheel in front of

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:59,120
the black-and-white camera and they had

00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,400
to red to green to blue filters running

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,920
at ten revolutions per second that ends

00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,480
up giving you the the 60 fields per

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,750
second that you want that was a wider

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,400
bandwidth signal and the this report

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,140
said that they had to do significant

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,450
filtering to keep that from interfering

00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,179
with the the other s-band

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,920
components all the telemetry and ranging

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,420
and all that stuff so a lot of analog

00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,360
filtering going on then they use

00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,160
videotape to correct the video sink for

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,840
Doppler obviously these spacecraft are

00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,710
moving you know the video sync signal is

00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:34,040
moving along and so they used a

00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:36,920
videotape system for that and then

00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,270
another magnetic disk recorder to spin

00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,420
at the proper rate there

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,740
recorded the RG and me on six separate

00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,960
tracks and then they ran them back

00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,740
simultaneously to generate the color and

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,820
so I thought that's so clever too to

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,170
come up with

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,420
that kind of thing and I'm not sure if

00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:56,600
you can tell exactly there but if you

00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,580
look very carefully you can kind of tell

00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,280
that thing was was spinning now this is

00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:05,330
one of the lunar rover videos of the

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:07,460
launch of the asset module back up from

00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:11,330
the surface and if you look right here

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,400
there's a blue green and red so that was

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,560
some piece of debris that was blown off

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:20,300
the upper stage I mean the the lower

00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:22,520
stage the descent module as the engine

00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,440
ignited and you can kind of see that

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,770
there's you know blue green and red here

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,020
so that particle was moving fast enough

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:32,480
that you captured it in one color filter

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,860
at one point and in the next color

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,180
filter at the next point in the next one

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,830
the next point seeing you can kind of

00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,540
tell how that worked there so it was

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:42,790
fine for guys walking around the surface

00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:46,520
but for a very dynamic events like that

00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:48,500
you see some artifacts obviously so you

00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,090
can tell that's how it worked I think

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,010
they use something similar to this on

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,130
shuttle during the early days they must

00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,080
have gone to see CDs at some point but

00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:59,120
because I remember seeing some kind of

00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,770
dynamic events of some you know piece of

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,990
junk floating away from the shuttle and

00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:05,630
seeing the red green blue components of

00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:10,190
it so I think that was used early on in

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:11,060
shuttle so you'd need you know that

00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,400
wider band width

00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:17,960
need better signal of the s-band and

00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:19,340
they had this deployable antenna that

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,420
they could set up on the surface and

00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,880
then when they had the lunar rover

00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,110
starting with Apollo 15 they had a

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,730
little antenna and every time they

00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,470
stopped parked the rover they had to get

00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:31,790
out and point that antenna back up

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:34,910
toward the earth and and then the ground

00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:36,770
could take control of the camera you can

00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,720
see the camera right there they always

00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,700
kind of pointed it down and back to keep

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,320
the dust off of it but still you would

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,600
see them during most of these EPA's pull

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,750
out a paint brush and and dust the dust

00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,700
off the lens so that we get a good view

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:53,630
from Earth but the ground controllers

00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:57,050
could pan tilt and zoom that camera and

00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:59,560
watch the crew as they were walking

00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,560
around

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:39,390
I like skip along boy it's amazing what

00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:42,300
an amazing time it was all right so

00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,680
that's what the the lunar surface assets

00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,980
look like and I don't remember which

00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:51,630
mission this could be 11 there's the

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:54,480
camera that was looking back at the the

00:29:51,630 --> 00:30:02,160
lander and the part of the alsep system

00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:05,100
there so that was then and we were you

00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,170
know just lasted well I guess from 1969

00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,290
that the plaque on the left there is the

00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:11,730
one from Apollo 11 here men from the

00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:15,390
planet Earth first set foot upon the

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,200
moon July 1969 ad we came in peace for

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:20,600
all mankind

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:23,040
and then Apollo 17 in December of 1972

00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,980
here man completed his first

00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,960
explorations of the moon December 1972

00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,360
ad he made the spirit of peace in which

00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,910
we came be reflected the lives of all

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,630
mankind and we haven't been back yet and

00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:38,400
that's kind of a shame we've had a few

00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:40,200
fits and starts here with different

00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,480
administrations of saying let's go back

00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,240
to the moon we've got a pretty pretty

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,130
good head of steam now but it all

00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,190
depends on the political will and the

00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,840
funding and all that but talk to you a

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:55,080
little bit about what our plans are for

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,930
returning to the moon now the program is

00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,370
called Artemis and I've got a video here

00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,140
at the end I'll probably talk about this

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:08,940
but that's the twin sister of Apollo

00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:12,390
that's pretty cool and our plans are to

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,230
have boots on the moon is the direction

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,590
that we were given

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:19,740
by 2024 that's pretty ambitious we have

00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,380
the rocket we have a capsule the lander

00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:26,010
is under development now and we're not

00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:28,470
there yet by any means but I've never

00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,380
seen NASA move so fast on something I'll

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,660
tell you it's been dizzying the the

00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,150
speed at which we're doing this so back

00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,309
in December of 2017 there was a space

00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:40,049
policy directed from the what directive

00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:41,490
from the White House to return to the

00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:44,640
moon and on to Mars and the plan at the

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:47,370
time was by 2028 I get to the moon

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,610
then in March vice president pence was

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:53,490
here before the was National Space

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:55,020
Council and right over here at the Space

00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:58,679
and Rocket Center and said ok we want

00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:00,720
you to do about 2024 and to land humans

00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:08,280
near the lunar South Pole and I'll talk

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:10,470
about why that's interesting the you you

00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,559
can do these you know go back in a hurry

00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:17,700
and land and you know put down the flag

00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,740
and take pictures and you know one small

00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,290
step and all that kind of stuff but the

00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,390
idea here is to make this sustainable so

00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:27,570
that we can keep doing it that we don't

00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:29,850
just do these little camping trips and

00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:33,000
you know real real quick ones and so

00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:36,299
I'll tell you a little bit about the the

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,090
architecture for doing that it will be

00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:40,710
done with something called gateway which

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,860
you'll see in a moment and the human

00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:47,370
human landing system which may have

00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,070
multiple elements to it we're I think

00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:51,240
there's getting ready to be some

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:53,070
contracts let here and in the near

00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,840
future is already some studies going on

00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,540
by contractors but there may be a

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,340
transfer descent NASA elements and

00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,970
they'll all be aggregated or kind of

00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,440
assembled at this gateway and then

00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,419
hopefully the ascend element will be

00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,700
reusable refuel and maybe even the

00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,919
transfer element to the Space Launch

00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,880
System that we're developing now which

00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,100
will be more powerful than the Saturn 5

00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,780
and this Orien capsule will ferry the

00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,580
crew and some of the hardware and then

00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,409
there will be commercial launches to

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,480
transport some of the hardware and the

00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:26,280
logistics so that's kind of in the

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,090
planning right now remember Apollo the

00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,970
way we did that

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,320
put it all on one rocket so you had the

00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:34,590
command service module and the lunar

00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,620
module all stacked up there and send it

00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:40,140
all at one time and so all of your

00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:42,750
capability was was sent at once and the

00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:46,170
idea here with the Space Launch System

00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:49,410
and Gateway is to send those pieces

00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:54,510
individually and assemble them in lunar

00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:56,250
orbit so west LS this may look familiar

00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,830
that's kind of like an external tank on

00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:01,410
steroids from the shuttle just bigger

00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,960
and we're testing those elements right

00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,540
now out of Marshall doing structural

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,310
tests on them the boosters on the side

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,410
here are like shuttle solid rocket

00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,910
boosters only longer they got an extra

00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:14,340
segment in them to make them more

00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:16,440
powerful and the engines our shuttle

00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,670
main engines kind of upgraded a bit but

00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,800
there'll be four of them instead of

00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,600
three so with all of this stuff you get

00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,300
the extra power you need to get to the

00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,700
moon there's an upper stage here this

00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,760
initially will be based on the Delta

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:32,280
cryogenic second stage a DC SS is called

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,680
the interim cryo propulsion stage here

00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,810
but there's also development going on

00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,940
now for the exploration upper stage

00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:41,280
which is a more powerful version of an

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,910
upper stage and up on top of it the

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,860
capsule and the Orion and the service

00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:50,550
module and European Space Agency is

00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,930
providing that service module so those

00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,490
are the pieces that's what Orion looks

00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:56,510
like and this shape may look really

00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:59,340
familiar to you this is exactly the same

00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:02,010
aspect ratio I guess you'd call it our

00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,230
outer mold line shape as the Apollo

00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,700
capsule I remember when they started

00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,500
development of this they started looking

00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,960
around what's the best shape to use for

00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,700
you know reentering from the moon at

00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,260
these very high speeds and it turned out

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,630
that what they came up with for Apollo

00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,110
was pretty doggone good so they stuck

00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:21,330
with that that kind of shape it's bigger

00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:25,080
it'll carry four crew members and it can

00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:27,570
stay a whole lot longer at the at the

00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,880
moon I have solar panels instead of the

00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:32,940
fuel cells which kind of had a limited

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,040
lifetime on Apollo they run out of

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,020
hydrogen and oxygen so you get much

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,670
longer stay times with with this

00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:44,490
hardware and and that's what the Gateway

00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:48,000
and the lander looks like and the

00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:49,800
Gateway portion is this there's a power

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,630
and propulsion element which has these

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,210
big solar arrays and that'll have ion

00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:57,510
engines on it so they'll be able to test

00:35:54,210 --> 00:36:00,510
that technology for changing the orbit

00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:03,180
around the moon with that there's

00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:05,430
something called mini hab here

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,190
that is sort of a pass through to go

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:12,450
from a logistics module so that's you

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:14,250
know hardware and food and you know all

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:18,540
the consumables that will be brought up

00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:20,940
on a commercial launcher and then this

00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:23,220
is what the lander looks like kind of

00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,160
vaguely reminiscent of the lunar module

00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:28,230
but a whole lot bigger there is this

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,130
transfer element that you need to get

00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:34,440
from the orbit that gateway is in which

00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,420
is is called a near rectilinear halo

00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,460
orbit it's a very eccentric orbit around

00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:42,630
the moon seventy-five thousand kilometer

00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,310
a balloon so it'll be in that orbit it

00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,500
doesn't take so much energy to get to

00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:50,940
that orbit so it's kind of easier to

00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:53,700
assemble the hardware there and then you

00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,380
use this stage to get from that orbit

00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,680
down to low lunar orbit and land

00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,630
there's the descent module so I'll have

00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,990
the legs on it you know to sit down on

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,070
the surface and an asset module and

00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:07,410
that's where the crew will be and that's

00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:10,200
the part that comes back up and docks

00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,510
with the Gateway and then the crew can

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,870
climb into Ryan and come home bring them

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:20,270
in rocks home and all that kind of thing

00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:24,360
so that's the idea now gateway phase 2

00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:28,280
after the 20 24 would look like this and

00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:31,410
that action whoops that actually has a

00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:35,370
habitat modules in it so you can have

00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:37,620
crew there for quite a while several

00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:39,210
weeks at a time maybe up to a month I

00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:41,490
think is what they were talking about

00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:42,990
the idea of that is you don't really

00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,270
need that to get to the moon

00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,240
that's probably what a Mars vehicle is

00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:49,980
going to look like very similar to that

00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:52,710
with an ion engine on the back of it and

00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,580
habitat modules and a capsule that you

00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,430
probably have to

00:37:53,580 --> 00:38:00,600
send a you know some kind of assent

00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:02,580
hardware to Mars ahead but the idea is

00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,230
not just to get to the moon with this

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:10,320
hardware but to also test out the

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:11,400
technologies you need to get to Mars and

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,230
that's what the lander might look like

00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,120
sitting on the South Pole the moon now

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,640
it always bothers me I'm an astronomer

00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,590
by training and you see these pictures

00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,270
from the moon and there's there's the

00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:24,660
earth hanging right down near the

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:26,550
horizon and you don't see that from the

00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,610
Apollo science it's always up high in

00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:31,740
the sky because of the the way the moon

00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,660
is tidally locked to the earth but in

00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,400
this case we will have these kind of

00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:39,840
views because the plan is to land at the

00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,610
South Pole both the South Pole and the

00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,060
North Pole have permanently shadowed

00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:47,280
regions and these are craters this is a

00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,350
lighting map based on Lunar

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,850
Reconnaissance Orbiter which is a

00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:53,990
spacecraft that's been operating since

00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:56,070
2009 I think and orbit around the moon

00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:57,630
I'm pointing at this one because it's a

00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:03,960
little darker over there so I hope you

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:05,850
guys can see what's going on these so so

00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,080
LRO has been making measurements it has

00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,540
an altimeter and they build these

00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:13,350
digital elevation models and then they

00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:15,090
fly the moon around the the earth and

00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,680
look at how the sunlight shines on it

00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:20,130
and the bright areas are regions to get

00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,640
a whole lot of sunlight throughout the

00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,280
year

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,930
and the dark regions don't get any

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,360
sunlight so when you get to the South

00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:30,780
Pole because of the moon's orbit it's

00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,160
very low inclination and the moon is

00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,260
only tilted about one and a half degrees

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,110
from its orbit there are regions that

00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,510
never see any sunlight and there's very

00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:41,220
good evidence that there's water mixed

00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:45,090
in with the regolith mixed in with the

00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:47,790
moon dirt there and so when you have

00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:51,300
water and you can mine that and that's

00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:53,370
no easy trick because it's so cold it's

00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,300
about 30 or 40 degrees above absolute

00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:57,480
zero

00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,760
Kelvin in these these craters but if you

00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,440
can get that water out and use some

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,700
solar energy you can crack the water

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,490
into hydrogen and oxygen

00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,380
there's rocket fuel so that's the idea

00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:09,330
is to go to a place

00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:14,130
where there may be resources that we can

00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:17,670
actually use there and the South Pole is

00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:19,260
right around in here I think right along

00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,270
there so it'll be somewhere in that

00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,920
vicinity but possibly on that Ridge or

00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:26,490
somewhere nearby where that first

00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:32,790
landing occurs all right now have a

00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:36,960
video here 50 years ago we pioneer the

00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:38,880
paths of the Moon Trail we blazed cut

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,560
through the fictions of science and

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:47,520
showed us all what is possible today our

00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,960
calling to explore is even greater to go

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,270
farther we must be able to sustain

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,640
missions of greater distance and

00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:56,370
duration where you must use the

00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,080
resources we find at our destinations if

00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:02,700
you recognize overcome the narrator

00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:05,340
issue isolation gravity and extreme

00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,710
environments like never before these are

00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:11,250
the challenges we face to push the

00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:16,550
bounds of humanity we're going to the

00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:19,680
moon to stay by 2024 and this is how

00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:22,320
this all starts with the ability to get

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:25,440
larger heavier payloads off planet and

00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,990
beyond Earth's gravity for this we

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,030
design an entirely new rocket a Space

00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,250
Launch System SLS will be the most

00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,230
powerful rocket ever developed and with

00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,870
components and production and more in

00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:39,870
testing this system is capable of being

00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:42,120
the catalyst for deep space missions we

00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:44,880
need a capsule that can support humans

00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:48,240
from the launch through deep space and

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,670
return safely back to earth for this

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,900
we've built a Ryan this is NASA's

00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:56,310
next-generation human space capsule

00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,110
using data from lunar orbiters that

00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,750
continue to reveal the moon's hazards

00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:02,790
and resources we're currently developing

00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,980
an entirely new approach to landing and

00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,990
operating on the moon using our

00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,090
commercial partners to deliver science

00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:11,280
instruments and robotics to the surface

00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:14,580
we're paving the way for human missions

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:18,300
in 2024 our charge is to cook quickly

00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:21,270
and stay to press our collective efforts

00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,550
forward with a fervor that will see us

00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:27,000
return to the moon in a manner that is

00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:28,530
wholly different than 50 years ago we

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,990
want lunar landers that are reusable

00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:33,420
that can land anywhere on the lunar

00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:35,670
surface the simplest way to do so is to

00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,290
give them a platform in orbit around the

00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,510
moon from which to transition an

00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:41,640
orbiting platform to host deep-space

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,710
experiments and be a waypoint

00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,080
for human capsules we call this lunar

00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,790
outpost gateway the beauty of the

00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,340
Gateway is that it can be moved between

00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:52,500
orbits it will balance between the Earth

00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,750
and moon's gravity in a position that is

00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:58,380
ideal for launching even deeper space

00:42:54,750 --> 00:43:00,890
missions in 2009 we learned the moon

00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:03,810
contains millions of tons of water ice

00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,460
this ice can be extracted and purify for

00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,020
water he was separate an oxygen for

00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,120
breathing or hydrogen for rocket fuel

00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:12,750
the moon is quite uniquely suited to

00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,740
prepare us and propel us to Mars and

00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:17,440
beyond

00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:19,270
this is what we are building this is

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,740
what we're training for this we can

00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:23,230
replicate throughout the solar system

00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,440
this is the next chapter of human space

00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:29,200
exploration humans are the most fragile

00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:32,020
element of this entire endeavor and yet

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,300
we go for humanity they go to the moon

00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:36,910
and on to Mars to seek knowledge and

00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:39,520
understanding and to share it with all

00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:42,310
we go knowing our efforts will create

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,650
opportunities that cannot be foreseen we

00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:47,410
go because we are destined to explore at

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:50,530
seed with our own eyes we turn towards

00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:53,830
the moon now not as a conclusion but as

00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:56,410
preparation as a check point toward all

00:43:53,830 --> 00:44:00,700
that lies beyond our greatest adventures

00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:04,470
remain ahead of us we are going we're

00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,470
going we are going

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,660
we are going we're going

00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:26,380
so you can find any of these slides from

00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:29,329
on the Artemus mission or that video on

00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,119
nasa.gov look for that who's the

00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:33,619
narrator you might recognize it was

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:38,390
Captain Kirk that's right William

00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:40,970
Shatner most of the information that I

00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:43,069
use today came from this how Apollo flew

00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:45,430
to the moon w David woods that's a

00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:47,269
fascinating read it's really interesting

00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:49,099
this guy's done a lot of research

00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:51,829
obviously and figured out how all the

00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:54,470
systems worked you can go to this NASA

00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:56,210
technical report server st I'm not

00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:59,359
nasa.gov and if you're interested in

00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:01,400
that technical memo that I've got most

00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,410
of the info from most of the other info

00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,930
from look at the look for certain

00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:08,569
unified SVN system at Apollo in real

00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:10,400
time org they have an Apollo 11 I think

00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:12,380
there's an Apollo 17 out there - I don't

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,990
know about all the other missions but I

00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,539
need to go check that the QST and if you

00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:20,329
want to explore the moon yourself go to

00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:22,490
quick map if you do this just Google

00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:26,690
quick map you'll probably find it that

00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:28,400
it's quick map El Rock dot asu.edu there

00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:32,240
they have taken all of the Lunar

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,190
Reconnaissance Orbiter data that's maps

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,170
and you know imagery thermal data

00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,089
elevations all of that kind of stuff and

00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,410
put it on there and you can just zoom

00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:41,809
around it's kind of like Google Earth

00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,490
but it's for the moon and there's a

00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:44,690
really good scientific information there

00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,549
but it's really interesting to be able

00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:50,869
to see that and zoom in on the Apollo

00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:53,390
sites and you can see where the descent

00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:55,099
module is sitting and where the tracks

00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,420
for the Rovers word you can even see

00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:58,549
tracks where the astronauts walked

00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,559
because it disturbs a regular enough -

00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:02,809
to change the the brightness or the

00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:07,720
albedo and there's something kind of

00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:10,700
similar called Trek nasa.gov as well so

00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,380
so this is an exciting time it was an

00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:15,200
exciting time 50 years ago but it's

00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,240
pretty exciting time now we just have to

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,829
keep the momentum up and and you know

00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,140
keep the funding and all of that kind of

00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:23,140
stuff but we've really got I think a

00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:26,739
workable plan here

00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:28,900
and by using what they learned from

00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:30,609
Apollo I kept thinking that I sit in the

00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,099
meetings where we're talking about

00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:35,859
what's it like on the moon now we've got

00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:37,900
at least from a few sites from six sites

00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:41,739
you know what the properties of the

00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:44,529
lunar environment is like which is kind

00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:46,089
of my job but also we have enormous

00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:48,640
amount of data from this Lunar

00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:50,529
Reconnaissance Orbiter we have very

00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,869
detailed maps of the South Pole

00:46:50,529 --> 00:46:54,819
now and you know know what the slopes

00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:56,680
and the crater sizes and rocks and all

00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:58,029
that kind of stuff are so I feel like

00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,249
we're ready to go and then we have the

00:46:58,029 --> 00:47:04,359
technology that a lot of you guys work

00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:10,319
on so I think it's doable and it's

00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:10,319
exciting time so just stay tuned and

00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:17,330
hopefully be able to pull this off

00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:25,109
so that's all I have any questions

00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:28,059
[Applause]

00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:30,670
thank you sir for the history and future

00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:32,109
of space exploration my question is when

00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:34,989
you land in the South Poles would have

00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:37,450
permanent shadows how will you get solar

00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:39,249
energy to power the equipment yeah

00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:42,039
that's that's obviously a problem we

00:47:39,249 --> 00:47:43,150
can't land in one of those craters I

00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:44,529
think they're going to have to land on

00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,140
one of the they're permanently

00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:49,630
illuminated or they call it perpetual

00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,329
illumination or something regions nearby

00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:54,849
and then probably send robots down into

00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:57,999
those craters yeah the spacesuits aren't

00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:59,380
designed for that kind of cold and so

00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:01,900
that it'll be a while before anybody

00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,609
goes down in one of those craters or any

00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,489
hardware it goes down there but the idea

00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:07,690
is to land nearby and then you're close

00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:10,180
enough that you can have your other

00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:13,210
assets bulldozers and such go down and

00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:15,779
bring back the water what I asked Daniel

00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:18,160
can you please says hitting up your yeah

00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:20,799
so you had a really cool thing I thought

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,809
the like the participation of hams like

00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:25,420
during the original Apollo mission so

00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:27,930
I'd be curious to know like will the

00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:30,249
Animus you know mission have any

00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:32,170
opportunity for hobbyists so you know

00:48:30,249 --> 00:48:34,119
enthusiasts just get involved you know

00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,249
just observe or you know what any any

00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:39,249
kind of an participation and maybe even

00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:40,839
something that we can you know I always

00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,700
say it was probably access experts here

00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:44,769
but we could maybe take elsewhere like

00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,940
into schools and you know something like

00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:49,119
that is there anything like that well

00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,650
you know that the started with with

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,930
shuttle the shuttle amateur radio

00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:54,700
experiment or SAR X and then on space

00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,519
station we have this amateur radio on

00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,930
ISS this has been very popular I think

00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,690
there are plans to put something like

00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,819
that on Gateway it won't be something

00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,249
you can use your 2 meter handy talkie

00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:08,170
to talk to over that distance I what

00:49:06,249 --> 00:49:10,029
I've heard it maybe x-band and it'd

00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,920
probably be some digital form of

00:49:10,029 --> 00:49:15,160
communications I don't know the details

00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,519
of that so that'll be specifically for

00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:21,069
amateurs I think the the comm system

00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:23,079
we're probably pretty similar to to

00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:24,819
what's used on Space Station now so

00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:27,130
that's probably kku band

00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:29,589
I know it's K band anyway and some a

00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:32,200
spend so I don't know how much hobbyist

00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:33,190
if Alma there can be there like there

00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,240
was back then where they could actually

00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:40,240
hear the signal but

00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,880
certainly there's there are plans for no

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,990
amateur radio on the gateway I haven't

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,089
heard anybody talk about amateur radio

00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:48,609
on the lunar module I think wait is it

00:49:46,089 --> 00:49:50,109
such a premium there that that's

00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:53,559
probably not gonna happen anytime soon

00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:55,030
but sometime it possibly could so I

00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:59,740
would love to have a repeater on the

00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:01,660
moon right so hi thanks for the talk so

00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,770
you're when you're talking about the

00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,839
gateway module notice one of your

00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:06,520
bullets was specifically about designing

00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:09,160
around and incorporating open

00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,750
architectures and frameworks which

00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,609
obviously this conference is all about a

00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,650
so I'm interested to hear a little bit

00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:17,109
more about that and what NASA's thoughts

00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:20,920
are and their role in the open-source

00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:23,670
community what I have seen so far it was

00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:27,430
not in the software area but it was

00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:29,890
they've got a set of standards that they

00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:32,559
put together for any hardware that goes

00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:34,780
to Gateway and those are open standards

00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,540
and that's like life support systems and

00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,069
and command and data handling and you

00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,440
know the type of Ethernet they're gonna

00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:43,599
use all that I think probably this

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,069
almost most of the software that's a

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,200
whole you know flight software and

00:50:45,069 --> 00:50:48,760
that's very rigidly controlled although

00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,680
I think aren't they using Linux on Space

00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,230
Station now I think I heard that some of

00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,089
the laptops maybe maybe I'm not positive

00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:59,200
about that don't quote me please

00:50:55,089 --> 00:51:01,869
but that's when I've heard I think that

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,480
bullet was addressing specifically those

00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:05,950
standards that were put out that are

00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,500
their kind of hardware standards

00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:09,819
primarily but I don't know that's that's

00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,520
a good question and that's something

00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:16,210
that we think about I'm not sure who to

00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:18,160
ask about that but I know that the the

00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:21,190
type of horsepower you have in the room

00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,440
here could really contribute to that you

00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:24,309
know the whole program and we need that

00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,140
kind of horsepower

00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:31,270
yeah I heard Nessa done some tests of

00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,680
high bandwidth communications using

00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:34,480
lasers can you speak to that a little

00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:37,059
bit yeah I don't know much about that I

00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,410
know that the ladee mission which I had

00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:40,569
some involvement with us a lunar

00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:44,170
atmosphere and dust environment Explorer

00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:46,150
I think it had a laser comm system and

00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:48,819
again I'm not a communications guy but I

00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:50,589
hear you know discussion of that and I

00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:52,539
know that they were talking about you

00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:54,130
looking at that for Gateway as well but

00:51:52,539 --> 00:51:56,049
I really don't know where that is right

00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:57,819
now I think it was successful for Landy

00:51:56,049 --> 00:51:59,229
if you look up the ladee mission you'd

00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:00,519
probably find some stuff on that but I

00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:03,700
think they had some really high data

00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:05,890
rates and very promising and especially

00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,539
space to space communication that's

00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:10,450
where it really shines I think because

00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:11,440
no pun intended because you don't need

00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:16,420
to worry about you know getting through

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,969
the atmosphere mining water resources on

00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:20,710
the moon what how common is this

00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:23,019
resource on the moon is it sustainable

00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:24,249
is it like reproducing itself somehow or

00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:26,109
is this something that's eventually

00:52:24,249 --> 00:52:29,680
going to run out yeah where it comes

00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:31,619
from is meteoroid impacts and that's

00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,539
something else that I do in my day job

00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:37,809
especially cometary material because

00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:40,779
there's a lot of water in that now these

00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:42,579
things are impacting between 10 and 70

00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:45,339
kilometres per second so a lot of it

00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:47,049
just goes away but there's there's

00:52:45,339 --> 00:52:48,940
enough of it they think the reason that

00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:51,249
we have that there is because of these

00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,809
impacts you get the some of the

00:52:51,249 --> 00:52:55,690
molecules kind of bouncing around the

00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:57,700
surface and these are cold traps that's

00:52:55,690 --> 00:53:00,489
a place where it's so cold that if a

00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:03,130
molecule gets in there it may stay and

00:53:00,489 --> 00:53:05,710
and so over billions of years you build

00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:07,569
up some of that yeah if we started

00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:09,130
mining it you know really fast I'm sure

00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:10,960
we'd use it all up and it'd be gone but

00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:13,299
I think it'd take a really long time to

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,190
do that there's it's not really well

00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:17,079
understood just how much is there and

00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:18,700
that's part of the reason for doing this

00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,670
research you know sending people there

00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:24,309
sitting robots down but from

00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:26,079
measurements of neutrons coming back up

00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:30,549
from the surface and then there's there

00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:32,979
was back in I think yes it was 2009 the

00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:35,529
L cross mission that was the upper stage

00:53:32,979 --> 00:53:37,690
that sent the Lunar Reconnaissance

00:53:35,529 --> 00:53:39,430
Orbiter to the moon they deliberately

00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:43,269
smashed it into one of these permanently

00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:47,170
shadowed craters and observed what came

00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:49,210
out of it from a little shepherding

00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:52,059
spacecraft from the earth and from LRO

00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:53,259
as well so we know that there's water

00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:54,819
there but I don't think they know

00:53:53,259 --> 00:53:58,269
exactly how much or maybe some other

00:53:54,819 --> 00:54:01,410
stuff there too but it's an area of

00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:01,410
active research for sure

00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:11,540
other questions like you thank you we

00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:13,250
have a reward for all like known

00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:15,130
speakers or you know it's bigger Ward in

00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,540
our keynote speaker challenger coin

00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:22,000
thank you very much for talking very

00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:22,000
