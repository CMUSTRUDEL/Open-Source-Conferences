Description: 
	Open Sourcing the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence by Steve Croft, Andrew Siemion, Ben Hilburn

Breakthrough Listen is a 10-year project that is driving an unprecedented expansion of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. New broadband digital instruments at some of the world’s most powerful radio telescopes are generating data streams that are being analyzed for technosignatures (signs of technology developed by intelligent life beyond the Earth). The project aims to make as much data and code openly available as possible, and recently announced the availability of around 1 PB of data in a public archive. Recent work in applying machine learning algorithms to the search has been very promising, and we seek to engage and collaborate with RF and ML experts to develop novel approaches to expand the search. Work is also underway to convert datasets into formats in more common use in the GNURadio community, and a recent hackathon, held in collaboration with the SETI Institute, at the Allen Telescope Array resulted in progress on integrating radio telescopes as sources into the GNURadio infrastructure. I will report on the goals, challenges, progress, and potential of the search for the answer to one of humanity’s most profound questions: Are we alone in the Universe?

okay yeah thanks Martin I think last

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,380
year when I spoke at this convention I

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,369
began my talk by saying something like

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,570
and now for something completely

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,270
different

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,860
it's really actually great that it's not

00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,630
quite so different as it was last year

00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,890
as Martin was saying there's been a lot

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,600
of discussion that's been happening

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,059
there's also been a lot of great work

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,470
that's been going on with some folks

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,000
from the canoe radio community in

00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,879
collaboration with the SETI Institute

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,110
and with breakthrough listen so for

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,220
those of you who won air last year I

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,170
would like to give you a little bit of

00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,460
background on how we actually do the

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,620
kind of searches that we're doing some

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,130
of the equipment that we're using and

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,090
some of the the algorithms Thanks

00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,680
but I'd also like to highlight

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,210
opportunities for people in this

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,770
audience to get involved it's a great

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,059
range of skills here we've already had

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,469
as I say kind of quite a lot of

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,270
involvement I really want to kind of

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,970
give a big shout out to Ben he'll burn

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,160
in particular into the mic Piscopo who

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,630
Mike in particular who came back out to

00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,250
the Allen telescope array to work with

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,110
some of the undergrads out there this

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,640
summer but also to all the other people

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,649
who came to the hackathon who've been

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,050
working on modules for new radio that

00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:20,880
are going to help really hopefully give

00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,470
you access to some exciting hardware to

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,319
some exciting data that we've been

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,050
taking and also maybe help us make what

00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,119
we think is one of the most profound

00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,940
discoveries in science

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,110
so as Marcin mentioned I'm based at UC

00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,700
Berkeley at the UC Berkeley City

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,740
Research Center I'm also affiliated with

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,330
the SETI Institute as is my boss dr.

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,130
Andrew Simeon who is the principal

00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,140
investigator on the breakthrough listen

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,580
project which I'll get to later in the

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,560
talk but breakthrough listen has really

00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,179
revolutionized the search for

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,599
intelligent life beyond Earth in the

00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:50,599
last few years

00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:59,759
okay so obviously you're all familiar

00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,080
with the the rtl-sdr hardware we've

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,759
really had fun playing around with this

00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,140
with some of our undergrads and kind of

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,440
getting them a little bit more hands-on

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,450
I mean I I did my undergrad at my PhD

00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,950
really pretty much as an end user if the

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,390
instruments you know you sort of point

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,410
at something and then data comes out the

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,360
back end and it's a little bit of a

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,150
black box so it's been kind of really

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,250
cool to get our undergrads a little bit

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,720
more engaged with looking at some of the

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,829
hardware and really what we're doing

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,030
with the kind of experiments that we're

00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:27,510
doing which again I'm going to get to in

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,819
a little bit is scaling this up just

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,980
more bandwidth more sensitivity really

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:35,040
trying to maximize the amount of data

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,980
that we can take in in pursuit of this

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,420
search little antennas I'll show you

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,819
some bigger antennas than this a little

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,530
bit later on in the talk but the data

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,659
really looks pretty similar to what you

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,519
get if you fire up something like GQ rx

00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:48,629
these waterfowl plots so I think most of

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
you are familiar with this where you

00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:52,709
have frequency on the horizontal axis

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,940
and then time scrolling down on the

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,560
vertical axis and the intensity

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,120
represented as the colors here and

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,620
there's a lot of signals out there it

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,540
turns out that there's a lot of hardware

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,040
particularly in a room like this I think

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,260
this probably sort of a higher density

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,450
of RF signals in this room than there

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,920
would be in pretty much any other place

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,989
with this number of people in it given

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,590
the audience here but there's a lot of

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:15,150
transmitters that are transmitting

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,519
information between themselves and to

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,250
base stations and you know modern life

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,950
really is full of these transmitters and

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,090
really the idea that motivates the the

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,560
SETI search is the search for

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,720
extraterrestrial intelligence as well if

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,129
there's life elsewhere maybe they've

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,260
developed technology too and so actually

00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,730
we've come up with this term Jill tarter

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,810
who's one of the pioneers in the field I

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,430
think has really been promoting this

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,199
idea of TechKnow signatures which again

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,239
I'm going to get to in a little bit but

00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,949
it's the idea that you could look for

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,480
signatures of technology and people

00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,459
sometimes come along and they say well

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,780
you know what if their technology is you

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,660
know tachyons or what if their

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,400
technology is subspace communicators or

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,489
whatever and my response to that really

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,780
is well if you can design a subspace

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,180
detector then we'll put it on the

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,190
telescope but until then we're really

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,410
kind of motivated by the idea that an

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,879
advanced civilization may still choose

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,290
for very good reasons I think that

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,269
probably I don't need to explain to many

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,099
people in this room they still choose to

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,230
use radio for some of their

00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,299
communications or maybe actually to make

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,879
their presence known to other folks like

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,590
us that are out there looking for them

00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:20,099
so again a lot of technology that's out

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,800
here a lot of devices that are

00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:24,419
communicating with each other a lot of

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
frequencies that are in use across the

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,479
spectrum it used to be that astronomy

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,280
use just a few little very narrow

00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,659
reserve bands but now we have these wide

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,550
bandwidth detectors and we have to

00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:34,830
contend with the fact that there are all

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:38,610
of these devices that are using regions

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,229
of the spectrum and you know we don't

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,950
know if they are out there we don't know

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,090
which free

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,350
and sees they might be transmitting on

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,700
again we don't know whether they're they

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,530
might be using radio but we actually

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,880
really just feel like we have to go out

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,050
and do the experiment right we can sit

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,590
here and talk about this or we can

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,820
actually go out and gather some data so

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,330
I want to take you back so to half a

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,490
millennium when there were seven planets

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,110
interestingly including the Sun and the

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,730
moon these were the classical planets

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,710
that moved across the sky but of course

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,390
500 years ago the beginning of the

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,370
modern scientific revolution in

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,350
astronomy the realization that there was

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,120
empirical evidence that the Sun was the

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,980
center of our solar system that the moon

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,210
was a satellite that was orbiting the

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,160
Earth and that the other planets were

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,750
planets that were just like our own

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,520
obviously the figures like Galileo and

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,590
Copernicus that were really very

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,180
instrumental in this and I guess you

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,250
know the term instrumental actually also

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,690
applies to the fact that they were among

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,700
the first scientists to really use

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,380
modern scientific instruments to

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,480
actually understand our place in the

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,490
universe to use the telescope telescopes

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,570
of course have been developed in the 500

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:42,150
years since but this is really you know

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,830
a paradigm shift our realizing that

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,530
we're not at the center of things are

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,200
realizing that we're not maybe all that

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,600
special or maybe we are but at least the

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,580
history of scientific observation in

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,170
astronomy has shown us that when we

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,400
think we're kind of an outlier that when

00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,200
we think we're unusual we actually

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,150
realize we're not we're on an average

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,490
planet going around an average star in

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,710
an average galaxy and maybe the average

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,160
world in our galaxy is also inhabited

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,930
and in fact Giordano Bruno SIA statue of

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,870
him here in Rome was burnt at the stake

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,970
in 1600 for daring to suggest as the

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,640
Roman Inquisition said in their summary

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:20,190
of the trial that there were many worlds

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,620
many Suns necessarily containing similar

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,660
things in kind and in species is in this

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,200
world and even men so this was really a

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,150
heresy back then a little over 400 years

00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,350
ago but it's still a question that we

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,170
don't have the answer to all these

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,990
worlds out there inhabited one of the

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:39,750
things that we do know now that has

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,810
changed where I'm supposed to pointless

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,460
but in the intervening period and

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,230
particularly in the last 30 years right

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,760
is that we've discovered planets outside

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,620
our own solar system there were no

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,290
planets when I was in elementary school

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,790
there were nine planets and I apologize

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,710
to those of you who were offended that

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,500
so got demoted I didn't have anything to

00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,700
do with that but in exchange for sort of

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,950
switching to eight in our solar system

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,440
the astronomical community has

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,000
discovered thousands of planets outside

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,400
our solar system and really the

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,620
implication is that there are perhaps

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,180
hundreds of billions of planets just in

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,310
our own galaxy and we're not at the

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,570
stage yet where we know if any of those

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,640
are inhabited but that's the next thing

00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,900
that we want to try and find out there

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,240
are some of those systems where there

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,620
are multiple small rocky worlds that are

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,150
in the sort of temperate zone in the

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,110
habitable zone around their style where

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,460
the temperatures might be right for

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,690
liquid water to exist on the surface

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,400
here's one example

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,580
artist's impression of the trampa Swan

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,650
system but again there's hundreds of

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,090
billions of stars in our galaxy and the

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,770
results from missions like the Kepler

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,570
spacecraft has shown us in the last few

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,970
years that pretty much every star in the

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,560
sky has at least one planet going around

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,120
it and maybe something like twenty or

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,070
thirty percent of those stars have these

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,950
small habitable planets going around

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,210
them their emissions that are in the

00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,280
pipeline that are going to look for bio

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,690
signatures things like the James Webb

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,430
Space Telescope and some of the big

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,560
30-minute class telescopes that are

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,350
being built on the ground that might be

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,240
able to look for signs of biological

00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,450
processes and atmospheres may be looking

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,350
as you see in these infrared spectra

00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,020
here on the left

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,360
comparing earth with Venus and Mars you

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,880
can see water vapor you can see ozone

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,380
you can see other signs of biology of

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,740
non-equilibrium chemistry in the

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,300
atmospheres of planets and again sort of

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,400
by extension from this the idea that we

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,950
might be able to remote sense signs of

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,290
biology maybe we could also remote sense

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,670
signs of technology this this slide is

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,740
just to illustrate really that the

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,240
remote sensing biology is hard because

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,280
the light of a planet compared to the

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,780
light of a star is very faint you have a

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,020
real contrast issue it's like looking

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,000
for a fire flying next to a searchlight

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,470
but in certain wave bands in certain

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,840
radio wave bands in particular in a

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,820
narrow band the earth actually outshines

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,590
the Sun at radio wavelengths so we don't

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,150
have this contrast issue there's still a

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,430
sensitivity issue you still need big

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,890
dishes but these techno signatures some

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,720
of them are at least in principle

00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,670
detectable over interstellar distances

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,140
or some of our brightest transmitters

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,880
and particularly some of our most

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,700
directional transmitters things like the

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,329
Arecibo radar big dish in Puerto Rico if

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,480
you pointed that at a

00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:12,040
analog dish under sort of favourable

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,689
circumstances you could pick that up to

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:19,540
a few hundred light years away from us

00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:22,389
the one of the seminal papers in the

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,549
field actually at 60th anniversary is

00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:26,769
coming up tomorrow this paper in nature

00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:27,850
bank account Ian Morrison which really

00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:29,529
did some of these sort of back of the

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,949
envelope calculations of the feasibility

00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:35,439
of doing a radio SETI search and then

00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:36,850
that the following year young astronomer

00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:38,439
Frank Drake many of you will probably be

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,149
familiar with the Drake Equation used

00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:42,579
the telescope at Green Bank with one

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:45,189
single sterile Channel Frank looked at

00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:47,589
two stars and he searched through those

00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:49,269
with just the loudspeaker hooked up to

00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:51,459
the output he heard some kind of weird

00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,629
sounds coming out which he later figured

00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:54,910
out I think at least one of them was an

00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:56,739
airplane going past the first example of

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,269
the thing that we struggle with still

00:09:56,739 --> 00:10:00,309
it's the radio frequency interference

00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:02,290
from all of the devices that we have

00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,449
ourselves as a human species this

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,160
motivates the search but it also really

00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:08,470
hampers the search because you have to

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,290
listen through this den of devices to

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,579
try and pick up something that would be

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,929
coming from interstellar distances and

00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,100
hence even if the transmitter is very

00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:16,689
luminous than the signal that you're

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,899
gonna pick up it's going to be very very

00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:22,059
faint Mike Garrett that director of the

00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,069
Jodrell Bank Observatory in the UK has

00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:25,899
sort of parameter parameterised this

00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:28,209
multi-dimensional haystack that we have

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,249
to search through to succeed in this so

00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:32,860
you have things like spatial resolution

00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:35,350
field of view sensitivity or depth

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,029
bandwidth polarization temporal

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,169
resolution and frequency resolution and

00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:40,239
then there's the actual signal type

00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:42,730
there's data processing

00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:45,399
maybe AI and machine learning in pursuit

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,019
of signal recognition so even if you can

00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,850
maximize if you have a big dish and you

00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,019
can go very sensitive and even and we'll

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,309
the problem with a big dish is that

00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,049
you're compromising on field of view

00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:54,519
there's a lot of kind of sliders that

00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:57,999
you have to move around basically that

00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,980
are going to be have to be optimized in

00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:01,749
order to do the kind of search that

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,949
you're interested in but even having all

00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:04,720
of that data you still have to be able

00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:07,119
to recognize the signal when it's in

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,889
there so we're sort of digging around in

00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:10,059
this haystack we we're not even sure

00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,919
that there's a needle in there or what

00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:16,600
the needle might look like but we have

00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:19,059
some ideas so in 2015 the breakthrough

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,439
prize Foundation announced the launch of

00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,840
the breakthrough listen project 100

00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,790
million

00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,230
over ten years to really accelerate the

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,420
search for extraterrestrial intelligence

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,390
there's a lot of media interests my boss

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,130
Andrew sent me off to do the Fox

00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,540
Business interview where I think they

00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,760
were interested in the 100 million

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,080
figure and sort of didn't really have a

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,880
clue about the science so there were

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,980
some nice graphics of like the lunar

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,940
rover or an astronauts in orbit and sort

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,760
of things that really were not very

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,870
germane to to the subject and the

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,700
interviewers asking me what my the

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,500
aliens look like and I was sort of

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,240
tempted to say well you know they might

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,590
look a little bit like you waving your

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,090
arms around like now I don't know but

00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:59,060
you know we really want to actually

00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,620
bring the the scientific approach to the

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,150
search we don't just want to speculate

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,490
we don't want to put our tinfoil hats on

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,860
we want to take a lot of data and we

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,100
want to see what we can do with it we

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,020
are taking a lot of data the telescopes

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,070
in the top row are the primary observing

00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,630
facilities right now for a breakthrough

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,160
listen the hundred-meter Green Bank

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,950
telescope in West Virginia it's the

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,380
largest movable dish in the world and

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,760
essentially after the sarcophagus that

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,050
they slid in over the remains of the

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,560
Chernobyl nuclear reactor it's the

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,360
second largest movable structure on land

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,830
the Parkes telescope in Australia which

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,840
was used for receiving some of the

00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,180
transmissions from the Apollo missions

00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,400
the Mercat telescope in South Africa

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,200
which is one of the precursor telescopes

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,490
of the Square Kilometre Array and then

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,960
we have an optical search that's going

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,600
on with the automated planet finder at

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,010
Lick Observatory in California in the

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
next row you see I mentioned Jodrell

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,360
Bank that's the biggest dish in the UK

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,680
the fast telescope in China a new dish

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,030
which is the largest in the world

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,250
although it's not it's terrible it's

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,170
built into this cast depression in the

00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,580
mountains and then we just announced the

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,380
launch of a search using Barrett's house

00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,670
which is pretty interesting optical

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,620
telescope essentially

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,420
strangely looking for gamma-ray sources

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,920
as gamma rays hit the upper atmosphere

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,290
but we may use it to look for bright

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,150
optical pulses and then at the bottom

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,500
you see some of these aperture arrays

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,840
these sort of new generation of

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,480
telescopes where we're replacing the

00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,670
large amounts of steel in something like

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,140
the Green Bank telescope with silicon on

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,410
the backend and actually doing things

00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,090
like

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,780
phasing things up doing beamforming

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,820
doing correlation and replacing sort of

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,380
these large dishes with electronic

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,880
methods that allow us to get the

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,620
collecting area and resolution and

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,400
sensitivity that we want

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,410
so there's the green main telescope

00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,330
again that's our chief engineer Dave my

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,220
mom for scale you can see some folks who

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,110
repelled down from painting the on the

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,610
side of the dish they're just about make

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,870
them out and some trucks in the

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,890
foreground for scale it's a really

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,750
pretty impressive piece of engineering

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,880
you can actually go and visit the site

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,800
they have some tours actually that also

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,450
specifically include some of the work

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,270
that we're doing there it's kind of fun

00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:00,770
and it's in the National Radio quiet

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:03,510
zone a few hours west of Washington DC

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,700
this few papers here that talk about the

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,740
infrastructure that we built so there's

00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,660
fast compute clusters that are deployed

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,250
at both the Parkes telescope and the

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,279
Green Bank and then the third reference

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,480
there is to the data archiving which

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,740
we're doing we don't have a better

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,589
petabyte at the public data that's

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,270
available and we have now with the

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,950
system at Green Bank 12 gigahertz of

00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,680
instantaneous bandwidth we have about 8

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:28,100
petabytes of storage on site and we're

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,420
streaming data to disk it really kind of

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,339
honestly unmanageable rates I mean to

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,040
the extent we're right now we're just

00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,600
archiving the the waterfall plots were

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,360
archiving essentially just the total

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:44,580
power information with some compromised

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,770
resolution and time resolution and that

00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,529
you know we have the IQ data we have the

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,120
raw data that's coming in and we're sort

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:52,500
of scaling up to be able to do analysis

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,209
on the raw data but right now the focus

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,010
of most of what of what we're doing is

00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,990
on these waterfall plots is on the IQ

00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,130
data and we have some of those we have

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,560
some of the raw data publicly available

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:04,529
we also have some of the IQ data

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,240
publicly available the files are big but

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,890
the saris that the raw data and the IQ

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,770
we have the waterfall plots available as

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,450
well including some in CMF format and

00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,160
and that's pretty easy there's tools as

00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,870
well and it'll enable you to load that

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,830
into Python and to actually look at some

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,910
of the signals that we're picking up

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,470
I'll skip over this in the interest of

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,480
time but we have different frequency and

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,600
time resolutions that we generate in

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,339
terms of these waterfall plot data and

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,540
this is may be of interest to some folks

00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,190
in the room here and then where there

00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,839
are many of you has anybody heard of

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,070
Casper the collaboration for astronomy

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,300
signal processing and engineering

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,089
research couple of folks in the bank

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,670
here may be radio astronomers so Casper

00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:43,380
is essentially using commercial

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,470
off-the-shelf hardware rather than doing

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,540
sort of bespoke interconnects doing

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,250
sort of designing instruments that are

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,440
just specific to the experiment that you

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,790
want to do Kasper basically tries to get

00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,709
everything into Ethernet packets as

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,300
quickly as you can so this is the snap

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:00,149
board which is the latest iteration to

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,470
the boards that that digitizes and then

00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:04,500
actually kind of run stuff through the

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,329
FPGA and outputs the data that you're

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,920
interested in and so this is kind of

00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:09,000
another interesting open source project

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,139
that some of you might want to check out

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,480
some of you may even want to get on the

00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,250
cat super mailing list and kind of

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,500
potentially you know see what's going on

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:21,779
there so as I mentioned we get waterfall

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,209
plots out this is just a waterfall plot

00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:26,100
of five minutes of data or 180 7.5

00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:27,720
megahertz of bandwidth for one of the

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,149
nodes in our compute cluster at Green

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,220
Bank and you can see there's some kind

00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,449
of squiggles in here some signals the

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,430
vertical lines are just part of the

00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:39,720
filter Bank basically that where we're

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:41,250
using here and again sort of we don't

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,350
think we picked up et we think that we

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:46,139
picked up a bunch of other things of our

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,629
own devices but there's one way that we

00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,800
can actually use a spatial filter to try

00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:51,300
and discriminate against some of that

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,519
local interference and it's because the

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,230
beam of the Green Bank telescope because

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,480
it's a hundred meters and your

00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,790
resolution your your width of that beam

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,139
goes as wavelength divided about that by

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,060
the diameter of the dish so with a

00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,579
hundred meter dish you have something

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,319
like a tenth of a degree resolution on

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,600
the sky so you point this thing pretty

00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,949
precisely and then you can actually nod

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,850
on and off the target that you're

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:17,039
interested in so here's that waterfall

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,449
plot again here's an off pointing so we

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,770
move to a nearby pointing about a degree

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:24,299
away and then we do on off on off on off

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,589
in three pairs of observations it's at

00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,730
the top row here is what were actually

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,039
pointed at the star that we're

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,049
interested in the bottom row is when

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,820
we're pointed at a neighboring star

00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,590
that's not our primary target and

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,090
essentially the search amounts to just

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:39,210
look for things that are in the top row

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,530
that are absent in the bottom row and

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,240
for those of you who are kind of

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,620
carefully paying attention here you can

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,809
probably see there's something at about

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,730
2.4 gigahertz which is probably I'm

00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,350
assuming somebody who's ignored the

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,450
signs around the telescope saying please

00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,240
turn off your cellphone and turn off

00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:57,070
your Wi-Fi so we picked that up whether

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,870
we're pointed at the star or not

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,010
we'd like to be able to draw boxes

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,240
around these and actually figure out

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,850
what they are we've been chatting with

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,519
Ben and folks at deep saying about smart

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,929
ways of doing this I kind of really hope

00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,220
that et is actually doing something like

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:10,539
this so they might be sort of

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,010
transmitting something that really looks

00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:13,240
anomalous that looks like an outlier

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,679
that we might be able to pick up

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,600
although actually our current algorithms

00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,460
would probably miss even sort of weird

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,659
shapes like this but that's pretty

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,890
obviously you know something that's

00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:22,600
happening like that when we're pointed

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:26,080
at the star we'd want to go back and

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,570
look at that star again there's a lot of

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,010
satellites overhead I mention this and

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,269
their workshop that Mike ran yesterday

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,350
this is a nice free software called

00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:34,419
Stellarium where you can actually

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,830
visualize satellites that are overhead

00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:37,899
but we also have some undergrads that

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,299
have been working with us who have been

00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:42,669
doing satellite pass prediction and here

00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:44,799
you can see a GPS satellite the distance

00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:46,240
on the left hand plots of these GPS

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,679
satellites during the five minutes of

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,059
the observation and then the

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,380
corresponding waterfall plots on the

00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,000
right and you can see there's some clear

00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,710
correspondence between the satellite

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,580
that was going over and the interference

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,950
that we're getting were actually getting

00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,240
FFT over flow and the bottom plot here

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,779
and this is kind of bleeding out into

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,830
the neighboring channels there so I

00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:04,600
mentioned this about a petabyte to

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,500
public beta that's available both

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,889
spectrograms

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,529
and some IQ data we have results that

00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:13,960
were presented from our analysis of 1300

00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:16,000
nearby stars that are on this website

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,860
which you can go look at later we're

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,840
beginning to look at neighboring

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,059
galaxies that's sort of what's coming up

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,559
next for the program at Green Bank so

00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:26,440
here you're looking at things that are

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,990
you know maybe a hundred thousand times

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,690
further away then the star sample and so

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,399
the transmitters here would have to be

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,169
basically ten to the ten times as bright

00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:36,549
but then if you think of the scale of a

00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:38,230
galaxy and if you're familiar with the

00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:40,210
Kardashev scale some of you probably are

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,220
that actually corresponds to the

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,440
difference between a civilization that's

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,600
using all of the energy from its parent

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,039
star type to civilization to a

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,659
civilization that's using all of the

00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,250
energy from its entire galaxy a type

00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:53,049
three civilization and so we're actually

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,440
kind of interestingly sort of

00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:58,059
coincidentally sensitive to these these

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,190
different scales over galactic distances

00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:02,169
and so we hope to be able to put some

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,399
limits or I mean hopefully a detection

00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:05,380
but at least some limits on the

00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:09,159
prevalence of civilized civilizations

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,899
like this too I'm gonna skip this just

00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,039
in the interest of time

00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:16,389
this was some graphics that we had

00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,399
corresponding this went out with a press

00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:20,889
release about using a machine learning

00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:22,779
algorithm to find fast radio bursts so

00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:24,549
fast radio bursts of these weird bright

00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:26,409
bursts that we still don't know what the

00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:28,960
origins of them are some people have

00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:31,210
suggested maybe it's C T and I think it

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,340
is I think you know aliens should never

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,509
be your first thing that you run to they

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,399
should be so the last thing when you

00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:38,769
roll everything out but they're pretty

00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:41,409
interesting in particular because they

00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:44,409
actually sort of stand in as proxies for

00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:46,330
these sort of bright bright bursts maybe

00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,889
brief in time or narrow in frequency

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,869
that we're hoping to detect with these

00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:52,240
algorithms so we had a grad student

00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:53,980
working with us who did some work using

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,580
machine learning algorithms particularly

00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,259
CN NS to try and detect these nobody

00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,610
actually figured out I don't think and

00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,350
maybe this audience that would be good

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,850
for to draw this to your attention if

00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,590
there's a kind of secret code that's

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,269
hidden in this image you might want to

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,509
go have a look at that at some point

00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:15,070
later so this is what he found basically

00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:16,179
the ones in red I think were the ones

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,769
that were missed by the classical

00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:19,960
algorithm and so he's finding bursts

00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:21,999
that were that were coming from this

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,340
source from a source called FR b12 1102

00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:28,029
that were missed by the existing

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,799
analysis and which his CNM was able to

00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:32,850
pick out so some interesting sort of

00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:34,990
machine learning applications here

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,730
there's also some work going on with

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,850
anomaly detection again the same student

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:42,360
here so there's some real data on the

00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,710
left and this is each each individual

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,379
sort of pair or I guess there's like

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,389
five rectangles here five pairs of

00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:52,929
individual rectangles on the left five

00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:56,320
pairs on the right and these are laser

00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:57,940
here so you have an on observation and

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,779
an off observation then another on and

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,249
off and on and off on and off on and off

00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:05,019
and Jerry here did some work that was

00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:06,519
basically doing forward predictions this

00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:07,720
is simulated data on the right he's

00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,639
predicting what you should see in the

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,460
off based on what you saw and they on

00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:13,929
and in the fourth line here you can see

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,879
he predicts that this signal in the on

00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:17,980
observation should continue in the off

00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:19,330
observation it doesn't actually do so in

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,649
the real data and so these are the kind

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,539
of anomalies that we're looking for a

00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:24,600
way you might be able to compare real

00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:25,950
and simulated and say out

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,390
looks different so that's maybe kind of

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,820
something that we might flank as a

00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:34,260
candidate how long do I have Mawson

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,340
there's a couple minutes okay here's a

00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,500
detection of extraterrestrial

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,560
intelligence this is one of the Voyager

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,030
spacecraft so it's unfortunately our

00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,620
extraterrestrial intelligence but you

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,020
can go find this in some of the data

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:49,440
files that we have online it's really

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,570
kind of fun how you can zoom in from you

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,460
know a dataset like this and then

00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:57,480
actually see the the carrier and the

00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,850
data signals here play with that there's

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,440
again you can look at this slide that

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,150
closer but there's kind of a brief intro

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,170
that I wrote about sort of some of the

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,490
background that I've kind of really

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,630
whizzed through too fast here and this

00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,630
talk how we actually go about doing

00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:12,300
these searches on Monday we had an

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,980
announcement about the upgrade it's the

00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,140
Allen telescope array so some of you

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,240
we're out at our hackathon at the ACA

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,830
and we're hoping to do this again next

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,050
year get some new radio folks out there

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,370
really gonna get hands-on with this and

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,570
then there is actually you know some

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,760
software that's come out of that that

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:30,810
enables you to read data from this array

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:34,050
into into commit radio some data that's

00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:37,290
available there in siga math format and

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:39,960
then as as was already announced here

00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,550
next year the new radio conference is

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,550
gonna be co-sponsored by the SETI

00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:46,080
Institute breakthrough in Berkeley City

00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,910
we have undergraduate internships if you

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,290
are an undergrad or no undergrads you

00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,910
might like to come and work with us for

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,860
a paid internship during the summer we

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,780
also are trying to ramp up by hiring

00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,460
particularly with the ATA as a result of

00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,150
this extra funding that's come in from

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,350
franklin antonio so keep an eye out for

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,460
that if you want to join our slack

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,930
there's a number of people in this room

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,980
who are already on slack here we're

00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,940
talking through some of these things

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,700
you're welcome to do so

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,250
also some outreach stuff Jim Shea was

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,840
kind enough to come to an event in

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,250
London where we were demoing some of

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,700
this stuff in the context of the SETI

00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,560
search more educational stuff you know

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,140
that's going on I mentioned already the

00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,550
work that Mike is doing and just to

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,850
finish and apologies again for sort of

00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:28,500
the whirlwind tour of this but

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,330
celebrating this anniversary tomorrow of

00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,730
this this paper by keone and Morris and

00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,900
then that paper by saying basically we

00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,630
don't know what our chances of success

00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,720
are but if we don't search the chance of

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:47,560
success is zero

00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:49,770
Thanks we do have time for one or two

00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,770
questions

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:57,120
you had mentioned simulation do you

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,900
simulate the whole 12 gigahertz

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:04,060
bandwidth no so Jerry Dara was taking

00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,200
little chunks and basically so there's

00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,570
there's two things that we've don't want

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,800
is just inserting simulated signals and

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,330
then seeing how well we can retrieve

00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,100
them and the other is just concentrating

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,350
on small regions of the spectrum with

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,870
signals in so that 12 gigahertz is

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,700
mostly uninteresting I mean depending on

00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:21,250
the sensitivity thresholds that you set

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,860
you can extract potentially millions of

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,720
signals from from there so the bandwidth

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,460
that's a lot of channels that are just

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,810
full of noise and we want to just ignore

00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:34,270
those basically and do simple energy

00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:39,840
detection on them okay no hands up so

00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:39,840
