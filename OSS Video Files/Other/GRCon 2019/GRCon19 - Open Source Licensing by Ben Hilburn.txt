Description: 
	Open Source Licensing by Ben Hilburn

Learn the basics of open-source licensing and how it works! This is not a presentation that discusses what open-source is or it’s benefits, but rather some of the stickier and more complex details of licensing that sometimes arise when using and publishing open-source projects (like GNU Radio!). Have you ever wondered if there is a license requirement for GNU Radio Out-of-Tree Modules you’ve published? Or how the GPL works with FPGA code? At the end of this presentation, you should be able to answer questions like these without Fear, Uncertainty, or Doubt!

let's do it okay so this is going I want

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,390
this to be mostly interactive I usually

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,430
for the last two years I've given an

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,500
hour-long workshop on this topic which

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,450
is just the fire hose of information so

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,000
my goal here is to try to reduce the

00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,829
fire hose but still provide enough

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,590
information that it's this is useful and

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,760
hopefully really interesting so if you

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,980
have questions while I'm giving my talk

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,630
please just like raise your hand and if

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,660
I make the point I'll reach out and call

00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:48,020
on you so there's kind of a question

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,250
first of all I say I am NOT a lawyer

00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,480
this is my disclaimer it applies to

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,630
everything I'm going to say for the next

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,270
half hour if you know what's good for

00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,790
you you can ignore everything I say and

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,130
you really should not repeat any of this

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,799
and all of you have probably have your

00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,930
own internal legal counsels even when I

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,470
think they are wrong you they are right

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,960
for you

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,229
that's why that's my disclaimer so given

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,020
that why are we doing this

00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:20,240
so lawyers are there to reduce are they

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,560
ting ways in the room no okay okay

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,220
most lawyers are there to reduce risk

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,870
and liability right that is not always

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,310
in line with you being successful that's

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,990
not their job their job is not to make

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,590
you successful their job is to protect

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,600
the liability of the company and even 25

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,670
years after the creation open-source

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,350
there's still substantial

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,700
misunderstanding and FUD fear

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,150
uncertainty and doubt about what this

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,549
all means so the point of this talk is

00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,900
to give you enough information that if

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,310
you're trying to do something an open

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,830
source you want to publish code you want

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,350
to use code and someone tells you no you

00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,580
can't do that for reasons x and y but

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,390
maybe you have just enough information

00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:07,200
to think wait that doesn't sound right

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,310
and dig into it further so first I've

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
heard of what people fill out the survey

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,480
that I sent out with five questions

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,980
first one if you modify your Ito code

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,930
within your company the GPL requires you

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,530
to then release that code to the public

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,379
so we got 3/4 saying that is not true

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,239
25% saying it's true this is indeed

00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,250
false

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,670
we'll talk we'll dive into the GPL

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,470
specifically within the talk but if you

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,959
have got a radio you're using it

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,819
internally and you do not give your new

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,770
radio based code to someone outside of

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:43,560
your company and for purposes of the

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,150
license that includes anybody that is

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,670
consulting for you it includes across

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,650
teams within a company there's no

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,780
obligation to share source anybody false

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,880
question to if you create a greater out

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,610
of tree module and publish it to github

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,519
and must be licensed under the GPL so gr

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:06,180
spec guest for example does that have to

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,430
be licensed as GPL in order to use it

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:13,170
you have to link it against guna radio

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:16,290
right the answer is actually false you

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,569
do not have to license your inner radio

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,040
auditory modules as the GPL you must

00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,810
license you're going to radiography

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,709
modules with a license that is

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:28,200
compatible with the GPL because the code

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,239
has a standalone thing it might not be

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,400
usable without being radio but it is its

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,470
own thing so it does not become GPL

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,079
licensed until someone actually uses it

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,750
with can your Pio at that point the GPL

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,160
applies so and there's actually a number

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,660
of getting ready out of treat modules

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:49,170
that you'll see that for example under

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:51,630
or under an apache license as good

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,810
question so there is actually a list of

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,000
GPL v3 which is what we are compatible

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,290
licenses on the pre software

00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,459
foundation's website and on wikipedia

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,670
actually which is where I would

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,709
recommend going and it'll tell you like

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,560
these are the licenses that we have

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:11,069
deemed to be compatible and as they are

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,440
the stewards of the GPL pretty much what

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,750
they say goes and your legal counsels

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,039
should I mean every little council I've

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,829
ever heard of that said if this is what

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:22,440
they say I'll go with it

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,570
good question question three you've

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,720
executed a copyright assignment organ

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,190
your radio and you submit that code you

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,160
then cannot use it elsewhere

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:35,190
or on very different license so as an

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,120
example if someone were to write a

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,169
polyphase channel Iser and they submit

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,789
it to beginner radio

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:43,800
such that they get sup streamed are they

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:46,110
allowed to use that polyphase channel

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:52,969
Iser code and a proprietary product

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:55,590
separate from gonna radio the answer is

00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:58,650
false I don't then my circle just change

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:03,749
yes well it's the wrong circle but it's

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,300
about the same so that's the 60% got

00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:09,060
this one wrong

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,099
the when you will board this a little

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,529
bit more when you submit code to gainer

00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:16,199
radio you are indeed giving up ownership

00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:17,639
of that code but you are granted back a

00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,800
license to do anything you want with it

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,949
including using it proprietary products

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,389
there is no risk of submitting DSP code

00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:30,449
to gain radio and then not being able to

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:32,279
use it elsewhere what's before I'll get

00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,779
into that too yeah all right question

00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,779
for if a court rules that you have

00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:39,060
violated the GPL it can force you to

00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,849
release that code the codes are you're

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,520
violating software this one was really

00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:45,629
interesting me this is circled I grabbed

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,240
a circle this morning it's actually

00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:50,639
closer to full 75% now said that this is

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,990
true that a court can force you to

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,419
release source code this is indeed false

00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,120
the court cannot force you to release

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,879
source code there's actually no

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,129
mechanism in US law for that to happen

00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,009
it's called a specific action and it

00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:10,430
does not that is not a thing where the

00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:12,949
court can force you to do is stop

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,479
infringing or stop violating the license

00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:17,430
so one of the ways you can stop

00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,169
violating a license is by releasing the

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,990
source code right that's just one way

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:24,180
your other option for example is to pay

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,729
for you pay penalties for your

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,830
infringement another option is to stop

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,930
using that code right so the court will

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,129
say you need to stop violating they

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,449
can't force you to release source code

00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,479
it just happens to be one of the ways

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:39,479
you can come out of violation last

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,779
question the GPL can be used for both in

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:46,139
radio source code and FPGA HDL such as

00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:49,019
ver log and VHDL so 70 percent said this

00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,659
is true about 30 percent said it's false

00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,340
I did not intentionally write this quiz

00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:57,180
to make every question false but

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,120
the answer is false and we're gonna dive

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:09,990
into this question in a lot more detail

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:11,250
because yeah I agree with what you said

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,950
and I have a kind of slide that'll go

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,350
into that further yeah so Robins point

00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:22,230
is this is subject to interpretation

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:25,020
this view is from the stewards of the

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,490
GPL and free software there are lawyers

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,970
that disagree and has never been proven

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,560
and I'll dive into that more in a minute

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,820
so there's three major types of

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,690
intellectual property copyright

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,130
trademark and patent the one that is you

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,700
the one that is used for software

00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:45,240
licensing is copyright

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,260
so we software like so in Mark

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,840
Shuttleworth mentioned this in his

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:54,240
keynote that the hack for open source

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,240
was turning sort of copyright on its

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,150
head to make the to use it for the

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,590
license free software so there's three

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,510
fundamental license clauses you'll see

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,790
and pretty much every open source

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,950
license the first is the right to do a

00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,090
bunch of things with it like use copy

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,740
modify merge published attribute

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,870
sublicense and/or sell copies of the

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,900
software that string is repeated

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,780
verbatim in many many licenses

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:23,070
specifically because those words have

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:25,380
explicit meaning under US law there's a

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,450
statement of notice so this usually says

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,430
something like if you use the software

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,160
you must preserve notice of the author

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,180
right so you can't incorporate even of

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,440
them but very brisk apply since it's

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,930
usually you can't incorporate that

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,180
software into your software and say or

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,550
in not say by the way this other person

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,530
wrote it right and the last one is

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,510
limitation of Liability a statement of

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,410
no warranty so this is like the thing

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,670
that's in all caps

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,870
it looks like it's yelling at you it's

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,760
like you know if you use the software

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,760
and somebody dies we're not responsible

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,050
for it this turns out to be a really big

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,180
deal for an important reason

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,400
so there's three major categories

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,730
open-source licenses strong copyleft

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,290
which is if you use this software the

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,540
license that this software is provided

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,310
under must be the license you use for

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,720
your software

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,160
we copy left which is if you use the

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,690
software Oh

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,089
as a fantastic typo the kiss component

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,050
must maintain its license but the rest

00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:21,300
of your software can be whatever you

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,160
want proprietary included and then come

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,660
permissive there's lots of flavours of

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,040
this but it's mostly do whatever you

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,649
want so I'm not going to this talk is

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,670
not about why open-source it's good and

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:34,770
why you should use it I don't have an

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,510
agenda of saying strong copyleft is

00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,240
better than permissive or vice versa one

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:43,230
thing I do want to point out is the word

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,570
open-source is not controlled people can

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,160
say such and such as open-source and

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,290
there is no one that can come in and say

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,620
that is not true

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,330
despite that open-source does have a

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,040
definition it's called the open source

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,420
definition as originally written as the

00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,640
Debian free software guidelines and then

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:05,209
turned into the OSD isn't maintained by

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:07,500
the OSI most IP counsel will use this

00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,480
people and companies that are new to

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,990
open-source are generally unaware of it

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,839
so what I'll say here is if someone says

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,690
or uses the term open source make sure

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,430
that you you guys are your party in that

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,410
party like you all all agree on what

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:26,520
that is so why does it matter because

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,899
open source a starter to show up in

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,920
contracts it shows up in statements of

00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:35,399
work it shows up in the AA's especially

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,500
since the 2018 NDAA section H which was

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:44,670
a major effort to push DoD for example

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:47,610
towards open source oh that's a that's

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,380
somebody trying to talk to me and open

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,589
source does not necessarily mean

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,510
copyleft so open source code does not

00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:57,660
necessarily mean you have to release

00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:00,810
your software as we said so Grady was

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,410
distributed under the GPL version 3 this

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,480
is a strong copyleft license which means

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,070
if you build something with cooter radio

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,440
and distribute it

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,959
that thing must also be GPL v3 which

00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,250
requires source release upon conveyance

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,600
conveyance is the key word here

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,870
conveyance as the word used in the

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,550
license conveyance is what triggers

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,530
distribution of source code

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,110
if you build a product with uni radio

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:27,270
when you convey that product to a

00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:31,380
customer that trigger source code

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:35,490
release now the bount there's a so the

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,930
question becomes okay where's where is

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,270
the boundary between what does GPL and

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,920
was not right your product probably has

00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,900
lots of different software in it right

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,510
so if you distribute a product that has

00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,370
green radio in it for example what

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,100
source code for the other software in

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,980
that product must be released right

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,730
so this is actually not been proven in

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,250
US courts

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,350
the general guideline that's recommended

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,070
is anything that has shared address

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:05,540
space in memory it's considered to be

00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:08,760
the boundary even that though is

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,640
confusing so for example a linux kernel

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,440
module can you write a Linux kernel

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,910
module like the latest kernels GPL can

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:21,110
you write a Linux kernel module that's

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:23,910
not GPL Linus Torvalds state says no

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:27,300
Nvidia says yes and that's why we have

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:29,400
binary NVIDIA blobs so this is still

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,620
generally an open question what's

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,730
recommended usually is to consider

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,410
shared address space the boundary copy

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,930
writing your code you automatically own

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,480
the copyright all you have you do not

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,600
even have to use this copyright line you

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,370
should anything you produce is

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,350
automatically copyrighted

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,180
everyone likes by the way adding all

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,250
rights reserved everything they produce

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,320
that phrase is meaningless it's been

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,060
meaningless since 1987 you're welcome to

00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,550
continue using it no lawyer cares about

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:04,650
it so copyright is Simoncini radio

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,750
diving this a little bit more once you

00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,270
assign copyright you no longer own that

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,870
code you've given up ownership of the

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,670
code but you are granted back a license

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,920
include to do whatever you want which

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,290
includes sub-licensing and some

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,730
licensing is what allows you to then use

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,230
that code in for example of a bright

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:28,140
airy product if you want or any other

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:29,160
life serve any other license I'm kind of

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,890
moving quickly so I'm trying to make up

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,990
time so there's kind of a question here

00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:39,080
right

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:41,250
if you find code online can you use it

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,460
how many people will copy and pasted

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:48,330
code from somewhere into their product

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:52,770
pretty much everybody the answer is

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:54,120
actually no if you've done that you're

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,520
probably infringing on somebody's

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,890
copyright with some exceptions I'll talk

00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,110
about this in a second if by default if

00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,450
you publish code on your blog for

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,450
example and you do not have a statement

00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:09,090
of license on your blog nobody can use

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,740
reproduce distribute do anything with

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,210
that because you own the copyright and

00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:17,430
you've not licensed them rights to it

00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:19,830
now that is actually international

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,980
that's part of bern copyright copyright

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,700
condition so some websites have tried to

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,110
deal with this

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:31,130
this is github is default in their FAQ

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:33,660
they say if you don't choose a license

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,880
that default rights apply which means no

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,470
rights so if you're on if you're looking

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,350
at a github repository and there's no

00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,870
statement of license you cannot use it

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,610
get hubs Terms of Service allow you to

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,980
still fork that repository if you want

00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,560
to read it under your own account

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,180
I guess can't actually do anything with

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,350
it

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,020
Stack Overflow has taken a different

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,910
approach so if you copy and pasted code

00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:00,990
out of Stack Overflow you're probably

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:04,880
okay I've Noah all code posted on Stack

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:09,090
Overflow is by default creative commons

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,520
attribution/share-alike so that means

00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:14,430
that that snippet of code must be sure

00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,820
to like technically that means you ought

00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,600
to be distributing snippets of code

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,710
nobody I've ever talked to who thought

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,300
that really was real

00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,310
the attribution piece does matter though

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,950
so technically if you copy and paste

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,260
code out of stack overflow into your

00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,940
program in your notices file where you

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,590
say hey this program uses the following

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,640
open source projects you need to mention

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,640
that Stack Overflow user

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,090
so does opens words require assignment

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,130
the answer is no as the prime example

00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:46,440
the Linux kernel has more than 15,000

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,330
contributors and many of those

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,210
contributors are companies right huge

00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,770
organizations with many many developers

00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,500
within them there is no copyright

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:59,340
assignment fill in external right so the

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,560
the Linux kernel is owned by tens of

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:05,310
thousands of people right there is no

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,320
one person that owns that thing so the

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,790
reason copyright assignment happens the

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,680
reason some people some organizations

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,420
require copyright assignment the first

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,900
is for dual licensing business models

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:19,830
right so this is what happened to MySQL

00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:21,930
MySQL for example where if you want to

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,450
have a business model where there is an

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,440
open-source version of your software

00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,940
that's strong copyleft

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,890
and if somebody wants to use your

00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,690
software and a proprietary product right

00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,980
you can do a license it and say you can

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,030
have the free version if you use it you

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,070
have to provide your own source code

00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,210
your customers or you can pay us and

00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,060
then you can keep everything private

00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,590
right that's a dual license model you

00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,990
can only do that if you actually own all

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,070
the code right because it's long sit

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,200
that that function the mechanism is

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,550
copyright so for you to have owned all

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,170
the code that means everyone that

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,300
contributes must assign copyright to you

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,670
the other reason is for litigating

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,230
infringement this is actually why this

00:16:53,670 --> 00:17:00,360
was this is why I can radio requires

00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:03,570
assignment because in the United States

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,710
only the copyright owner can enforce

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:10,680
copyright infringement so that's why

00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:11,850
free software projects that are part of

00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,510
the good new umbrella typically require

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:18,780
copyright assignment because new one of

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:21,590
their goals is to litigate infringers in

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,550
order to do that they must own copyright

00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:26,450
this is actually not true in other

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:29,820
countries the biggest one being Germany

00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:31,170
which is why Harald belts GPL violations

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,360
work and the early two-thousands was so

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,460
successful because didn't matter if he

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,080
own copyright or not he could litigate

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,610
against anybody who was violating GPL

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,610
regardless what others this project

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,160
so I imagine a lot of people in here

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,380
have dealt with this before either

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:52,120
trying to produce use code or produce

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:53,260
code there's this interesting issue with

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,990
government copyright in the United

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,070
States so the goal here is anything

00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,360
produced by government employees they

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,150
don't buy the taxpayer which means it's

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:05,650
public domain so the governor employee

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:07,900
produces code it's public domain the the

00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,820
problem with that is if it's public

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,670
domain remember the mechanism for

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,050
licensing is copyright so if no

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,330
copyright is held the government

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,370
technically cannot provide its code

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,980
under a license what are the three major

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,110
causes of licensing the right to use you

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,840
have to provide notice and limitation of

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:29,340
Liability there's the government want to

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,650
release code and not limit its liability

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,090
the answer is no government does not

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,970
like doing that

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,420
so most government councils will say you

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,130
may not contribute to open source

00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,630
because we don't own it therefore you

00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,740
can't license it therefore somebody

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,830
could use it and then sue the US

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,060
government this has resulted in many

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,220
many years of nothing getting released

00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,420
there is a lot of super interesting

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,250
efforts happening now to make this

00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,040
better

00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:00,550
the Army Research Lab is for example has

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:02,850
their council is has developed a really

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:05,230
impressive vehicle for releasing code

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,020
the Defense digital service of Pentagon

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,550
as we has developed a separate vehicle

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,100
and I'm actually gonna show a really

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,970
cool recent example before I do that

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,370
though I'll just show you real quickly

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,020
this problem this problem is not true in

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,610
most other countries a great example of

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,710
all countries that are part of a

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,510
Commonwealth realm which is part of the

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,630
crown used to be part of the British

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,950
Empire and you can UK for example

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,410
government employees produced things

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:32,950
that are owned by the crown and then the

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:36,610
crown can license code so here's an

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,740
example of something recent the NSA

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,000
released Sidra which is a reverse

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,480
engineering framework and I released it

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,620
out of their patch e 2.0 license so

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,250
question immediately is okay how did

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,860
they do that right and you probably

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,900
can't read the text but what they say

00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,070
here is portions of this product or

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,360
creative ID US government and not

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,040
subject to US copyright

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,770
sections oh I should say what's

00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,030
interesting about this is code produced

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,530
by the US government is not subject

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,640
opera traditions in the United States

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,830
because the public domain in the United

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,230
States actually is subject operate

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,490
protections internationally so the US

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,850
government can protect their code

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,200
internationally but not domestically the

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,910
remaining portions are copyright their

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,920
respective authors so then they had this

00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,770
huge block here that says what the

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,510
intent of the licensing is they

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,540
basically say this is licensed under an

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:33,220
Apache 2.0 by the way it mostly doesn't

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:36,280
apply what we really want it to so this

00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,480
actually does kind of matter and most of

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,690
the time these sorts of things have gone

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,549
to court intent matters right you think

00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,690
about patent infringement right there's

00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:45,280
a difference between accidentally

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,200
infringing on a patent and intentionally

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,250
infringing on a patent intent tends to

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,549
matter so I was really excited by about

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:58,059
this by the way so Robin raised a

00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:59,049
question of patents I I thought I should

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:00,610
have added this question to the quiz

00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,070
what happens if someone gives you a

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,750
license to use something right so they

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,419
produce code it really sit over from

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:11,980
this apply some but they don't provide

00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:15,669
pathway and thus by using that code you

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:18,520
are infringing upon their patents this

00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:19,750
is a totally real situation and

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,010
realistically it's happening all the

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:26,559
time because many many many commonly

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:30,100
used licenses are written 20-25 years

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:34,660
ago before the patentability of software

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:38,110
was a thing all right before who was it

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,419
that tried to sue Susie or Novell SEO I

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,820
think claiming they own Linux kernel for

00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:45,340
example anyways this has turned into a

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,590
huge nightmare because those old

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:52,330
licenses do not provide express patent

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:54,870
grants do they actually imply it imply

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:59,380
do they provide implied patent grants

00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:01,809
nobody knows it's up to your lawyer so

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,760
new licenses provide patent grants the

00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:06,000
GPL version 3 which is what canario uses

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,040
has an express patent grant this means

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,730
that if you upstream code into

00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,500
radio for example and that in order to

00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:18,180
use that code a user would necessarily

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:22,540
infringe upon one of your patents you

00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:27,840
automatically provide a license to that

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:31,030
patent to every user of the radio now

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,340
this is pretty much exists in every new

00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:36,880
license it's written the goal of being

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,220
such that prevent users from falling

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,420
into the trap write a finding code and

00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,250
using it and then getting sued for it

00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,470
and also just making it easier for

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,980
people to release code that they want

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,810
other people to use so there's this

00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,950
thing called the Apache patent holotape

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,390
retaliation clause

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:58,510
this is spread to other licenses as well

00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:00,160
so the goal of this clause is if you

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,220
litigate against someone for patent

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:07,780
infringement that your license that code

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:12,540
terminates so let me give an example of

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:14,830
how that works let's see let's take

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:22,050
somebody somebody yelling apache license

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:27,850
software huh sure apache that's great

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:32,350
alright so let's say you own a bunch of

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:34,780
patents and this the Apaches the apache

00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,700
server happens to infringe on those

00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,870
patents when you make an open-source

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,580
when you release something on open

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,740
source code you're effectively making a

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,570
public license statement you say anyone

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,160
in the world can come use this right

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:50,850
you're providing that license to anyone

00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:53,560
under certain terms if you litigate

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,480
against someone else for patent

00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,940
infringement at ins on the apache

00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:02,470
software server your license to apache

00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,570
terminates so this is really useful and

00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:07,120
it works well for the big oh-two

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,040
software right so if you're for example

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,140
if you built your company on apache and

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,810
you planted a bunch of things that

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,640
happen to read on the apache server

00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,110
you're not going to go sue somebody from

00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,520
infringing on those patents because now

00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,410
the foundation of your company you're no

00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,760
longer allowed to use right because that

00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,870
a patent that patent retaliation Clause

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,150
kicks in and now

00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,830
in violation of every author of a path

00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,620
apache software server and you could get

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,110
sued to oblivion right realistically

00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:34,120
this doesn't always work the prime

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,280
example being Microsoft and Android so

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:40,200
Android is actually Apache License I

00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:45,280
think it has a patent retaliation closet

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:47,140
so Microsoft decided hey all of you

00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:52,120
Android this is years ago before

00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:54,070
Microsoft is kind of cool again they

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,630
said hey all of you Android handset

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,310
manufacturers you're infringed Android

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,700
and fringes on our patents we're gonna

00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:03,220
sue you well then we're like Google was

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,690
like okay Pat retaliation Claus just

00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,270
kicked in you're no longer allowed to

00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,680
use Android Microsoft is like whatever

00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,800
okay they don't care right they weren't

00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:16,570
using Android to begin with so was not

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,040
effective in scenarios like that me in

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,320
the talk quickly about licensing

00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,930
hardware so there's a number of licenses

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,150
specifically for hardware designs the

00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,770
three most popular are open hardwood a

00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:31,030
license to solder pad license the tapper

00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:36,850
open hardware license these map very

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:40,360
very clearly to hardware designs how do

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:45,850
these work for hardware ish things like

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,260
FPGAs and ASIC masks so it really

00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:51,640
depends and this is what Robin was asked

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,840
was pointing out earlier most most

00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,570
lawyers think it doesn't matter all that

00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,790
well it makes them uncomfortable there's

00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,050
sort of accepted ways of trying of doing

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,660
this if you're going to do it there's a

00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,880
GPL exception you can add to GPL license

00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,220
code that makes it possible to use with

00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,020
these kinds of things open cores or

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,100
Libre cores for example the website that

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,760
has hosts a whole bunch of open source

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:15,130
fpga card of course they use the LGPL

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,140
depending on your internal counsel a lot

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,200
of them will say that doesn't work like

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,430
you're clearly expressing your intent

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,140
for how this should be used and the fact

00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:28,480
that it's open source but it ever got

00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:34,170
taken to court this is ambiguous so this

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,170
one is kind of this is undecided so

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,960
yeah that was true like I said there's

00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:43,870
not it has never been the boundaries of

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,170
it I've never been upheld in US Court at

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,370
all

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:51,100
yep so is there's still a lot of and to

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,630
make things worse I've never spoken with

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,210
a lawyer who did not think that the GPO

00:26:52,630 --> 00:27:00,550
was written was not written and the most

00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:03,490
confusing way possible so yeah it's a

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:06,550
complicated situation but this is why

00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:09,309
Sur is leading a new hardware licensing

00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:10,450
effort there's a UK Pat IP attorney

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:12,880
involved with this it's called the open

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:15,010
hardware license fee - OHL B - it's

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,320
currently in draft mode it provides

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,030
three versions a strong copy left we

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,710
copy left and permissive versions the

00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:24,130
clauses are written specifically to

00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:28,660
apply to things like ASIC masks FPGA HDL

00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:31,330
these schematics to your hardware so sir

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,580
i I've been involved with this effort

00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,690
for the last couple of years if you're

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,150
if this is the kind of thing that you're

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:40,450
interested in you can use this link you

00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:42,490
can just google cirno hlv to give us

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,429
feedback the goal is to have this

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,440
certified within the next year or so

00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:49,929
and have people start using it and so

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,920
hopefully we have a way to produce FPGA

00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:55,450
code and ASIC masks within STRs with an

00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:59,350
open-source licensing mechanism that

00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:02,320
everyone agrees on it works and with

00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:04,570
that we are 15 minutes overdue for lunch

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,970
it actually is lunchtime now right yes

00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,900
okay so I'm not gonna take questions in

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,600
the bucket later if you want

00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,280
oh we have announcements so the first

00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,860
one is placing up and paying up your

00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,679
posters if you have a poster here the

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,840
poster session is open in the lunches

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,200
and PM breaks for next couple days what

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,200
am I the ones

00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:27,200
