Description: 
	Open Source Licensing by Ben Hilburn

Learn the basics of open-source licensing and how it works! This is not a presentation that discusses what open-source is or it’s benefits, but rather some of the stickier and more complex details of licensing that sometimes arise when using and publishing open-source projects (like GNU Radio!). Have you ever wondered if there is a license requirement for GNU Radio Out-of-Tree Modules you’ve published? Or how the GPL works with FPGA code? At the end of this presentation, you should be able to answer questions like these without Fear, Uncertainty, or Doubt!
