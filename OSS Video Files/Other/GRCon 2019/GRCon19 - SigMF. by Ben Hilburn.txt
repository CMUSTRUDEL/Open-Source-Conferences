	SigMF. by Ben Hilburn

The Signal Metadata Format (SigMF) was first announced at GRCon17, and in the last two years has grown substantially in usage, scope, and support, and is now one of GNU Radio’s most widely used efforts outside of the GNU Radio community. This presentation will provide a quick introduction to SigMF for those that aren’t familiar, give an update on the effort, and discuss the plan for the project moving forward.
