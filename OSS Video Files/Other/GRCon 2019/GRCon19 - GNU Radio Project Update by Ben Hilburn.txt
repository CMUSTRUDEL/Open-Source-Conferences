	00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,950
so this is my annual open radio project

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:24,210
update nominally kind of our state of

00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:26,220
the union so anyone who's seen this

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,759
before at least for the last three years

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,800
is used to me yelling it all of you for

00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:36,739
waiting until the very last minute to

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:42,270
book your tickets so I made this chart

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:44,640
about maybe two weeks ago and you can

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,719
see it was just below 300 then I was

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,749
looking at this I was like this isn't so

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,190
bad I mean it it isn't it's not like the

00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:53,399
flat thing and then the exponential

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,780
spike right that would usually see well

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,320
I'm worried about the solvency of the

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,559
conference and that kind of thing but in

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,070
the last like week that has spiked to

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,320
way up above 350 I just didn't have time

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:12,060
to make a new chart because all of you

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,920
registered so late so I might just give

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,470
up at this point and accept that

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,150
like we somehow have to forward pay for

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,450
GR con before getting money from any of

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,520
you but thank you all for being here so

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,590
I'm going to kick this right off with

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:33,210
the big news three point eight is

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:37,200
finally out so yeah so huge thanks to

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,259
the core development community Marcus

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,869
Muller and Andre and Martin and everyone

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,979
that serves in an Officer position of

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,270
the project worked extremely hard over

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,159
the last year to make this happen you

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,219
might have noticed that the 3.8 release

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,770
announcement came out extremely early in

00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,670
the morning German time I realized

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,950
there's more than one timezone in

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:04,369
Germany I apologize but yeah this was a

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,119
lot of work so there were more than 200

00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:11,400
contributors in the changelog 43.8 and

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,850
we went in thought okay what does that

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,550
mean

00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,010
how many projects not just have 200

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:20,240
contributors but have 200 active

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:25,080
contributors and there's not many

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:27,250
there's not many we do radio is very

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,580
legitimately up at the top

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,340
in terms of community engagement and

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,570
participation and the type of people and

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,440
the breadth of people that are

00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,580
participating it is also good that we

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,640
did this

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:45,090
since Python 2.7 is no longer supported

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,030
in less than three months now I think

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,430
and our 3.8 release was the Python 3

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,980
migration so we kind of got by by the

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,000
skin of our teeth there so one of the

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,360
things I was interesting about releasing

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,220
3.8 is the news got picked up in a lot

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,810
of places that we'd never heard of

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,310
before here's a few examples this

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,040
website packet had all the thing on it

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,090
now lwn net I'm sure everybody's

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,540
familiar with but they had a big piece

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,070
on it we hit the front page of hacker

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,230
news I don't really care for that

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,850
website at all but it was interesting to

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,530
see a good radio release announcement

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,790
being on the front page of hacker news

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,480
with a whole bunch of people commenting

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,790
on it we made several print magazines so

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,320
this is a picture from Derrick of the

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,180
resis idea of Great Britain's magazine

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,890
where they sort of copy and pasted

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,799
chunks of the changelog in ways that

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:38,350
don't make any sense into the magazine

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,030
that they did in a way that it's like

00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,350
not all that great it made like it's the

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,600
first sentences like it's their first

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,860
release in six years and the next

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,860
sentence there's a bunch of code stuff

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:55,060
but we got a lot of attention for this

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:57,190
it was really cool one of the things

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,100
that we've gotten the most comments on

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:08,380
is that yes it finally has squiggly

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:12,030
lines James are you in the audience now

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:16,180
of course the examples just worked James

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:19,690
did you expect something different so

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,070
one major note here is the you're out of

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,590
three modules probably have to be ported

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,380
so if you are an out of tree maintainer

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,940
please get your stuff ported Bastion

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,770
blah so actually wrote an excellent

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,600
guide for how to do this that works

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,979
really well it's not a huge challenge

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,530
most of the problems are really the

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:38,200
Python 2/7 Python 3 assuming your blocks

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:41,639
are written in Python but the porting

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:45,300
guide is pretty pretty straightforward

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:50,020
so isn't my yearly stats slide

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,699
participation is way way up you can see

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,910
the numbers for clas issues and pull

00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:57,789
requests and this is kind of this isn't

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,320
a full view right because a lot of the

00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:00,729
community doesn't act a lot of the

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,160
community does not interact it's gonna

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:05,430
radio through github and so most of

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,300
these numbers are through github but

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,380
enough of the community interacts with

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,910
it that kind of gives you some idea of

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:14,770
the overall growth right so you can see

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,259
we're at 1,100 here when I pulled this

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,440
chart 1,100 unique cloners per two-week

00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:22,949
period just from github alone that's up

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:27,940
by several hundred from last year are

00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:29,860
executed clas are up 155 percent were up

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,289
almost sixty percent in year over year

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,699
closed issues and pull requests went

00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:40,960
from 217 to 443 so participation is

00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:43,150
accelerating we once again participated

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,300
in some of code programs so we actually

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,039
did not participate in the SAS Summer of

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,250
Code program this year but Daniel

00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,539
Estevez did and had a student work with

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,919
can radio and actually he has a poster

00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,010
here and Daniel has a has a keynote

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,409
later this week our two Summer of Code

00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:03,039
projects were a block header parsing

00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:04,870
tool which will Auto parse your your

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,190
blocks source code header and produce a

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:12,360
gr CMO file and then found who who

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:15,340
should be here are you in the audience

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,320
hey I'm so glad you made it

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,050
Fallon had a very long way to travel to

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,240
get here he created a cycle accurate

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,070
simulation of air log files from GRC so

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,650
if you have a fare log file you can drop

00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,360
it in using his code and actually get

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,759
verilock simulation from within your

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,449
flow graph they both have posters in the

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,610
expo balance here to present his and if

00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,009
you have questions about up its work you

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,080
can talk to Nicholas and I want to give

00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:44,610
a really big thanks to Felix for once

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,139
again running G sock it is a lot of work

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,880
in terms of managing the overall program

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,340
working with Google managing the

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,320
movement of funds it's a it's it's not

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,320
an insignificant task so thank you very

00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,180
much Felix

00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,530
so technically we ran this last year the

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,770
reason I'm going to talk about it now is

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:05,139
we want to do another one shortly so

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,639
last year we released several sigmaf

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:09,699
recordings containing some hidden

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,820
messages and just kind of threw them out

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,840
in the community and wanted to see how

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,250
much interest there was and turns out

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,500
there's a lot of interest

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,300
we got participation from all over the

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,919
world our winners were from the US

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,110
France Hungary Slovakia and the

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,389
Netherlands the challenges themselves

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,360
were built with RDS and some simulated

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:30,430
Noah down links but this was really

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,350
exciting and people got really really

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:37,590
into it so we are planning to do another

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:41,590
one of these and the goal is to have it

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,940
have a breadth of challenge levels so

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,070
ones that are you know doable and

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,680
solvable by people who are perhaps new

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,910
and some that are really difficult so

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,289
keep an eye out for this we should have

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,080
an announcement somewhat Sirian about

00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:57,550
this one of the things we did this year

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,740
was the SETI Institute sponsored and

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,700
hosted a hackathon at the Allen

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,560
telescope array and Hat Creek California

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,200
this was prompt we've had a lot of

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,479
hackathons over the years this is

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,039
probably one of my favorites so we had

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,260
30 attendees there over 30 attendees

00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:18,160
from industry government academia and

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:20,950
hobbyists and it it attracted a lot of

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,650
people who otherwise had not

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,210
participated in the community so the key

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,880
areas of development there were sick of

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,190
eff gonna radio blocks for actually

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,010
working with an on the Allen telescope

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:36,039
array which microscope I did Mike's here

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,950
and he is running the SDR for space

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,630
signals workshop tomorrow a good idea

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,209
for radio astronomy and I'll talk about

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,740
that more in just a second antenna array

00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:46,750
monitoring and health from Guinea radio

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,150
and machine learning for signal

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,110
detection and classification so one of

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,020
the really cool things that came out of

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:55,150
this there was a lot but one of them I

00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,459
want to highlight now Nick Foster

00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,020
produced flow graphs for actually

00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:00,700
processing signals from Voyager

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,130
so the SETI Institute has been

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,839
publishing siga MEF recordings from the

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,700
Allen telescope array and Green Bank and

00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,080
so you can go download those and then

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,149
use Nick Foster

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,720
to play with wager signals from green

00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:15,519
radio and these lines will go live so if

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,080
you don't want to like try to type those

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,000
new URLs real quickly you can click the

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,589
click the links and I had to include

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,890
this picture because it really was

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:28,390
beautiful there it it was phenomenal so

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,740
I'm gonna go through just a couple other

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,910
things that generally happened that

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:37,920
people might not be aware of so there is

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:40,600
a conference hosted by n solely owned in

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,430
the EU every year called EU can radio

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,980
days this was its second year and it

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:47,140
more than doubled in size so this is

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:51,910
pretty quickly becoming sort of the an

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:54,160
EU EU version of GR con this year it was

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,170
in I no chance I'm going to pronounce

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,079
that correctly as I'm calling France

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:02,649
they have already announced for next

00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:07,329
year in again I'm not gonna pounce this

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:09,490
boy tears somebody help me France so it

00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:11,140
is always in June this year

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,940
Marcus Mueller keynoted we had a bunch

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,940
of the people fly in from the ganor ADR

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,230
leadership it's you might notice you

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,660
might recognize some of the sponsor

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,029
names here especially analog devices and

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,470
wrote in shorts they have really really

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:25,300
interesting content and they have a lot

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,529
of participation from the EU academic

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,779
community

00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:32,529
so I recommend making the trip if you

00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:35,649
can do it there's also the SDR Academy

00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:38,950
so this was its fifth year it's

00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:40,209
organized by one professor in from

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,459
Germany and one professor from the UK

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,560
and you can see one of their write their

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:46,240
top their top requested topics are

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,670
advances in radio related research and

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,410
projects so this is another it's a

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,760
one-day event so it can be if you're

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,190
based in the US it can be hard to make

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,510
the trip out for one-day event but if

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,020
you're looking for an excuse to go to

00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,850
Germany this this particular event is

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,949
specifically geared to be like a

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,300
learning experience right it's called an

00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:06,839
academy specifically because it's

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,060
supposed to be an educational experience

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,130
so this kind of leads me to what I'm

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,620
going to spend most of my time here

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,170
talking about which is the gain radio

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,459
community itself it so every year you

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,649
know I kind of spent like 10 minutes of

00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:21,550
this talk sort of highlighting major

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,680
things that

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,519
and around the green radio community

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,880
that some of you may or may not have

00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,870
heard about one of the things I'm you

00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,300
know really want to try to get across

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:36,490
this year is just the incredible breadth

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,370
of everything that's happening in and

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:46,300
around gonna radio all the time all the

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:48,850
time and so I use the word community a

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,579
lot it's kind of ambiguous right is

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,339
community the developer community is it

00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:57,010
the people who come to GR con is it the

00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,860
community on the mailing list right

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:03,700
in reality the community that most of us

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,779
know is a tiny microcosm of everything

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,010
that's happening you can read your best

00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:08,529
guess is the mailing list is somewhere

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:13,959
less than five percent of users GL con

00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:17,500
is way less than 1% there are things

00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:23,410
happening constantly so what I've done

00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:25,839
is I have gone back over the year and

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,829
tried to pull a lot of really neat

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:35,230
things I saw on Twitter just on Twitter

00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:37,870
about things that are happening so just

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:41,200
one example there are classes that are

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,790
taught all the time and events happening

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,339
all the time that people from gray do

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,410
attend or even teach so on the left is

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,420
an image from a generated tutorial

00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,430
workshop taught by Derek in Belgium on

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,110
the right there is a picture of the Kaos

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,329
communications camp in Germany which was

00:12:53,110 --> 00:13:01,870
just a couple weeks ago a good radio was

00:12:55,329 --> 00:13:03,399
hosted by stratum zero this is so NSF is

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,779
running a program called power are

00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,430
they're building city scale test beds

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,290
like literally it's a their

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,630
collaborations between universities in

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,820
the city and the university goes out and

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,130
deploys SDR test beds over the city like

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,180
putting them on buildings and making a

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,360
test bed that people can use for

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,010
scientific research powder is one of

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,140
them it's in Salt Lake City so it's the

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,149
cooperation between Salt Lake and

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,070
University of Utah using Harvard from

00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:29,320
Rice University they built the powder

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,360
test bed they're running gonna radio

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,260
tutorials in Salt Lake City pretty

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,260
constantly actually

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:41,690
these are really cool tweets from case

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:44,930
basa so case works at the Institute for

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:48,200
astronomy in the Netherlands and he

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,600
volunteers at the week doing Lu 3 glue

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,510
big movers thank you thank you Paul

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,779
what's that Paul yeah thanks I did

00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:59,329
really well telescope so Paul is

00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:04,010
actually major part of that is giving a

00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:05,630
talk on Thursday about this work but and

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,730
Daniel Estevez is also a major part of

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,700
this but I'm gonna highlight these

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,380
tweets from from case just because

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,820
they're so cool so you might have heard

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:19,760
that of the dsl w the dsl w PB which was

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,990
the lunar orbiter that nasa flew into

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,190
the syrup crashing of the surface of the

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,570
moon right he observed that from the

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,850
telescope and you can see here on the

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,820
left the comitia flow graph running and

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,260
sort of live-tweeted this happening as

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,149
he was that as he was making these

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,540
observations off the telescope and then

00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:40,670
as the orbiter crash into the moon and

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,860
you can see on the right where he

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,680
determined that it had in fact crashed

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:48,649
and there was a crater on the moon this

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,459
happened again just a few weeks ago with

00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:55,100
the indian vikram lander where he was

00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:56,329
live tweeting and tracking the vikram

00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,610
lander as it attempted to land on the

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:01,130
moon unfortunately crashed you can see

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,890
on the right here where things kind of

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,620
go awry and he I think he was actually

00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,779
looked elsewhere for someone to have

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,690
determined that the vikram lander had

00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:15,410
crashed before this and I couldn't find

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,690
it I think this was the first lord of

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:22,640
like public evidence that the vikram

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:25,779
lander had failed to land so I found

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,970
this one this is a this was a Chinese

00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:30,320
satellite it took off and I have no idea

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:35,959
by the way I have no idea and most

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:40,610
people need and these tweets are found

00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:42,380
this one he D modulae basically was

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,029
engineered and de modulated the

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,620
satellite downlink using Carrillo flow

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:47,610
graphs and posted all the flow graphs

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,420
and the data recorded from them

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,880
just for fun settlers continues to be

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,600
amazing so we had second ox keynote last

00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,160
year which was awesome and now they have

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,730
all kinds of neat stuff happening in the

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,710
community like people building these

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:07,290
touchscreen stations to run their set

00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:10,830
Knox ground stations which of course you

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:14,130
know using a radio behind the hood this

00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:18,900
is one of my favorites this is Andrew

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:21,540
who wrote GQ rx who toured the ESA is

00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:26,280
keeps that ground station during the Q

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:28,140
set workshop and the ESA asked perhaps

00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,750
some of you know this software which was

00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,830
the software that Alexander had wrote so

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,470
we got a picture of him sitting next to

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,140
the ground station running G predict and

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,790
G qrx

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:41,370
so a faceful ground continues to move

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,980
quickly you might have if you were here

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,940
last year we've seen a presentation from

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,380
Michelle Thompson about that who's one

00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,470
of the GL con organizers and she ran the

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:52,590
the block party last year for building

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,390
block decoders and there's a lot of work

00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,130
happening around here for satellite

00:16:54,390 --> 00:17:01,680
downlink decoding especially from Ron

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:06,030
Economist who his his working name is

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,580
dr. MPEG so all of the dVB's stuff DVB

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:12,450
anything that exists in the open source

00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:17,310
world has probably come from wrong so

00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:20,340
dvb-t T 2 s 2 s 2 X he's written all

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,650
those decoders and he continues to push

00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,070
that forward as part of the face for

00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,440
effort

00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:27,690
now what's really cool about this kind

00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,280
of thing is like once you're sort of

00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,860
tuned into this you start seeing it pop

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,890
up everywhere so as an example I saw

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,320
this wired headline about this is def

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:40,500
def con talk this year watching a drone

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,130
takeover a smart TV NDA here is Smart

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,460
TVs

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,990
well the hack that was being shown was

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,310
that Smart TVs have absolutely no

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,190
authentication and do not care at all

00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:52,320
where signals come from and so he stuck

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,720
a Raspberry Pi on a drone and fluid over

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,400
somebody's house and the smart prompt on

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,720
the Smart TV came up and said please

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,890
give me your Wi-Fi password and you need

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,840
to reconnect to the network and it

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:04,409
looked totally legitimate

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,389
and as I'm watching YouTube video be

00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:10,049
kind of pans right to the laptop and you

00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:12,509
can see him running the DVB ron's BBB

00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:15,870
utils for this work so the stuff is

00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:17,220
everywhere and there's there's clear

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,460
very clearly a space-themed to these by

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,409
the way just because we're here there's

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,090
a lot more that's not space themed so

00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:26,309
these are interesting so that on the

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,159
left is somebody who's tweeting about

00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:31,710
having built their CubeSat ground

00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,499
station with a hack RF this does not

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,389
just received this transmit and receive

00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:38,549
on the right so I actually edited this

00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:41,340
slide this morning to add the one on the

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:46,110
right this tweet went out last night

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:48,090
about this person took gr like sat and

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,990
modified it and are now decoding

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:54,840
tourists want telemetry which i think is

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:57,360
a Chinese satellite that's now somehow

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,590
part of AMSAT in some way I don't I

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,340
don't actually know what Taurus one is I

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,559
tried to look it up and got confused so

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,139
there's now a Libra space has produced

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,769
ASAP comm channel simulator which was

00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:13,649
really cool so this was a joint joint

00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:17,249
initiative from ESA and Lieber space

00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:20,399
that came out of Baker space and you

00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:23,369
could fully simulate SATCOM channels so

00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:25,950
I'm gonna read it out I thought these

00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:27,779
were really really neat so on the left

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:32,039
actually for I'm not really sure what

00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:34,499
that thing on the left is it's clearly

00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,940
some tiny little arm-based board I'm

00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:38,700
assuming

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:43,710
but they got GTR running on it with an

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:45,720
RTO on the right is a Nintendo switch so

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,730
this was kind of cool this is actually

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,879
it's an RTL dongle that's running

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:54,059
somewhere else and streaming samples to

00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:57,840
the switch over Wi-Fi and then they have

00:19:54,059 --> 00:20:00,299
G key rx running on the switch just

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,590
really I I have no idea who this person

00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:05,149
a specter of a guess are you in the

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,000
audience

00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:10,169
No so whoever they are they tweet really

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,990
cool stuff pretty regularly with new

00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:14,520
radio haven't a clue where they are who

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,440
they are but

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,420
is really neat he said that the next

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,380
thing you want to do was the other thing

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,270
that you started working on was trying

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:27,870
to get phosphor running on the switch

00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:30,000
accelerated by the graphics card this is

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,730
some cybersecurity stuff all right on

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,870
the left is Holly graceful basically

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:38,640
doing some playback attacks for fun on

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,130
the right so there's actually pretty

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,250
regularly I wanted a little bit more

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:46,380
later there's pretty regularly courses

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:50,400
given and tutorials written about using

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,100
radio for cybersecurity we almost never

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,500
hear from the people doing this which is

00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,810
which is interesting but that has

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,960
especially exploded in the last two

00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:03,870
years this was with the success of the

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,060
hack RF from Great Scott gadgets and the

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:09,180
explosion of the RTL dongle

00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,710
it's made our s way more accessible to

00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,750
the cybersecurity community which

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,830
perhaps didn't previously have the radio

00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,360
background who've been successful with

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,990
it and I have some more slides about

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,070
that in a minute

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,970
one thing I do want to kind of highlight

00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:24,090
here so gr Jo sim hit the news again

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:28,620
survey is familiar gr GSM it's been

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:31,500
around since about 2014 and on the left

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:38,310
so there was a an article written by

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:41,070
vice where the Vice journalists made an

00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:42,600
MC catcher with gr GSM in 30 minutes and

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,550
wrote an article about it and so that

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,250
then of course exploded and it got

00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:50,460
captured on the right by Cory Doctorow

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:53,010
his blog blowing blowing and that spread

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:57,150
really quickly it's kinda interesting

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:59,010
because I think actually we haven't we

00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,260
haven't really worked with G arson gr

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,450
GSM in a little while it's kind of an

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,210
indicator of how the radio community

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,850
tends to tends to push things forward

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,710
really quickly often before sort of

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,360
everyone else that might be interested

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,500
in it realizes what's happening and then

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,470
we see this effect where like five years

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,210
later people like oh my gosh like this

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,400
happened and it hits the news and

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,190
spreads everywhere this was kind of like

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,620
right two years ago when the Daily Mail

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:28,050
published an article about stealing cars

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:30,200
with hack RF all right we see this

00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,200
pretty

00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,820
again cybersecurity courses there's new

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,370
radio based cybersecurity courses that

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,049
get taught at tons of cyber said tons of

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,309
conferences I just grabbed these as

00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:43,410
quick examples this one's for b-sides

00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:45,090
and one on the right some blackhat the

00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,740
one on the bottom is actually an online

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:50,039
course that was written by Bastion

00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,990
there's actually several textbook series

00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:55,169
now they've been released that teach

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,419
cybersecurity with uni radio the person

00:22:55,169 --> 00:23:00,570
who wrote those in the audience well I

00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:03,330
don't know who they are I really liked

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,860
this one so this is Dominic's tonic

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,610
spills ridiculous radios they got a

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,070
feature on hackaday

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:10,080
so he builds SD ours out of random parts

00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,710
the one on the right is built out of

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,360
parts from a VCR that interfaces and you

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,590
can see it that's probably I don't know

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,419
if it's what too washed out you can see

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:23,159
the radial flow graphs running in that

00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:25,919
image there so we also continue to see

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,620
an expansion in education than

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,539
curriculum development so this one this

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,940
happens again this kind of thing happens

00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:36,620
all the time and I feel like I only we

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,970
only see like bits and pieces of it so

00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:43,200
Dan could Jacob I'm not actually sure

00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:44,909
how Dan spotted this Stuttgart tweeted

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,520
that they were phasing in a radio into

00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:48,809
some other courses and Dan caught it and

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,030
so I reached out to professor

00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:55,610
and turns out they're making green radio

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:58,020
the core of their signal processing

00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,970
radio wireless communications curriculum

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,950
at the undergrad and graduate levels and

00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:05,039
rolling out an entire curriculum for it

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,020
starting next year and this kind of

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,059
thing happens all the time it's just

00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,620
that you know the professor who the

00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,730
professors who have done this are not

00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,190
here

00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:17,480
we don't necessarily hear from them so

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:20,669
what I'm really trying to communicate is

00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,570
this community to again sort of overuse

00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:26,909
the term is huge and there's there's

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,010
just constant motion and constant

00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:30,870
development and I think we only really

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,700
see a very small part of that and I

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,740
think it speaks to the strength of what

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,170
we built so

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,960
quickly go through some expansions and

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:42,370
growth and hardware support so symbol

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,140
hound announced ago radio blocks last

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:50,440
year which was really cool

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:53,290
rtl-sdr is made basically chained forts

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,080
for RTL dongles together and called it

00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,850
the Kerberos SDR and has made that it's

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,470
specifically geared for

00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,350
direction-finding

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:04,720
Adi is working through the grep process

00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,400
to upstream GRI IO ending an array o

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,040
which uses the linux kernel's Industrial

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,510
IO module for data movement if you want

00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,550
to get involved in this graph because

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,620
you care about data movement on embedded

00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:18,270
devices go do it

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,270
we're really really excited about this

00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:24,940
there's kiwi SDR which is a low cost low

00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:28,660
cost STRs built specifically for

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,309
geolocation deep waves gr wave learner

00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,190
which is built specifically to

00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:35,820
facilitate performing inference machine

00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,870
learning with a new area flow graphs

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,040
this is one I just thought this morning

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,320
actually

00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,200
Hermes light 2 which is have been

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,760
designed to be a low cost HF design it

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,580
actually uses the eighty ninety eight

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:52,240
sixty six which is a cable modem from

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,590
Adi as the codec but it's that that

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,760
particular part is produced in such

00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:58,660
quantities that this is going to be

00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:01,240
extremely cheap so I'm gonna I'm

00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,710
highlighting this one the two juh - huh

00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,400
I'm actually sure how they pronounced at

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:09,490
SDR because albums teego is one of the

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,100
developers at this board so this is an

00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:14,380
FPGA based SDR that's being built to be

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,730
a Raspberry Pi accessory board

00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,070
I'm gonna talk about Volk in a second

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,200
but there's been tremendous movement in

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:23,980
vogue recently and a lot of that is

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,650
happening because of this SDR so with

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,790
that let's talk about Vulcan Sikkim F

00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:30,040
for anyone who's not familiar involve

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:34,059
olk is the vector authorized vector

00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:36,130
optimized library of kernels it is our

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,410
way of doing Cindy single structure

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,809
multiple data operations to accelerate

00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:42,700
flow graphs and then Singham F is and

00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,919
I've talked on this later but sigmaf is

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,429
a way to create data recordings and then

00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,100
share them and process them so Volk has

00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:51,350
seen

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:54,280
a lot of development in the last six

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:57,470
months especially on armed devices and

00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,240
especially on the Raspberry Pi so if you

00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,590
have not tried running good radio on the

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,030
Raspberry Pi recently and that's

00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,230
something you care about you should give

00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:06,950
it a shot

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:08,270
Albin has been on a roll and has been

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,710
committing kernels and making

00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,970
improvements on almost weekly basis

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,140
we're very lucky to have all been

00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,180
participating he's actually an

00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:21,140
anesthesiologist in Sweden

00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:23,840
that just does this for fun and the guy

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,070
is pumping out sim D optimized kernels

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,110
at a rate that's incredibly I don't know

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:34,540
how it's not his full-time job it's

00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:38,150
amazing so sig MF has also expanded

00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,350
significantly in the last year one of

00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:42,500
the interesting things that we've seen

00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:46,310
about Sigma s expansion is that it's

00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:49,580
mostly silent most of the people that

00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:51,500
are using stickum F don't actually like

00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,940
tell us that they're doing it I sort of

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,860
just pick up these bits and pieces of

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,150
things or like somebody will send me

00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:00,620
like a statement of work piece from like

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,570
a company or a government or something

00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,670
like that and it is demanding that

00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,020
everything be delivered in Sikkim F so

00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:09,950
sick of F is sort of like silently

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:12,980
taking over the sharing of RF data so we

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,360
spent a full week at the SETI SETI

00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,430
hackfest working on the Sigma design a

00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,690
core group of us did I'm gonna talk a

00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,970
lot more about taking off my talk on

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,710
Wednesday but not everyone is gonna be

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,570
there because I my talk is after lunch

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,400
so there's gonna be the workshop split

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,200
so the one thing I want to make clear to

00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,560
everybody if you're not gonna make it

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,560
being the talk is that it's become clear

00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,510
that the current design of CAF is really

00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,450
good at what it does but that it can do

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:40,880
a lot more if we make some non backwards

00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,350
compatible changes and the direction

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,990
we're going to take it specifically is

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:48,380
to try to answer the question how can

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:50,810
you record data and describe it and it's

00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,190
such such that another program another

00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,530
computer can understand those

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:58,520
descriptions without a human ever being

00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:59,960
involved and we made really good

00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,840
progress on this but it's going to break

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,679
backwards compatibility so going

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,320
we're going to take the existing

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,360
cigarette structure clean it up close

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,700
the remaining issues basically put that

00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,800
into maintenance mode bug fixes only and

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,570
from there the new development branch

00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,460
will break backwards-compatibility

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,929
but this is the direction we're going

00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:23,630
and we have good momentum to get there

00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:26,300
so I couldn't talk about sigmaf and not

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,890
talk about knowing that I was going to

00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,340
build this presentation with mostly

00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,410
tweets I tweeted last week and said you

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,630
know if there's any if you have a

00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:38,570
favorite video tweet Symphony now

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:43,070
I might include it the one that I got

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:46,210
back a lot was actually mine but not

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:49,280
perhaps in the way you might think so I

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,950
thought I was being clever

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:57,140
we just got my deep sake we just moved

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:59,540
to a very high rise in Arlington that

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,540
overlooks DC so I thought I was being

00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,550
all clever and taking pictures of might

00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,590
be 200 you know connected to this

00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,270
antenna overlooking DC probably can't

00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,490
see it that's the Washington Monument

00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,929
this is Georgetown right these are

00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,270
pictures on the right this is a picture

00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:17,270
of Arlington so you know the antenna

00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:19,220
pointed back over like Rosslyn and

00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:24,860
Ballston and courthouse in those areas

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:27,170
now this is so cool right and then I got

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:32,470
dunked on harder than I've ever been

00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:35,660
dunked on in my life when UC berkeley

00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:40,670
tweeted their collaboration of tellus

00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:45,610
radio telescopes and then to make it

00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:45,610
worse this was in videos response

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:56,730
thank you Nvidia so on that note I'm

00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,290
gonna talk a little bit about SETI we're

00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,420
really excited to announce that SETI is

00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:05,580
co-sponsoring to the SETI Institute is

00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:06,600
co-sponsoring gol con 20 so you might

00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,180
remember SETI the SETI Institute

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,650
delivered a keynote last year our

00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:14,160
collaboration with them has grown

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:17,059
substantially and in last year there's a

00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,140
lot of overlap in our joint goals and

00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:20,640
the things that we value and the things

00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,750
that we want to achieve both in terms of

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,740
technology direction and education and

00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,740
we're really excited about the way this

00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,660
is developing so just to answer a few

00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,080
questions about wait I thought said he

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:36,300
was just aliens City has is actually a

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,480
much larger program well most people are

00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,280
familiar with is set ERF that's the

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,670
thing on the right right which is

00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,170
detecting aliens with the giant array

00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,150
that you know we had the hackathon at

00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:50,820
that you that the movie cosmos was about

00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:55,410
right now cosmos sorry contact contact

00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:57,840
infusing my Carl Sagan writings they

00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:59,820
have a lot of stuff in many many

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,460
different areas it's a it's a pretty

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,490
significant research institution they're

00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,500
partners on a bunch of NASA missions

00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:12,120
they have a significant sort of

00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:14,550
worldwide network of telescopes that we

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,410
can get access to now all of the

00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,480
telescopes that the Allen telescope

00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:21,330
array is the only array that is allowed

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,820
to track human-made objects all the

00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:28,020
other rays can be used to track anything

00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:30,660
else and they have a really interesting

00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,650
mix of funding sources and partners some

00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:36,210
of whom you might recognize from the

00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:37,559
gradient community others are new so

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,470
we're really excited about the direction

00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:42,000
this is going and are looking forward to

00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,050
working with them on G or con 20 and

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,309
Steve

00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:50,370
steve Kroft you here Steve no no sorry

00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:51,600
cropped not conklin sorry dr. Steve drop

00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,900
will be here he's actually getting a

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,460
talk tomorrow Wednesday

00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,650
okay so I'll talk about that a little

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,210
bit about G or con

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:04,170
first I wanna get a huge thanks to the

00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:06,120
Geo con 19 team especially Michelle and

00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,840
Steve and Derek so if he's get a round

00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,840
of applause for them

00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:21,350
so it's it is hard to communicate how

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,920
much effort it takes to make this thing

00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,210
work

00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,500
even with all the stuff that's gone

00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,620
wrong like you don't have power strips

00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,510
right and registration took too long

00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,190
it's taken thousands of hours I'm not

00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,690
exaggerating thousands of hours to make

00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,690
this happen and we do it every year and

00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:38,059
this is all volunteer time right so

00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,860
Michelle and Steven Derek have Michelle

00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:41,870
and Steve or Co charity and Derek has

00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,179
poured tons of time into this have

00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,290
really made this possible and there's a

00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:48,050
lot of other people that contributed

00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:51,770
neopentane about its research Sam of

00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:54,740
mitre tathagata who's a professor at UAH

00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:56,000
is a lot of students here he was

00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,550
involved early with the idea of coming

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,190
to Huntsville there's a lot that goes

00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,750
into making this thing work and none of

00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,740
these people are paid to do it and they

00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:10,909
spend the entire year working on it so

00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:14,149
gr con 2020 we are almost definitely

00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:15,710
headed to Charlotte North Carolina I say

00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:17,899
almost definitely because we have not

00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:21,440
actually executed the venue contract

00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:23,570
that we have but we're probably going to

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,340
Charlotte and until we have been you

00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,440
can't guarantee dates but for the last

00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,389
like five years we've been this week of

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,190
September so probably this week of

00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:34,220
September if you're interested in

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:36,109
getting involved please reach out you

00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,600
don't have to spend thousands of hours

00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:40,700
right every little bit helps

00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,770
so if you think you just have a couple

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,990
hours every other week right even that

00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:46,129
helps so if you'd like to get involved

00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:49,550
please just shoot us an email

00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:52,220
gee our chronic great org so what I want

00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:57,770
to use the remainder of my time to talk

00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:59,480
about is project direction so each year

00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:03,080
kind of had a theme right or like a

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:07,490
question posed in 2017 the question I

00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:10,910
asked was how we hit p1 DB right it was

00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:15,020
very Oh was at that point what 16 years

00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:16,970
old had expanded significantly and the

00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,400
question was okay what what do i do from

00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:22,119
here I have we hit p1 DB and this growth

00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,940
going to start to sort of level off or

00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:28,130
in my belief was if we

00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:31,550
double down on this this is going to

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:33,320
explode into something even bigger so I

00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,330
think the very definitively the answer

00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,980
was nope we didn't we definitely did not

00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:43,580
hit p1 DB if anything things have

00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:45,650
accelerated and now we see our

00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:47,120
understanding of gonna radio has evolved

00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,180
right we used to think of it as gritty

00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,620
Oh is the project like it includes like

00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,240
volcán sigmap but everything that we all

00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,740
think of us can radio right but it's

00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,000
really so much more than that it's an

00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,290
it's an umbrella of lots of different

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,220
work it's a collaboration of

00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:03,670
universities and Industry and business

00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:08,180
most of whom we never hear from right

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:11,960
it's much broader that I think we're

00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:15,890
coming to understand just how strong and

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,240
how large the footprint is so in 2018 I

00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:22,220
asked how do we dress sustainability so

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,800
since last year a lot of really good

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:28,090
things have happened here the thing that

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,010
I was most worried about last year was

00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:33,220
effectively financial support for people

00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:36,230
to work full-time on Caray do

00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,390
we've had several good conversations

00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:42,020
came out of this and things are actually

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:43,520
looking really good we have sponsors

00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,640
that have stepped forward to help fund

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,230
gonna radio Rd and we have things in the

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,720
pipeline now for actual revenue revenue

00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,730
generating programs there's work to be

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,300
done on a more stable organizational

00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:59,560
solution but things are really really

00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:03,320
good here I'm not worried about this so

00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,540
what's my question for this year I think

00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:09,620
it's time that we start looking at the

00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:12,070
ganor radio run time so the radio is 18

00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:15,740
years old so it's almost two decades I

00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:18,470
want to say the fact that a scheduler

00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:20,930
that was written in 2001 has made it

00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:24,020
through two decades of SDR work is

00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:26,840
incredible that's a feat of computer

00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:29,120
science I think it's time for us to

00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,770
start talking about what comes next

00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,210
things are changed things have changed a

00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,430
lot right in 2001 everyone thought

00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,810
Moore's law was still very still the

00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,940
thing right that's why even think about

00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,130
was Morse law right I think everyone

00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,920
knows now that Moore's law stead

00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:44,450
so in the leadership community we've

00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:49,880
been talking about this as been radio

00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:51,680
4.0 so and so that's it's not meant to

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,500
be a joke right we're at Caen radio 3.8

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,440
planning for 4.0 where that would be a

00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,940
new runtime release so it's clear now

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,870
that moving forward the future is

00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:05,180
heterogeneous it's parallel and machine

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,130
learnings and play a huge role and

00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,180
there's also just the fields of computer

00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,800
science in software engineering have

00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,090
advanced significantly in the last 20

00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,660
years everything like developer

00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:17,900
experience and dependency management how

00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:21,050
you deal with client-server designs and

00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:24,160
the cloud and local local nodes how you

00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:27,590
can instrument in debug complex systems

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,970
rules come a long way and I think it's

00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:31,490
time for us to circle back around and

00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,630
think about okay how do we make a good

00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,810
radio scheduler it's gonna last us the

00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,970
next 20 years so we're not under any

00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:40,010
illusions this is going to be a very

00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:45,400
substantial undertaking it's gonna take

00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:49,130
years of effort from a strong team and

00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,720
this week one of the things that we

00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,850
really want to be discussing is the

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,100
organization and planning of this so I

00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:57,380
think we're at the point of asking the

00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:59,090
question what do we need to know I don't

00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,880
I don't think I don't think we know all

00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:03,170
of the things we don't know yet that's

00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,540
what we're trying to figure out is what

00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:07,870
do we need to know in order to figure

00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:10,430
out how to do this so if you have

00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:12,020
thoughts about this if you care deeply

00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:15,710
about this if you have been thinking

00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:18,230
about this coming to talk to me come

00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:19,640
talk to any anybody that's active we

00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,410
want to figure out how to do this right

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,630
as realistically this is going to be two

00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,950
to three years with work and we want to

00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,640
make sure the thing that we produce is

00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:32,840
going to last us about 20 years so I'm

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:37,250
going to end this just with a few a few

00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:39,770
other bits so one of the things we're

00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:43,640
talking about is the idea of offering

00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:45,380
SDR office hours so this would be the

00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,840
radio developers effectively offering

00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:51,350
mentoring or one-on-one office hours for

00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,300
people who are either new to SDR or no

00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:56,990
SDR and are new to contributing to open

00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:59,540
source so we're running a survey to

00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:01,490
gauge interest and gather feedback this

00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,470
got a bunch of press actually about a

00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,510
month ago and there's been a lot of

00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,850
responses but I don't actually know that

00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,100
it got a lot of attention from sort of

00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:14,210
the community that comes here so want to

00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:19,880
highlight this that URL is an L after

00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:23,090
the - that's - L SE u RZ if you're

00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,320
interested in being a mentee or you know

00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,730
somebody who might want to be a mentee

00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,310
or you're interested in being a mentor

00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,360
please fill this out just to be clear we

00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,980
don't know that we're going to do this

00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,690
it represents a significant time

00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:37,370
investment but I think it's a way to

00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,450
expand the community help educate people

00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,710
that want to get involved but perhaps

00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:43,420
don't know where to get started because

00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,420
let's be honest SDR can be really hard

00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,630
the last thing I wanna say is I'm giving

00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:55,040
an open source licensing talk tomorrow

00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:58,100
I want hi so I've made this survey is a

00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,100
five questions survey I suspect it's

00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:03,980
going to be very easy for some of you

00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:06,230
but perhaps very difficult in ways you

00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,940
didn't anticipate if you don't take a

00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,590
couple minutes and what I want to do is

00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,300
show the results of this sort of

00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:14,540
questionnaire at the start of the talk

00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,130
and the goal is to just try to gauge how

00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,950
well do we actually understand the way

00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:24,800
open-source licenses work so this again

00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:26,390
is an L that's - l WT g xk so please

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,860
fill it out and I'll show I'll share the

00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:35,030
results at the beginning of my talk so

00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:36,620
with that are there any questions do we

00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,510
have a good sense of how many people

00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,460
understand the runtime right now and if

00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:43,190
it's really small do you think it's that

00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:46,700
might be to focus on broadening that

00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:49,760
knowledge base yeah how many people

00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,950
understand the runtime so there are

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,990
probably a half a dozen that really

00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:57,920
really deeply understand it and I'd say

00:41:53,990 --> 00:42:01,040
probably dozen more that understand how

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,350
it works but perhaps not why it was

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,300
designed the way it was so altogether

00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,500
you know I'd put it somewhere between 15

00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,030
and 20

00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,400
people who could really contribute to

00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,410
that conversation yeah I mean it's

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,510
pretty so for example the the keynote

00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,700
that Marcus Miller gave you can radio

00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,810
days this year was on the one time

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:23,030
internals and how it was designed it

00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:27,380
works so we I think we have I I agree

00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:28,880
it's it's it's actually I did not think

00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,100
we had as many people either I sort of

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,570
sort of sat down and went through it

00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:39,650
it's actually a pretty sizable yeah

00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:42,560
what's up Dan sorry we're supposed to

00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:47,300
have two floater mics waiting for the

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:51,920
venue to give us a second Thanks is

00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:54,080
there a big release between 3a and the

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,880
schedule change we have not specifically

00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,160
planned for that but we're talking about

00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,400
the scheduler change is for Oh to allow

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,310
for that release pardon swapping out the

00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,410
scheduler and I should say right one of

00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,610
the one of the most difficult parts of

00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:11,230
the conversation about changing the

00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:14,870
runtime is so we're with 20 years of

00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:17,420
application code right that's immensely

00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:19,010
valuable all right I mean that's really

00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,630
where the value if you're gonna think

00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,540
about the value of the code that's

00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:25,190
really where the value is is in all of

00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,350
the modules that have been written

00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:30,110
around gonna radio right

00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:30,470
plus the scheduler does work it just

00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,590
works

00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:36,920
right so we have to find the balance

00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:39,530
between the incredible value of

00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,680
everything that we have and not being I

00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:45,380
think constrained by the design concepts

00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,690
of 20 years ago whether that balance is

00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:51,830
I'm not sure like that I think that's

00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:54,410
what we're trying to figure out is how

00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:56,690
much do we want to maintain and value

00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,290
what we have now versus breaking it for

00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,180
something better

00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:01,760
how good does better have to be in order

00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:04,220
to do that I don't know I mean maybe the

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,480
answer is we don't we maintain backwards

00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,550
compatibility for absolutely everything

00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,110
and we have translation layers right I

00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:13,670
don't know so Marcus so I do happen to

00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,520
have to talk about exactly what the

00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:18,020
plans are on this for tomorrow so yeah

00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,390
come and see me

00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:28,190
I didn't do my slide so this is good

00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:30,000
input other questions no okay fantastic

00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:34,989
thanks so much everybody

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,989
