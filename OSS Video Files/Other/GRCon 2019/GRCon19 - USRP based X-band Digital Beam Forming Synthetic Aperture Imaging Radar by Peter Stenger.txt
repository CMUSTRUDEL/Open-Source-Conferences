Description: 
	USRP based X-band Digital Beam Forming Synthetic Aperture Imaging Radar by Peter Stenger, Michael Blue, Marius Urdareanu, Grant Steans, Nathan Henry, Tyree Lewis

A Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) transceiver is investigated as a digital radar transceiver in an elemental digital beam forming (DBF) up/down converter scheme at X-band that images a scene spatially with signal time division multiplexing (TDM) implemented across multiple input-output (MIMO) transmit-receive elements. This forms a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image of the scene with no moving parts. A wide instantaneous bandwidth (IBW) of 44.8 MHz is achieved with an Ettus Research B200 USRP that transmits and receives linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulses that are synchronized between two transmit antenna elements and eight receive antenna elements forming 16 virtual elements that resolve 1.17 degrees of spatial angular resolution across +/- 8.75 degrees of unambiguous field of view. A peripheral commercial Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) evaluation board is used to generate a one pulse per second (1PPS) timing signal to synchronize the USRP generated waveform with the RF switches that excite each transmit/receive virtual element. A commercial component based up/down converter front end extends the RF carrier frequency of the USRP to 10 GHz at each switched aperture element.

all right my name is Pete Stanger I'm

00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,790
from northrup-grumman in Baltimore

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:27,660
Maryland and over the last five years or

00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,580
so we've been sponsoring a senior design

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,140
project with Florida State University

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:38,910
and FAMU and we've we've had this x-band

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:42,570
radar that investigates our

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,370
image-forming and we've been advancing

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,739
it each year as part of this senior

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,620
undergraduate design project and this

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,360
year the idea was well what can we do

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,399
with a software radio because there's a

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,719
lot of commercial interest in there you

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,850
look at the data sheets they can do a

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,280
lot the bandwidth is modest but you know

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,079
you can do some radar things covers a

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,760
pretty wide frequency band you can up

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,759
convert that to higher frequencies with

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,369
one conversion and things like that so

00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:10,350
it was very appealing from a from an

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,520
idea standpoint let's let's try and see

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,729
how we can get that to work as a as a

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,760
back-end receiver exciter in a in a saw

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,770
a dar that does digital beamforming so

00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,689
myself and mechanical engineer I have an

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,630
RF background but there was four

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,030
students undergraduate students in their

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,600
senior project that worked this this

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,670
past semester so here's an outline of my

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,700
talk I'm gonna go over the goals we

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,350
established for the team goals are based

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,909
on the syllabus for the course there was

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,140
a there was a professor so we had to

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,820
meet the guidelines of the course

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,930
syllabus for this class I got credit for

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,060
it and I'm gonna go over the system

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,470
concept we pursued give you context and

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,990
what we're trying to do big picture

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,720
CONOPS there's a conversion to X band

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,700
component the USRP you know starts to

00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,509
lower I off you can't get the X band and

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,189
to keep a reasonable antenna size you

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,840
know we had to up convert there's an

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,100
electronics module which contains the

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,110
USRP and and other electronics to do the

00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:17,390
full three full thread radar function

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,860
and then I'll go into more USRP centric

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,870
topics like how we generate the waveform

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,750
and how we receive it we're doing some

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,930
my ammo and TDM so we're we're switching

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,159
between antenna elements

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,500
at the same time cordoning of

00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,569
coordinating a waveform so we have some

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,040
timing coordination to do that's a

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,280
challenge and I'll show you the

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,879
measurement see seen we put up to

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,730
fundamentally show things we're working

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,879
and then show the actual measurements

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,430
that the USP USRP produced as the main

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,430
as the heart of the system and I'll go

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,900
through the signal processing we did

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,170
calibration the image formation and then

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,389
some summary of some future work so here

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,030
are the goals so the basic goal the

00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:05,489
top-level goal was to demonstrate

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,709
fundamental SAR type system performance

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,349
with us RP as a back-end receiver

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:13,500
exciter there was there was also several

00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:15,840
sub objectives and and actually on the

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,579
product main project goal one of the

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,129
main ones was their students so they're

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:23,219
in learning mode and one of the one of

00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:25,669
the main goals was to expose them to

00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,560
signal technology signal concepts and

00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:30,299
apply them with some real hardware to

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,310
help help build their skillset as they

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,040
enter enter industry or grad school

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:41,780
wherever they're going so that was

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:44,419
really a an emphasis to here so the the

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,590
we want to demonstrate some sub

00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:49,470
objectives that involve some key radar

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,669
techniques we want to show how we can

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:56,040
create virtual elements from an array so

00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:59,069
to create sixteen elements you don't

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,629
need sixteen point receive horns or to

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:03,090
do that you can do that by creating

00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:05,250
things virtually but so we use my mo

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,019
techniques we also have to coordinate a

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,419
radar wave form with these switched

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,180
elements so there's some TDM involved

00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:14,819
now we have to up convert to so that we

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,949
can up convert to X band so we can get a

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,359
smaller antenna and then show that we

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,579
can do digital beamforming because we

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,070
get quality IQ and the spatial domain to

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,520
form beams or angle drivers for

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,250
scattering in the in the scene and then

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,110
one big thing with with a radar like

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,409
this is you'll see in the CONOPS it's a

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,729
very close range scenario you got to get

00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:37,830
rid of that transmitted leakage so we're

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:40,289
running FM CW so that transmit that

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,639
comes over it you'll get that signal

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,990
it's as high as what you

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,680
so you gotta be able to get rid of that

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,449
it's fundamental and then the other

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,590
thing was how many let's try to put as

00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:55,349
many of the the signal processes

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,300
functions in the in the canoe radio in

00:04:55,349 --> 00:05:00,479
the graphical companion as we can given

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,279
time and straits in the semester and we

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,520
all we're only using cost components

00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:09,419
that you can get commercially so here's

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:15,479
a cartoon of the basic system concept so

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:17,669
what we have is is two line arrays okay

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,900
there's eight elements that are receive

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,000
and there's two on the end that are

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,870
transmitted and this axis and what

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,879
they're gonna do is we're gonna

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,110
digitally form beams these yellow

00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,610
stripes are narrow pencil beams in

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,029
asthma that you form because we have a

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,409
wide very large lambda array in this

00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:36,029
direction in the other direction we just

00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:38,879
have a one dimension so you get these

00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:42,199
striped one dimensional beings in the in

00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:45,449
space then we have another one in in

00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:48,300
elevation and that forms the same thing

00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:51,479
in the orthogonal axis so if you get

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,490
scattered energy at a certain range you

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,990
can form the union of that and then you

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,020
can kind of get a fix on where the

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,930
scattered energy is going to be in in

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,610
the scene the other the other dimension

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,620
so that's two dimensions in space you

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,349
got your your as in your L now down

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,639
range so there's a third dimension so at

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:10,710
different ranges you want to image

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,210
what's at different ranges so it's not

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:18,839
ambiguous so there we use a an LF m

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:21,300
chirp waveform linear frequency

00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,159
modulated waveform and we we have enough

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,949
bandwidth and that was one of the

00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:27,449
critical driving things for the USRP is

00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,889
how much how much instantaneous

00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:32,399
bandwidth can we get out of that because

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:34,080
50 megahertz 5vw is about 29 it's

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,060
equivalent to like a 20 nanosecond pulse

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,389
in the time domain so that means you can

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,159
with one foot per nanosecond that means

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:43,500
you can see things you can discriminate

00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:45,839
things in range about 10 feet apart so

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,210
the more bandwidth you have the more

00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,949
discrimination you can do in range so

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:54,979
really you have here is three dimensions

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,979
available to do to do some imaging

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:04,020
the other the other point to make is

00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,220
there's no moving parts so this is

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,230
static so we're going to form these

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,610
beams by not moving a you know a dish

00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:15,450
mechanically we're going to form these

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:17,190
these these digitally all cots and we're

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,440
gonna be sending out a pulse it's pretty

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,450
long it's ten microseconds long so and

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,570
with the range only 40 feet away that's

00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,500
that's like a 10,000 foot pulse so we're

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,300
going to be transmitting and receiving

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:32,700
at the same time so we really have to

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,700
separate those two two returns so one of

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:39,270
the one of the key concepts understand

00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:42,090
is is that when you do beam forming

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,980
spatially in as an ell it's really

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,290
dictated by how close you can get your

00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,930
elements so in our case we couldn't get

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:52,410
the elements at lambda over two so the

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,660
same way in the time domain we have to

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,370
sample things frequently enough so you

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,950
don't get aliasing that corrupts your

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,720
rendered signal in a digital domain well

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:03,450
in the spatial domain when you sample

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,470
when you sample a scene elementally you

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,850
have to have the root you have to have

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,480
the elements close to close enough

00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:11,880
together or you get grading lobes which

00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,010
distorts your real space so it's it's

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:18,210
it's analogous to corruption it's

00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:21,270
analogous to aliasing in the time domain

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,560
in a spatial domain you get these you

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,360
get these what are known as grading

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,460
lobes in your real space domain so it

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,860
limits how much you can then scan and

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,510
digitally beam form so if you these blue

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,560
traces are basically this separation

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,390
that we are well I'll tell you why we

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,120
have to go with that separation you get

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,520
grading lobes here but at Borst site at

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,560
0 degrees you're fine but you get these

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,790
grading lobes and basically what happens

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,560
as d increases d sine-theta okay what

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,210
happens at these at these other angles

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,590
you can actually have the signals all

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,560
add in phase because they're so far

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:58,200
apart and it's modulo two pi with a wave

00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,390
in free space that you think they added

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,730
other angles so in this case they added

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,680
at minus 20 degrees plus 20 degrees and

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,150
at zero we're where we wanted it so now

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,130
when you do your scanning when you scan

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,019
this over to do your beamforming

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,360
to pull in energy and other scatterers

00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,550
and other angles what happens this this

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,620
moves this way too and it gets into your

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,050
field of view so you're on the ambiguous

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,860
field of view is limited by the spacing

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:25,410
between these elements so so we're

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,389
forming 16 were forming 16 virtual

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,639
elements but we have a transmit here and

00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:32,610
8 receive so what we do is we transmit

00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,910
out 1 we transmit out t1 receiving our

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:38,100
x1 and halfway in between is a virtual

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,810
face center it's like having a transmit

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,449
receive cell right at that position in

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,769
space but but it's really from two

00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,750
apertures so you go halfway in between

00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:48,509
and from a phase standpoint its

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,699
equivalent so you you you go through and

00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:53,430
you out of transmit one and you go in to

00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:55,230
transfer 2 3 4 all the way and you

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,000
create all these phase centers then you

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,440
go in to transmit to you measure all

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,959
these and you create these phase centers

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:06,980
so now you have 16 it's equivalent like

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:09,389
16 to your separate TR cells or TR

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,730
elements and what you're sacrificing is

00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:14,040
time you have to do this instead of

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,620
getting them all at once and having 16

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,569
or 16 separate receivers with 16

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,769
separate antennas and all that extra

00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:21,660
hardware we're doing with one

00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:23,939
transceiver and then we have a switch

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,009
network this which is the time multiplex

00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:28,050
is between them to save hardware but you

00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:30,000
do sacrifice time so that's the best

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:35,550
that's the trade-off so that's how we

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,949
create our virtual elements here's the

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:44,009
hardware so here's the here's the

00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:46,829
antenna array in elevation in azmuth and

00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:48,329
each one of these horns we're the

00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,709
aperture was pretty much dictated by the

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:51,839
horn we could get that was cost

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,910
effective they were these horns are very

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,740
expensive if you just go online and look

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,019
for a metal horn that's plated well we

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,199
found a company that makes plastic horns

00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:04,939
that are plated for $20 each at x-band

00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:07,560
so we arrange those on this on this

00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,389
structure and separated them by they're

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,939
separated by six land and the transmit

00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:13,620
and receive here are three lamina so

00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:15,089
when you transmit out one and receive in

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,269
all these others you create these

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:22,019
virtual phase centers out front for both

00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:25,499
axes and then I'll get into select

00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:28,410
Sonic's module in the second the

00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:30,360
electronics from past years is in this

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:34,920
blue box and so what we did this year we

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,899
said okay let's let's use the b200 USRP

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,170
as a receiver exciter so we're gonna use

00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:42,059
a host and we'll put in waveforms in

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,220
here and transmitted out transmitted

00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:47,850
wave forms get received wave forms and

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,949
coordinate the switching coordinate

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:59,999
those wave forms between transmit

00:11:49,949 --> 00:12:04,220
receive pairs so here's here's a diagram

00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:08,730
of the entire system that we implemented

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:12,389
so there's an FPGA idyllic and if you've

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:15,059
worked with digital n't eval boards but

00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:17,339
we use the nexus 3 eval board - it works

00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:20,790
at 100 megahertz as a clock in it we

00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:23,699
derived a 1 PPS to trigger the USRP to

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,829
kick off the waveform and then the FPGA

00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:28,980
also sends out discretes

00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:30,839
to control as a single pole fourth row

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,059
switch for transmit a single pole

00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,059
sixteenth row switch for the receive so

00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:39,600
we switch these things in concert to

00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:42,329
create these these 16 phase centers

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,100
since the USRP can put out an X band it

00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:48,779
puts out 2 gigahertz and we up convert

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:51,240
that through 2 chainz we do the full

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,309
thread with 2 chains we up convert to 10

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,709
gigahertz with a 7 point 8 gigahertz

00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:57,629
ello and they don't receive we down

00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,879
convert with that say mellow and so

00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:02,069
we're phase cohere and all the way all

00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,379
the way through which is very important

00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:06,089
in a radar because radars basically get

00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:08,129
a phase machine you got it you got to

00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:10,079
control the phase that's what you that's

00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:12,480
what you're measuring so here's a photo

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,929
of the electronics box the component

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:21,480
tree inside so all this all this is

00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:27,089
implemented in in inside there so here's

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,709
a detail of that electronics box here's

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:31,410
a custom power supply that one of the

00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:33,179
students did here's the the mixers the

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,850
up down converter basically mini

00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,680
circuits parts here's the FPGA

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,389
eval board that was used to send

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,190
generate the one PPS and all the

00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:43,860
discretes to the single pole sixteenth

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:48,269
row switch and there's a power amp and

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:51,029
an LNA in here etc so it weren't really

00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:54,810
any size constraints the main constraint

00:13:51,029 --> 00:14:00,569
or main goal was to to use cots parts

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:04,019
that were readily readily available so

00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:06,779
here's the flow graph that we used to do

00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:10,019
the full thread radar function so the

00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:12,449
transmitted part is up here so we

00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,639
created a binary file in MATLAB and you

00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:17,279
can easily create it an octave to and

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,560
then send it into the USRP as the sync

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,850
so this is the transmit section and of

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:25,440
course we want to look at it in the time

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:28,560
domain so we setup up a measuring device

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,660
to instrument to look at it here we

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,319
we've got if we're running at a fifty

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,180
megahertz sample rate we found that the

00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:38,759
highest we could run it at for a sample

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,160
rate was fifty megahertz and get and get

00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,600
consistent performance we tried and we

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,360
couldn't do full so you'll see we

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,160
couldn't do streaming we'd had too many

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,339
under runs and overruns so what we ended

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:54,750
up doing was we just sent out a coherent

00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:56,699
group of samples in one in in packets

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:59,040
and that and then then we were able to

00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:01,230
receive coherently without any dropouts

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,120
so we're at a fifty megahertz sample

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,939
rate which is about that max and we were

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,709
able to since we're IQ complex we were

00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:10,139
able to get up to forty four point eight

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:11,430
megahertz of ivw which is one of the

00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:14,370
most important parameters in the radar

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,920
when you're trying to do ranging so RAF

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:20,189
was two point two coming out of here and

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,670
so going into the radio we have two

00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:25,920
point two gigahertz a carrier two point

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:29,279
two gigahertz with an L FM modulation on

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,829
it and then that comes into the USRP

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,380
source here and then we do the conjugate

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:36,509
multiply weather with a version of the

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,449
transmit so this is the match filter so

00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:41,910
if you take two LF M's two chirps and

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:43,589
you multiply them together and they come

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,300
back at different times you get an if'

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,100
frequency it basically compresses into a

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,740
single frequency so if something comes

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,270
back at a further range and multiplies

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,850
you'll get a higher frequency down at

00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,620
if' at baseband so you can separate

00:15:53,850 --> 00:16:04,680
range within the frequency domain

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:07,140
by how it multiplies out so so one

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,790
receive we take the receive signal and

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,800
then we do a conjugate multiply with

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,200
this with a version of the transmit and

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,710
then we go into the instrumentation and

00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:19,980
take a look at it and again we couldn't

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,720
get to streaming over over the USB with

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:26,190
50 megahertz so what we had to do I

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,570
think it's coming up next oh actually

00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,580
it's going to be after this this is the

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,740
timing this is what we had to do from a

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,120
timing standpoint so the transmit

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,100
signals what we'd have to do is we

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,320
transmitted out of one we receive out of

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,930
one and then what we want to do is have

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,960
a the elephant' waveform synchronized in

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,820
time right there and then and then when

00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,280
we want to get the next virtual aperture

00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,050
where we transmit out of transmit out of

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,530
one and receive and two then we want

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,730
another waveform and so on

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,550
so what we did is we created one

00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:00,480
waveform that had sixteen pulses in it

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:04,620
so it had 8,192 complex samples that

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,690
represent the whole coherent we call

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,030
coherent dwell so everything that goes

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,800
out here is a phase controlled and so

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,500
you get this long pulse that goes out

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:16,320
that has sixteen segments in it and each

00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,760
segment each segment is going to go is

00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,040
going to be coordinated in time between

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,900
a transmit receive pair and then we're

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,300
going to receive those digitize and pull

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,360
out the information we need to form a

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:34,260
beam and as L and then downrange for the

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:36,300
for the three dimensions so here here's

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,360
an example of the instruments we use to

00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,030
evaluate was going what was going on so

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:49,590
up here what you have is this is the

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:51,930
demodulated transmit leakage okay so

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,400
this is clear scene and transmit leakage

00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,630
so what we have here is there's nothing

00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,540
out in the scene so we're looking at

00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,430
free space but we get a huge transmitted

00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,780
signal because when we transmit it just

00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,930
jumps over to the receive and that's

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,250
what we measure so you're going to

00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:07,190
see that thing you can see it's pretty

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,440
hearty the signals that go out from the

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,970
radio the baseband modulation generate

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,880
bad that you serve you can see these are

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,590
the L FM's there's 16 l FM pulses that

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,090
they go out so there's one packet of

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,190
samples that produces all this as a

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,410
binary file that the US RP takes and

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,970
spits out and we coordinate the

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,680
switching for each one of these pulse to

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,840
coordinate with the right transmit

00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,050
receive pair if you look at the

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,690
compressed output after you multiply

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:35,450
after you multiply this with a conjugate

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,440
version of the of the transmit then you

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,180
can see you start to get a lower

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,550
frequency there's a sine wave buried in

00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,380
here that corresponds to the range of

00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:44,300
the transmit which is just really close

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,360
it just leaks right around so you end up

00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:54,050
getting a low frequency so now if you

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:54,590
add if you say okay that appears to be

00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,150
working

00:18:54,590 --> 00:19:00,470
let's set up a scene where what we'll do

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,780
is we'll have a corner reflector of

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,180
course site and then we'll put one off

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,640
an angle and see if we can discern those

00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:10,400
things spatially and also verify that

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,400
they're at the correct range so we're

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:18,740
going to look at the three dimensions of

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:20,990
fundamental capability here so here's

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,770
what we set up in the in a field at the

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:27,350
school right so we used a tri heat or

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,760
reflector because it has a real

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,530
broadband response you don't have to

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,880
line it up perfectly with your transmit

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,130
signal you'll get a return from it

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:41,710
without having to be perfectly perfectly

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:41,710
aligned so when we put that in the scene

00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,980
here's the clear clear scene and a

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,390
transmitted leakage like I showed before

00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:52,940
and then when we put in the corner

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,230
reflectors two corner reflectors and

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,330
then transmitted leakage you see the

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,520
transmitted leakage now just over the 50

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,050
megahertz this is before we compress it

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,370
as change that means we have returns

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,350
that are coming back on top of each

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,900
other and then if you look after it's

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,030
compressed after you multiply it by a

00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,350
conjugate version you can see that it's

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,090
different so there's something happening

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,470
we're getting we're getting the leakage

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,000
but we're also getting returns from

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,009
those two corner reflectors coming back

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,230
which is what we want to see

00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:23,019
so the next thing we did is this is

00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,960
where we we we had to stop here in terms

00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:29,649
of the the using the graphical companion

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,119
and we went into MATLAB but we could

00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:33,399
have easily gone into octave there was

00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,919
there was nothing too fancy here so what

00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,659
the students then did is they took the

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,629
eight hundred eight thousand samples

00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:45,429
that the GRC produces as a binary file

00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:50,649
and and put it into a complex domain

00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:52,360
into into MATLAB the the samples end up

00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,399
getting interleaved so you get you have

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,080
to move them around appropriately with a

00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,460
little bit of code and then we got to

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,610
reshape since we're getting sixteen

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:05,499
pulses we need to buffer them in two 16

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:10,179
16 512 sample groups and then when we

00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:12,490
FFT when we FFT each pulse we can see in

00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:14,499
range the leakage we should be able to

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,929
see in range the leakage and also the

00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:19,330
corner reflectors and be able to discern

00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:22,210
them spatially when we do the the rest

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,279
of the processing where when we extract

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,889
for each 16 pulses when we get the when

00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:30,490
we get the range what we'll be able to

00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:32,799
do is we'll be able to decompose angle

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,749
of arrival in that spatial dome in that

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,200
spatial domain and one very important

00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:41,409
thing is applying calibration to your

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,730
your your boresight corner reflector

00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:45,879
that's that's right at 0 degrees you

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,440
have to you have to calibrate that to

00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,809
that to get rid of all the phase errors

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,970
and in the hardware and then we do an

00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,970
FFT in a spatial domain to get the final

00:21:55,169 --> 00:22:04,389
image formation so here here we are is

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:05,980
this is 16 this is 512 samples for one

00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:09,820
of the transmit receive pair so I just

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,369
picked one I picked number nine there's

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:16,049
16 of them and I'm presenting here the

00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:18,610
FFT of 512 samples of the compressed

00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:21,429
received information through the radio

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,289
so these samples this FFT was performed

00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:26,950
on samples received by the radio full

00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:29,019
thread and as you can see it very nicely

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,070
discerns the leakage and then the corner

00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:32,020
reflector

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,610
that's 40 feet away so if you have 10

00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,070
feet of resolution it turns out that

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,540
guess what this is right about where it

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,430
should be so the corner reflectors here

00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,800
the leakage is here so now very

00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:45,040
important I can I can filter out this

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,500
transmitted leakage because it's at a

00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,560
separate frequency so now what I do is

00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,350
for each one of those 16 pulses I grab

00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:56,920
bit that's been here I grab the peak and

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:59,680
I grab the inq phase and now I form 16

00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,960
ion Q's that and then I'm gonna Fourier

00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,300
transform in the spatial domain and then

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,680
I'll tell me the angle of arrival of the

00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:13,630
energy that came from each corner of

00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:17,410
factor so I'm gonna grab I'm gonna grab

00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:25,750
16 IQs from this FFT bin that's cell

00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:27,130
right there and and before one of the

00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:31,180
things you have to do before you do the

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:35,080
final image formation and say okay if I

00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:37,660
just do a a corner reflector a single

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,510
corner reflector at at boresight that's

00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,860
40 feet away just one corner reflector

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:46,180
what I what I have to do is I measure

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:50,380
the phase the complex values each one of

00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:51,640
the 16 values and because there's going

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,810
to be some variation just due to

00:23:51,640 --> 00:24:00,130
hardware changes and what you'd expect

00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:01,960
is some symmetry across all that all the

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,210
cell's because the path length

00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,010
difference from boresight talked to the

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,350
ones on either side are about the same

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,720
distance so that corresponds to a phase

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,460
that should be about the same so you see

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,440
that there's some symmetry there's

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,850
reasonable symmetry across that on how

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,620
how we have that lined up so so I

00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,600
neglected to mention that earlier so

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:26,320
this this phase response for each

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,390
element represents represents the

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,790
measured phase of a corner reflector at

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,380
boresight and so what you need to do is

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,210
you have to you have to since that's at

00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,490
boresight you have to make those

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,020
amplitudes all equal and have zero phase

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,510
all you do is you take each one of these

00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,370
points multiply it by the conjugate to

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,870
get rid of the phase and then divide it

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,480
by itself to get equal

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:49,200
- and then you take that that conjugate

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,789
multiply and you do that to all all

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,610
future data and that gets rid of that

00:24:51,789 --> 00:25:04,630
corner of that that calibrates youtube

00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:06,220
or site at zero degrees so when we when

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,380
we put in the second corner reflector

00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,029
after doing the cow break the zero to

00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,470
amplitude a one and zero for this guy

00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:13,720
when we put this corner reflector in

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,700
there what you end up seeing is the real

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,419
and imaginary part so this is the real

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:22,750
and imaginary part for 16 of the 16 of

00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:24,370
the range set of the 16 samples that

00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,110
were at the range of this corner

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,419
reflector and as you can see they're

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,700
starting to form a sine wave and so what

00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:32,679
happened what happens is any as a

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,320
scatter it moves further away an angle

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:38,470
space what will happen is that the

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,450
frequency of this increases so the so

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,940
use the Fourier transform to decompose

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:45,070
this into a frequency and the higher the

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,950
frequency tells you where it is in the

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:50,350
angle domain so that's how you discern

00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:52,090
in the angle domain where one more

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,700
corner reflector is relative to the

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:57,039
other to verify fundamental fundamental

00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:04,179
performance so so using the Fourier

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:06,760
transform to decompose this into angle

00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:08,980
of arrival of the energy because each

00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,450
scatter at each angle is going to give

00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,370
you a different sign all stored response

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,529
in the IQ domain and the Fourier

00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,179
transform will decompose this into the

00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:18,309
different frequencies which corresponds

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,590
the different angles of arrival for the

00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:25,510
scattered energy in the scene so this

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:26,830
was the measurement we were at

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,289
physically at five point seven degrees

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,299
and when we did the the beam formation

00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:33,730
or the the the beam formation we got

00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:36,190
another peak at around five point seven

00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:39,010
degrees off here so we're able to in the

00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:41,080
angle domain discern where these two

00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,640
corner reflectors are unfortunately we

00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,440
ran out of time during the semester

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,090
because these are undergraduate students

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,320
they were getting ready to graduate so

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,450
when the semester was ending so there

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,340
was really no it was really no follow-on

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,720
could have done a lot more measurement

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,380
so this was I think this verifies

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,749
fundamental performance which was my

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,389
main goal to

00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:04,599
to achieve for this so summary in

00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:06,969
summary I would I would say that the

00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:11,409
u.s. RP had sufficient face tape

00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:12,969
stability over a coherent dwell of you

00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:14,739
know ten microseconds worth of samples

00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:16,959
on a full thread so we could do digital

00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:19,089
beamforming it was it was it was face

00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:22,479
stable enough we couldn't do the

00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:24,579
streaming over fifty megahertz with the

00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:28,359
USB three we had to send out this packet

00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:30,099
they had all sixteen pulses in it one

00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:31,989
thing we noticed is that us par P the

00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:33,519
phase starts at a different value every

00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:35,559
time you said you sent out a set of

00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,089
pulses and collect the data it starts

00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:38,769
out with a different phase but for

00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:40,450
beamforming all you care about is the

00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:41,919
relative phase between the pulses you

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,169
don't really care about absolutely where

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,940
they start it's the phase change over

00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:47,709
the pulses that you're trying to get so

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,440
that didn't matter

00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:52,119
you need sufficient ibw bandwidth to

00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,070
separate out the transmit leakage so

00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:55,839
whatever leaks across you have to get it

00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,849
rid of that in the range domain so you

00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:01,739
can pick the samples off of them at the

00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:07,149
range that you're interested in that

00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:09,849
imaging and then the other thing we we

00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:11,679
discovered is that with the one PPS that

00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:14,769
launches the waveform out of the radio

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,450
well okay that's great but there's a

00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:17,919
delay when you say radio give me a

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,419
waveform there's a delay from when that

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,089
waveform actually comes out the spicket

00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:23,889
of the radio so there was an extra delay

00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:26,019
we had to empirically determine what it

00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:29,049
was and I think a better way to do that

00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:31,059
in the future is how the one PPS

00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:32,349
launched the waveform but at the output

00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:35,289
of the radio the transmitted signal

00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:37,690
couple off and detect a signal have a

00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:39,639
have a detector that detects an edge and

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,049
then there's a discreet from the FPGA

00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:43,269
that says okay start the switching

00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:45,959
between the elements that would be a

00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:49,450
better way to do it in the in the future

00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:53,169
and for the future another item for the

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:57,129
future is we could we could collect data

00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:59,499
over different RF RF bands by moving the

00:28:57,129 --> 00:29:02,679
carrier around and stitched together the

00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:03,820
art the the measured response with

00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:05,169
different carriers because these

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,089
different carriers work of course would

00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:09,159
increase our ibw and try to stitch those

00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:10,690
together and then finally we could add

00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:11,350
some of the process functions from that

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,419
lab or

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:18,880
right into the GRC modules but we didn't

00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:20,050
we didn't have time that's that's all

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:26,089
thank you

00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:26,089
