	Man or Machine?: Developing a "Turing Test" for Radio Intelligence by Adam Anderson

A key feature of next-generation communications is the ability of radios to not just operate in, but collaborate through, congested spectrum. In recent years, radios have moved well beyond simple cognition like that found in classical approaches to dynamic spectrum access. With the recent multi-disciplinary interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, radios are becoming more intelligent at all layers of the protocol stack. In fact, we have shown previously through experimental hardware the so-called deepmod: a radio with the ability to design, train, and operate a PHY layer protocol with minimal traditional signal processing blocks. A natural question for deepmod often arises: How does a machine-generated PHY compare with a human-invented PHY which itself has made great strides in adaptability? However, this work attempts to move beyond this question, instead: What behavior must a radio exhibit in order to qualify as intelligent rather than merely resilient or adaptive? Through experimentation with software radios, we explore this, and other, questions related to next-generation machine-assisted communications and radio links.

so there's a lot of hype going on with

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:24,029
AI a machine learning it's permeating

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,840
you know all fields all research science

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,349
commercial it's everywhere

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,720
so why not communications too so in fact

00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:32,739
right now doctor is doing a grand

00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,710
challenge called the spectrum

00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:39,420
collaboration challenge the ideas how

00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:42,579
can we use AI to access the spectrum I

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,559
have a team one of the finalists work

00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:47,560
next month we're heading to the Mobile

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,920
World Congress to to crown the champion

00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:54,610
in this competition and when I when I

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,380
started this I had this fantasy right

00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,030
this fantasy of we're gonna make this

00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,790
chip smart right we're going to take

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,320
software radios we can go down into just

00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,290
as deep as we can go and we can make it

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,479
as smart as possible but then what

00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,680
happened is all the teams got together

00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,890
we had a lot of arguments about

00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,909
compliance right in order to participate

00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,009
in this competition you had to be

00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,180
compliant right so radio is that that

00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,590
weren't good enough they would just

00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,520
remove from the competition so there's a

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,200
lot of talks about compliance which

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,929
which ended up being okay because

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,609
because I've always in my mind this is

00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:34,259
this is kind of my vision of radios of

00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:36,609
the future whereas right now you have

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,509
these stickers that go on wants devices

00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:40,060
have you ever seen this where it says

00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:41,259
you can't transmit so much power and you

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,429
have to be able to accept that all right

00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,899
so this is this little sticker on the

00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:45,819
left right we see that all the time when

00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,469
wireless devices that's really dumb

00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:50,289
right essentially what they're saying is

00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:53,499
intelligence is just don't transmit very

00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:56,649
very strong okay so what ended is in the

00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:58,719
future all wireless devices are gonna

00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,670
have the sticker on the right which says

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,229
that you need to demonstrate a certain

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,060
amount of intelligence in order to

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:05,859
access our spectrum then you need to be

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,979
able to respond to intelligence right

00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:10,780
that makes a lot more sense but what is

00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,840
radio telling the intelligence that's

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,390
what we're going to talk about so I

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,200
focused on it just to make it easier to

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,099
talk about rook's done in three areas

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,680
regarding radio intelligence the work

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,560
the vs. wearing when to transmit that's

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,700
kind of your cognitive radio idea if

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,690
there's a there's an opening of the

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,820
spectrum I'm going to try

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,320
that there raise the lord your power

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,280
adapt when to transmit things like that

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,830
so that one is kind of what the DARPA

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,990
challenge is all about is it's kind of

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,890
just higher higher layer of intelligence

00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,160
which is not what I'm going to talk

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,290
about today on the right I broke out I

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,760
broke out bits I wanted bits to be its

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,530
own thing right so as soon as you get to

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,060
bits

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,030
whether it's error correction or

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,250
encryption or what the bits mean to me

00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,210
that's something else and what we're

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,850
gonna talk about today is what's in the

00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,370
middle which is how to transmit the bits

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:06,460
across the channel all right so that's

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,800
waveforms spreading hopping things like

00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,330
that okay so that's so when I talk about

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
radio intelligence today even though I

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,570
understand that it spans all parts of

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,670
this today we're getting sent you talk

00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:22,200
about the physical layer intelligence so

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:25,870
so this is this again this is my dream

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,910
there was a guy named James Maxwell very

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,180
famous he has a cool set of equations

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:33,400
that are important to what we do

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,950
he also had this philosophical concept

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,120
called Maxwell's demon Maxwell's demons

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,690
that dizzy if you have a little demon in

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,760
a box and he can control this gate and

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,530
as soon as a fast molecule or a hot

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,330
molecule gets close to the gate you let

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,550
it through if the cold molecule comes

00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,900
through he'll shut the trap so keep all

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,860
the cold molecules on one side all the

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:56,230
haa Moloch is on the other side and then

00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,970
entropy is violated right so physicist

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,019
don't like that that's called Maxwell's

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:04,570
demon so my idea was coms diamond right

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,360
so let's say we had a demon now inside

00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,519
of a universal hardware and what this

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,930
demon does is you you put this Hardware

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,610
into some environment and you give it

00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,650
some objectives and let's say that

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,049
objective is minimize your your bit

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,350
errors right so you give the demon a bit

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,210
and the demon goes through and decides

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,720
exactly what the sample needs to be for

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,460
that bit and for all previous bits and

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,740
then he transmitted that sample across

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,800
the wireless channel right so you get

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,240
rid of you you have tracked out all of

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,010
essentially communications all the

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,560
filtering and so on you abstract it down

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,980
this demon just takes bits and he spits

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,140
out samples

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:49,230
all right so that's comms demon that's

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:51,390
what we're trying to make so so I that's

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:54,090
why I tried to make it right

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,100
I tried to make this little demon guy so

00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,330
what I did was I got my myself my

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:03,930
software radio Guinea radio and I broke

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,700
out these three parts of intelligence up

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:10,320
there at the top that's where the bits

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,600
come in it's just a socket that you can

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,560
connect any sort of application that you

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,030
want to that also has the same socket

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,160
bits come in that bottom layer there is

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,200
kind of well it's kind of the where win

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
you know you set the frequencies at the

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,900
bandwidth you set the sample rate set

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,980
the power that's kind of the hardware

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,540
but where all the action happens is

00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,250
right there in the middle that's where

00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,430
the demon lives right so that DMA is

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,620
going to take bits from the from the

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,660
application and it's going to turn that

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,870
directly into samples which is going to

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:47,750
turn transmitted across the channel ok

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:50,880
so that's the goal so so I did this

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,590
these was also actually from 2018 so

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,730
they're a little bit old I presented him

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,510
last time but just to go over it again

00:05:53,730 --> 00:06:00,180
just so you remember where we're at so

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,700
the first thing I did was I I made the

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:08,970
demon we call it deep mod for

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:10,950
demodulation and we coded it up and we

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,320
put it in some hardware for fun we we

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,980
used a speaker microphone system so

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:21,030
rather than using RF energy or or

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:22,110
antennas we use sound just because we

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,060
actually wanted to listen to it learn

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,790
how to how to talk we wanted to hear

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,100
what it what it came up with so instead

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,090
of bits we use phonemes so like the

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,400
English language and so we you we have

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,470
these two nodes here these two deep mud

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,420
nodes with their software radios we turn

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,870
them on and they start talking to each

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,740
other over the air and after some amount

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,700
of time they arrive at a shared language

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,210
that they then use to communicate

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:56,320
information that's fun to listen to

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:58,360
we took that same demon deep mod and we

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,200
put it over the power line so that is

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,990
you throw out the the speakers and the

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,510
microphones and we just plug our little

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,770
b210 there dribbling to the wall so if

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,900
you have a power outlet over here you

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,640
plug in over here there's a power outlet

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,190
over here you're on the power line

00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,300
channel we turn them on they start

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,890
sending energy back and forth to each

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,530
other they don't know what that energy

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,660
is at first but after a few training

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,980
epochs they've decided this is what

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,480
you're trying to tell me and they've

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:31,420
come up with a physical layer protocol

00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:35,050
that can communicate with each other and

00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:37,120
then finally the classic RF channel now

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,410
now we put in now we put in tenez onto

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,590
the radios we crank up the frequency to

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:50,170
900 megahertz and we start transmitting

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:52,750
okay so remember that there is no signal

00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,890
processing going on right that one new

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:59,170
radio block which is a neural network

00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:01,090
takes care of all all the processes

00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,110
right it learns everything it needs to

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,320
about the channel in order to

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:11,980
communicate this wirelessly it's pretty

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:14,620
cool fun to watch so so as I showed this

00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,820
to people nobody believes nobody

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:22,420
believes it works which is fine

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:24,550
in fact I come from academia and I ran a

00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,080
simulation with deep mod and I'm like

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,150
whoa this is cool I mean this this

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,300
machine is learning it's essentially

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:34,930
replacing all this human code it's just

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,670
learning it itself and and so I'm like I

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,830
got stopped doing simulation it was too

00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,490
fantastic right it's too it's too

00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,010
unbelievable

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,330
so after one simulation I just went

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,100
straight to over-the-air from then on

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,310
out right I had to actually build it and

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,080
do it or nobody would believe me so so

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,600
some questions I don't like so don't ask

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,460
me this what does the deed mod constant

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,470
I hate this question there is no

00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,330
consolation right there's no idea of

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,310
constantly right the machine just

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,010
decides directly how to map the bits to

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,710
the samples there's no intermediate I

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,840
constellation what equalizer does it

00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,340
there's no equalizer right

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,700
it just takes care of that one of its

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,590
network layers I don't know where it's

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,900
in there somewhere

00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,390
how does the handle Kirk carry your

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,060
frequency offset aha right they think

00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:26,230
they've got me what about CFO I don't

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,490
know it just does I a lot of a lot of

00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,340
these machine learning people want to

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,840
know why can the machine tell you that

00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,700
that's an apple that's an orange right

00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,150
why do they do that that's called metal

00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:40,990
I can meta learning I don't care cuz it

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:42,220
works ok the other question I don't like

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,740
is that yes well how does it compare

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,430
against you know a human system right so

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,260
humans have spent a long time on digital

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,350
comms and you're saying we're just going

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,530
to throw out all the humans replace them

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,210
with machines so how does it compare so

00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:02,740
the reason don't like this is I can't

00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,910
win I can't win this right if I say that

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,580
in simulation the mud is little bit

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:09,460
worse and say you know bpsk awgn they're

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,880
like ha there's worse like yeah yeah ok

00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:16,240
I mean because PBS kids optimal in this

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,810
very simplistic channel if I do it over

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,790
the air and then deed month is better

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,440
then people are incensed and they said

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,300
well if you were just a change or

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,710
equalizer or if you were to tweak beta

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,760
or you to do this and there's no y all

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,960
that you we've all played this game

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,060
right you tweet all these parameters

00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,700
then maybe the human machine would be

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,970
better which is true but that's whole

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:40,320
point mine didn't have to do that right

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:45,910
he learned on its own how to communicate

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:49,090
no point so what we should ask is is the

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:53,800
mod intelligent right is this radio is

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:55,870
an intelligent radio so so we have a

00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,010
couple things that we can that we can go

00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,010
off go off of in the past

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,470
something's called the Turing test right

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,690
I think we've all heard this before and

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,580
it's it a test of a machines ability to

00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,380
exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,430
to or indistinguishable from that of a

00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:18,050
human so for example the imitation game

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,120
so if your your your tuned a here and

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:23,450
you're playing survivai oh you know you

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,860
guys play it right fortnight's down you

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:30,830
got to play something so you go pick for

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,790
it and so it can be so you're hiding in

00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,790
the house can be is outside the house

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:37,460
and you want to figure out if to be is a

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,980
bot or if it's a or if it's a human

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,420
right how do you do that well yes get a

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,640
series of questions and depending on how

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,960
it responds you decide oh you're a human

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,850
or you're not even me

00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,950
so you say hey hey you want to team up

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,410
and if Team B says sure come come out of

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,820
that house they own some stuff right you

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,730
got to decide with that is that a

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,130
boggart human obviously a bot because

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,700
it's filled own with an O instead of a P

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,920
right so don't don't you stay in that

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,050
house right so the hard part of the

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,690
Turing test is figure out what the

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,630
questions are what what's the suite of

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,160
questions were that we're gonna ask and

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,210
then based on the responses how are we

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,340
gonna determine whether that's a human

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,580
right so that's not those are the hard

00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:21,530
parts of the Turing test

00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:24,350
next we have the the CAPTCHA test which

00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,580
we've all seen and this is you know

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,770
you're you're registering for some

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,230
website they run this test by you kind

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,610
of figure out whether you're a human or

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,260
not because I don't they don't they

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,480
don't want BOTS filling up their in

00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,860
their database or something so it's kind

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,560
of a counterpart to the Turing test the

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,210
CAPTCHA test is now a computer deciding

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:48,020
if you're intelligent rather you

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:49,820
deciding whether and then there's

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,910
something I call the the dr. Anderson

00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:57,620
test so I'll teach a class on machine

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:59,000
learning and everybody loves it not

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,460
because I'm teaching it because machine

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,260
learning is just this great thing and

00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,760
and I encourage them as one of the

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,050
projects is to apply machine learning to

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
whatever they're doing I don't care what

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,650
you're doing I don't I don't care

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,990
whatever your field of study is apply

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,420
machine learning to it so these students

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,130
will come to me and they'll say dr.

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,650
Anderson do you think

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,420
code this up to automatic classifier

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,460
bring some data said to me or some

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,530
picture or something they'll say let's

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,960
say can we make a machine classify this

00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,600
right and so my first question is what

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,210
can you classify it because if you can

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,470
classify it chances are we can come up

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,970
with the machine that can classify it as

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,090
well all right so that's my first at

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,170
this can you do it so for example this

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,280
digit here on the left that's a zero

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,160
right

00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,840
so if Sudan were to come to me and say

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,130
hey look you know can we can we come up

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,020
with a machine that can classify these

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,150
digits the question is what can you

00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,590
classify it like yeah that's obviously a

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,230
zero well then we can come up with

00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:56,380
machine to classify to this image in the

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:58,600
middle this is a this is data from ure

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,120
unintended radiated emissions all

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,990
electrical devices radiate something

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,270
whether intentional or not and so he'd

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,860
been working on it so long that he could

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,000
look at this this data set here in the

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,950
middle and he could say that's

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,650
fluorescent lights right and not a

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,430
monitor and not an Xbox right just

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,850
because you've been working on this

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,040
alone

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,260
so when he comes to me and says shows me

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,430
this picture says you know can we can we

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,750
create a machine that will just tell us

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,820
that this is for us in live

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,650
I asked the mole can you fake it do you

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,230
know what's fluorescent lights and he's

00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:33,780
like yeah we can make a machine to do it

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,780
and we did the picture on the right

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,050
that's my little girl my second little

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:46,750
girl

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:48,970
I named her Shannon after guess who all

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,410
saw the Tesla but not named after the

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:55,390
car because that they end up with the

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:57,880
car so I didn't know this before this is

00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,170
I maybe I'm new to PowerPoint but if you

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,240
put an image in the PowerPoint it'll

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,790
it'll suggest text I'll text have you

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,930
guys ever done this so I have pasted

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,090
this picture into PowerPoint and this

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:11,380
was the text that Microsoft suggested a

00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:14,430
girl on a swing right wrong right she's

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,430
not on the swing what is she doing

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:25,650
what is he doing kento not a very good

00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:27,780
image um she's not on the swing but

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:30,750
she's doing just there's two issues one

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,760
is but she's holding is too rigid and

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,840
it's made of wood look in the background

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,720
there's these things on the ground

00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,130
called leaves right so if you're gonna

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,850
take that into account that the fact

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,410
that there's leaves in the background

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,830
and she's holding something rigid you'd

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:46,020
actually say a girl holding a rake right

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,390
that would be a better caption for that

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,950
image right so if Microsoft came to me

00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,060
and said well you dr. Anderson do you

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,500
think we could ever come up a machine

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,060
that can classify this correctly not say

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,970
I'm Microsoft you know go try again

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,560
but try again because you can do it

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,000
therefore Vinci will be able to make

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,440
machine that will classify that

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,360
correctly so so what do we have we have

00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,190
the Turing test which is a human

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,480
guessing if a computer's a human to

00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,180
capture test which is a computer

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,890
guessing if they fuming at the computer

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,750
and then we have dr. Anderson's test

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:19,200
which is if a human can do it and so can

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,630
you compute right so and just one

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,430
observation that that determining what

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,160
determining whether a radios intelligent

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,340
or not might be easier than human tell

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,860
with intelligence because we don't care

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,630
how the radio does it as long as the

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,650
behaviors similar to what a human does

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,960
does that make sense

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,730
whereas with the Turing test how they

00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,700
say it and what they say is as important

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,530
as what the answer is for radiant

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,780
elegance we don't care right the radio

00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:48,590
doesn't have to come up with OFDM if we

00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,330
give it the objective of beating of

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,530
frequency selective fading right I was

00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,600
talking as it comes up with something to

00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:58,380
defeat it that's good enough that's an

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:01,860
intelligent radio so for now just just

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:04,500
for the purposes of this this talk we're

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,910
gonna say a radio system is intelligent

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,800
if if a human given in a limited amount

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:15,030
of time could derive a similar system

00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,770
similar behavior for the that in

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,660
particular environment okay

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,550
so if I put this radio in some funky

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,770
environment and I turn it on into

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,640
functions well and if he Gila could come

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,290
along as well

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,820
model the environment spent a lot of

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,290
time write a lot of papers get a lot of

00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,660
funding go through this entire process

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:32,970
and come up with a radio system that

00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,260
that's similar then we'll say okay well

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,549
the mold the radio was intelligent right

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,059
it came up with with what the human

00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:41,580
might have come up with as well so we

00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,410
have man versus demon okay so the next

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,270
few slides I apologize there are four

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,440
non-technical people so you guys are

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,440
gonna roll your eyes at this and I

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,890
apologize but it's important for for one

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,630
point so what I say is is this little

00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:59,910
black cloudy thing represents four bits

00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:02,490
okay and it's a clock as it's noisy

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,409
right so we would have put sixteen of

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,970
these things into this little fenced

00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:08,789
area right and we wouldn't put them as

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,409
far apart as possible because if they

00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,760
get close together and if they ever over

00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:14,250
that we get Bader's and bit errors and

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,169
that's bad okay so I asked them I say

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,179
how would you arrange sixteen of these

00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:20,250
little black cloud of things into this

00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:23,190
square so that they're as far apart as

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,380
possible right it's a little thought

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,110
exercise and really you think you can

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,059
ask a six robeson and they they can come

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,909
up with a an arrangement of sixteen of

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:35,250
these so they're as fallen far as far as

00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:39,539
possible and we've done it right it's

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,380
called 16 crammed and the reason it's

00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,880
shaped like that's because the human

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,690
came along and decided that that's the

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,400
optimal the maximum distance so I gave a

00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,320
machine as an exact exact same problem

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,409
so I went to I went to the machine and I

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,890
said I created some neural network and I

00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:56,909
said here's some noisy symbols I pass

00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,010
them through the neural network and he

00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:00,840
said how would you arrange it right if

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,940
you were gonna do it right so this is

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,130
what the machine came up with yep 16

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,169
qualms of course I did because that's

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,270
what you would do right it's a little

00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:10,950
crooked maybe if I let it run for a

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,320
little longer it would have evened up

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,640
and come up with a so actual what I

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,440
would had to do actually what I would

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,480
have had to do is make it noisier right

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,610
because if that's as much noise as there

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,250
is it thinks that's good enough so it

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:27,570
stops you know there's no overlap I'm

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:29,280
done so now though let's put it in a

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,169
different environment right so now

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,630
instead of having nice you know white

00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,549
noise we have correlated noise for

00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:38,070
whatever reason I made it up maybe

00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:40,470
there's more noise in the real direction

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,700
than in the imaginary direction right so

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,140
now if you were to put these sixteen

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,960
symbols in this environment

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:49,090
that's bad you do very poorly right lots

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,809
of overlap it wouldn't perform very well

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:54,220
but you're stuck with 16 gram because

00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:57,970
that's what you that's what the human

00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,850
coded it up right but the Machine the

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,020
machine doesn't know about 16 crammed it

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,600
just knows about what environments it's

00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,549
in so if we put the machine in the same

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,980
environment this is what it comes up

00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:10,990
with instead right so instead of 16

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,650
clown that comes up with some weird 8 by

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:16,330
2 clamp because that maximum that makes

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,919
it happy that makes machine happy that

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:22,270
it maximizes the objective function of

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,350
lowering the bit error rate okay so the

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,990
same Qian remember this is exactly

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,130
machine the code did not change no part

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,659
of a change the only thing I change was

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,880
the environment that it was in right so

00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:32,590
you move the demon from here to here

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,409
comes up with the entire different

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,730
physical nerve okay so now this is

00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:39,610
important very important take this this

00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:42,179
is the takeaway so you can say well we

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:45,460
could have made a rate of that that had

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,470
modulation adaptation right maybe had 16

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,720
km and BPSK in it and we would have just

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,309
switch the BPSK and that's cool

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,870
that have been very that would have been

00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,600
adaptive right if you can do that what

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:58,059
we'll call that adaptation right but

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,669
inventing a PI to clamp in sits you on

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:03,220
the fly that's intelligence right

00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:06,340
because it didn't exist it didn't exist

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:09,460
and tells it was it was made to learn

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:15,090
that and then it becomes intelligence

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:18,280
okay so what we need to do then is is

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,929
again this is just I'm not saying this

00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,350
is how things should be this is what I

00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:26,440
did I came up with a suite of tests

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:30,070
questions that I'm going to ask my radio

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:33,520
and then see how it replies that to

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:36,100
figure out if it's intelligent or not so

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,000
I came up with I didn't do a I'm not

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:43,780
showing you all of them but I came up

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:46,210
with a few and here's the first one so

00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,549
the first one is if we take our radios

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,600
and let's say we put it into a congested

00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:50,740
environment so let's say there's a

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,880
narrowband jammer there for whatever

00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,780
reason right so you have two radios

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,210
environment narrowband jammer

00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,520
what would a human do

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:02,070
well in this case a human maybe it makes

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,340
a notch filter on the front end you know

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,810
remove remove that interference if it's

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,030
the north the end system maybe it

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,380
suppresses that carrier right so it

00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,860
doesn't transfer there's a lot of things

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:16,410
a human might do to solve the problem so

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,000
I did this with with DEET mod got my tea

00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,370
radios put him in the environment turn

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,080
on the jammer so what you see over here

00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,720
at this plot on the right is the

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,040
performance of the mod versus time so

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,890
when you first turn it on it does

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,410
terribly takes about 200 epics and it

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,420
trains up 200% it's sending bits across

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:37,110
the channel perfectly right all on its

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:40,070
own at about epoch 400 I turned the

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:43,170
jammer on kills the communications right

00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:45,450
but it doesn't stop learning so give it

00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,400
a few few hundred more epochs episode

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,770
and with the jammer there it's

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,030
communicating again okay not because we

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,300
ever taught it to communicate with the

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:58,140
jammer because it's hot itself how to

00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,910
communicate with the jammer so the

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,400
question was how are you gonna react to

00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,140
jammer this is its response and we have

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,850
to decide was that an intelligent

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,140
response what about it what about a

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:16,020
relay channel right get a get a little

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:19,170
funky here right so I had a really

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:22,170
simple I don't work with relay channels

00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,870
I'm not an expert I just got a third

00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,790
node it's dumb just amplifying refurb

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:30,300
just amplify in forward relay channel so

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,530
whatever signal it gets it moves to

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,180
frequency down a little bit and then

00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:35,580
retransmits it right that's all that

00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,780
really does and there's a lot of work if

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,040
you google this there's a lot of work of

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,210
what humans have done for the amplifier

00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:46,020
uhm i'm fiying forward relay channel so

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:47,970
what did mod did was so I said much so

00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,490
they're far apart so they can't there's

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,660
no direct communication right they can

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,850
only communicate through the relay in

00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:57,780
the middle they start training back and

00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:59,850
forth through the relay and and honestly

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,950
it didn't it didn't even affect it at

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,320
all right they had no idea they had no I

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,580
did they were in a relay because I never

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,960
told him that they just learned to

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,960
communicate with the relay

00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:16,370
so I call this the lone survivor Channel

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,920
I've never seen the movie but apparently

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:21,960
somebody these guys get caught behind

00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,030
behind enemy lines or something and then

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,310
they they they can't read each have

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:31,050
radios but it can't reach headquarters

00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:32,690
this is even close and the idea is well

00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:36,150
maybe if they were able to cooperate

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:38,600
then they would have been able to reach

00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,830
home base or something

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,850
so what would a human do in this case

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,440
both there is something called the

00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:47,640
co-operative MIMO channel right and

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,730
maybe maybe these radios could change

00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,340
Sheriff CSI with each other we've got

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:56,790
some really good synchronization you

00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:59,640
could learn to transmit transmit so bait

00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:01,440
so the signals constructively add

00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,430
over-the-air and then you could get you

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,400
know some gain out of it right

00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:08,640
cooperative mine so what did you might

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,560
do so in this case what I did was I got

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,330
a third node again now I made it smart

00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:16,830
so I took that dumber you'll a wiped it

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:18,540
installed deep mud on it and and this is

00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,930
this was amazing I mean this was amazing

00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:24,030
the the only change I made was two of

00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:26,250
the nodes I called him deep mod 0 right

00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,630
so they both think they're deep mod 0

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,660
and they didn't know what I called deep

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:34,560
Mach 1 and then I turned them all on at

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,670
the same time so they start talking

00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,540
about comport start training each other

00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,250
and how to communicate over the air and

00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,360
at first is just nonsense right because

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:47,370
that's they all sort out what they don't

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,350
understand how to send information but

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,830
then eventually the two deep mud zeros

00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:54,930
they eventually started lining up their

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,730
transmissions on their own so that they

00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,410
got the extra gain out of out of the

00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,110
cooperation and it was really fun to

00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,780
watch it's fun to watch that in in and I

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,950
just did this in the morning right just

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,210
one morning I thought oh I wonder I

00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:10,880
wonder if it would work this way right

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:10,880
so again is that intelligent

00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,940
mobility same idea of what happens if if

00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:21,059
you if you take you're intelligent

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,839
you're supposedly intelligent radio and

00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:28,009
now you start moving around what happens

00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:30,690
so mobility causes fading and

00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:33,059
environment changes humans have been

00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,259
looking at this for a while there's a

00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:39,509
lot of solutions on how to handle

00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:41,989
mobility for deep Maude I put one of the

00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:44,009
nodes in a hotel room I put the other

00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:48,229
deep mud in the back of a car and we

00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:48,229
just start driving around town with it

00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:54,419
it's cool and what we found is that it's

00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:55,559
very similar to to the jammer is that if

00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,609
you drive around a corner or something

00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:01,559
if you change if you change the

00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:03,569
environment a lot it would it would stop

00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,949
communicating and tell the train for a

00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:07,349
little bit and then it would get back up

00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:09,299
to normal so and eventually I'm sure

00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:12,239
there's a there's a velocity where where

00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:18,949
you couldn't train fast enough to keep

00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:23,099
communications going this one was fun I

00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:24,899
I thought well what if what if we want

00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,519
to require that deep Maude is awful

00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:28,049
narrowband for whatever reason right so

00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,389
I googled I a good old narrowband

00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:34,649
spectral envelope and I got some picture

00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:37,709
over them the left and and I thought

00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:38,819
well what would a human do to have an

00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:39,749
envelope like this well usually the

00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:41,849
envelope just comes from whatever

00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:43,109
modulation you're using just kind of

00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:45,299
natural consequence so it's kind of

00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:46,499
silly question but if you wanted to you

00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,759
could you could take your packets you

00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:50,609
could pulse you could you could package

00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,829
shape to get to get a shape like that

00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:54,029
you could add artificial noise to get

00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:55,829
the little side lobes if you want I mean

00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:57,059
there's things you could do so that

00:27:55,829 --> 00:28:00,029
whatever you're transmitting looks like

00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:02,190
that image on the left right so what did

00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:03,539
you buy dude well I told you mod go ed

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,119
and keep minimizing the bit error rate

00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:07,349
that's what I want you to do but I

00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,059
picked certain points in the spectrum

00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:10,559
and I said why you're minimizing the bit

00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:12,059
error rate I also want you to look like

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,459
this okay

00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:16,079
so I turned it on and and he starts out

00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:19,440
pretty pretty flat but it's fun to watch

00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,149
him as he's training with you but with

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,229
the other node that this spectrum kind

00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:24,179
of started dropping down and looking

00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:25,800
like what you wanted to yeah I really

00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,930
like this a little dimple in the middle

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,370
a little dimple at DC I thought that was

00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:34,680
kind of cute that that had decided to

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:36,510
put that a little dimple there and then

00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,000
the last test nonetheless that's left us

00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,520
I'll share with you guys is spectral

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,410
efficiency so again this put some radios

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,850
in an environment teach them how to talk

00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:49,110
or have them learn how to talk and then

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:52,380
tell them that that they're allowed to

00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,940
have more samples per symbol or lower

00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,730
spectral efficiency see what they do

00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,360
right now humans and then lot humans

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:03,900
have been working on this forever

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,460
different types of codes you could you

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,570
could spread spread the bits a little

00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,860
bit get a little bit of performance that

00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,410
way so there's a lot a lot of things you

00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:14,240
could do if you give the radios some

00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:18,200
extra spectral efficiency to work with

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,830
so with deep pod I did the same thing I

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:26,460
got some baseline I call it uncoated and

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:31,500
then III had it relearn retrain at

00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:34,860
different it's hard because it's not

00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,270
really a code rate for the 1/2 and 1/3 I

00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,640
told you mod you could have twice as

00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:43,350
many samples for class or three times of

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,330
any samples per class and so then what

00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:48,900
it did was it learned that with that

00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:52,740
extra freedom you can you can lower your

00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:54,420
bit error rate more right which is

00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,010
pretty cool just neat that that uh that

00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:59,670
it learned how to do that on its own

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:02,280
without being told and so I just think

00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,620
and you know if Shannon and Turing was

00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:09,600
to it we're still alive right

00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:11,400
I could see Shannon making fun of Turing

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,800
saying oh you know what we already at

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,440
machines that pass your tests like like

00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,390
like it's no big deal but then turning

00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:23,640
can tell Shannon well a machine just

00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:25,260
told us that a perfect SNR and rate code

00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,630
rate you can get an arbitrary low bit

00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,810
error rate and they can Duke it out

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,550
about how the machines are taking over

00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:35,340
not just physical labor and stuff but

00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:37,820
machines are taking over intellectual

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,820
discoveries

00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:44,580
so conclusion in the future I suspect

00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,399
that there will be bands a spectrum that

00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,080
will require some some form of

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,590
intelligence in order to be allowed to

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,360
access it so we need to have a task we

00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:58,139
need to develop a test that says whether

00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,980
or not a radio is intelligent I think

00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,450
that's our responsibility that's

00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,369
something that we should we should take

00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:05,190
the lead on is defining what is an

00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:08,009
intelligent radio so the idea is we need

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,789
to give these radios this test asking

00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:12,029
these questions put in these

00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:14,700
environments see how they respond to it

00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:17,609
and then we decide yes that's sufficient

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:28,950
intelligence to call the radio and

00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:31,559
intelligent review hi thanks for the

00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:34,169
talk it was interesting what if you were

00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:36,419
to set the objective to be undetectable

00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:40,889
or like try to make it come up with

00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:42,200
stenographic protocols like noise yeah I

00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:44,369
do have multiple objective functions

00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,529
machines you know take that strides that

00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:48,419
we do in fact I've given deep mod six

00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:51,600
different objectives and it achieved all

00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:53,190
of them so the idea of the people oh the

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,869
noise for be undetectable is this is

00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:58,169
something we've looked at you yeah

00:31:54,869 --> 00:32:00,059
hopefully it works for you thank you did

00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:03,090
you find that the system learned to lean

00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:05,039
on one mechanism more so than others as

00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,889
it was learning the whole process of

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,400
what it could change to achieve its goal

00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:12,390
all right thank you very much Adam
