hello everyone i'm mark spencer my

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,240
background here actually in huntsville

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,720
was primarily in telecom before i did

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,960
got into airplane stuff but i'm here to

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,360
talk to you guys about what I call the

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,780
softening of wear so kind of moving up

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,239
from more Hardware oriented things to

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,870
more software oriented things and I'll

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,379
talk a little bit about telecom aviation

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,230
and how I see this potentially impacting

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:53,070
radio and how significant the role of

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:57,780
STR alright so I'll start out with just

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,820
kind of a brief history stuff so this is

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,030
really kind of the the focus of the talk

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,500
today is that over time the things that

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:12,120
a user experiences about technology has

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,150
shifted from the mechanical up towards

00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,060
more electrical oriented things up to

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,980
firmware up to software and eventually

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,530
up to configuration this is a trend

00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,630
you're kind of seeing across all of

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:30,810
technology and some sectors this has

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,470
moved more rapidly than others have so

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,090
in short

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,340
mechanical things tend to be get

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,310
replaced by electronics so if you think

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,950
about cars carburetors were a purely

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,320
mechanical device to be able to mix your

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,000
air and your fuel together and those got

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,770
replaced by electronic fuel injection

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,390
electronic components are attending to

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,490
be replaced with firmware so audio

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,800
mixers used to be sort of analog devices

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,790
and now they've kind of gotten to where

00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:03,360
they're more DSP now well built around

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,660
DSPs embedded processors that will do

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,090
that mixing for you firmware is tending

00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,519
to be replaced by software and probably

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,830
the most awful example I could think of

00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:18,959
as wind modems for those of you guys

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:21,780
that remember those days in software is

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,780
now being replaced by configuration like

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,900
if this than that

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,700
meaning that capabilities end users

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,830
the wetware right the softest of all

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,540
that is getting more and more able to be

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:39,390
able to interact with and manipulate

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:42,569
what the experience is so my first

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,959
experience in open-source was actually a

00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,549
project called game which was an instant

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,799
messenger on those themed byte here ever

00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:54,299
used game okay

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:57,810
so a few people so I back when I was in

00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,849
high school I wanted to figure out how

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,920
to write a graphical application for

00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,420
Linux and an instant messenger seemed

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,560
like a good application at the time and

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,040
that's kind of how I got started with

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,370
game and then from that kind of gave me

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,950
a taste for open source and then later

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,750
on being this kind of Linux guy that I

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,790
was everybody was kind of asking me for

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,250
help tech support I decided why don't I

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,019
try making a business out of that so I

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,140
had this tech support business and I

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,950
needed a phone system they were

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,709
definitely very expensive at the time

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:34,109
and at the time as a college student of

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,940
course the value of time was much less

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:38,280
than a value of money which led to the

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,200
concept that using this leftover

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,209
equipment I had from a co-op project I

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,720
could just figure out how to get a call

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,700
into the PC I made the features that I

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,170
needed and gave away the software as

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,420
open source and sometime after that

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,669
probably by a couple years realized that

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,829
that open source took me occations

00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,120
project asterisk was way more

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:02,370
interesting than the tech support

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,319
business and way more fun for me to work

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:09,680
on in the tech support business and

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:13,109
refocused around that so architectural e

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,450
asterisk essentially said I've got all

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:19,950
these different kinds of telephony

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,120
interfaces and they were kind of e at

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,940
that time there was this transition

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,800
between analog and voice over IP so you

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,800
can take all these different kind of

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:33,419
telephony services bring them in to this

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,520
kind of middle API and then the

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,979
developers application developers could

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,110
then write applications that could run

00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,950
across all of these different interfaces

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,440
and regardless

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:47,820
whether you're doing with an old round

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,620
ow analog phone or a you know modern

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,220
voice over IP phone all this capability

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,290
could be written once and you could kind

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,960
of plug into existing systems without

00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,170
having to completely replace an entire

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,430
phone system and at the time that was a

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,080
really dramatic breakthrough because

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,670
people were not really sure if voice

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,430
over IP was going to be a trend that was

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:13,380
going to take off or not so in the big

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,610
scheme of things this is all of course

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:21,030
in retrospect looking back

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:24,480
telecommunications started as a literal

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,310
mechanical plugging of things you know

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,680
here's one phone line being connected

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,810
physically to another - the idea of

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,910
using switches and circuits to do that

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:38,250
kind of more in an automated fashion and

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:40,200
then eventually to the idea of oh we

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,880
could use micro processors embedded

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,190
microprocessor to do this functionality

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,720
to the part where I came in which was in

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,250
the 2000s taking asterisk and making

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,030
this whole thing become a software

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,460
problem and then finally moving on to

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,800
where the configuration was what the

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,780
actual user interface for the customer

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,480
was so when you were interacting whether

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,050
you were mainly working on the

00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:12,120
configuration oh wow there's an airplane

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:14,430
so yeah airplanes most important thing

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,860
is that they are a lot more interesting

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,710
than phones are now this this isn't to

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,830
say the phones can't be fun I have to

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,570
tell you that it was extremely exciting

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,100
the first time I could actually connect

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,110
a phone to my computer and I made it

00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,580
ring and you'd pick it up and you could

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,260
hear dial tone and I would show my

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,880
friends and they would they would not

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,030
nearly share the same excitement that I

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,980
was but I will say that with airplanes

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:43,310
it's much easier to find people who

00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:46,500
share that excitement and an amazingly

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,990
airplane struggle today with the same

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,700
problems that I was dealing with around

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:54,289
phone systems in the early 2000s so this

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,020
is kind of

00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:59,389
a staggering statistic but particularly

00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:02,899
on the military side the cost of

00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:05,449
developing a new airplane is the vast

00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:08,749
majority of it is actually the software

00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:11,779
right I think that's to me that is just

00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:14,539
a mind-numbing ly hard number to get

00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:17,749
over the idea that the software is what

00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:21,229
drives the cost of of this development

00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:24,919
but anyway basically what happened is

00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:29,360
you know I I had this talk on business I

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:31,969
started getting big and I'm really kind

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,770
of more of a small company guy and as

00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:34,939
part of that I decided I was going to

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:39,080
learn how to fly I want to do something

00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:41,740
different and then discovered that hey

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,569
here's all the software in airplanes and

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,419
it's you know it has all these weird

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:49,729
challenges unique safety critical

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,139
requirements big you know it was very

00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,839
obvious that flying could be a lot

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:58,550
better if there was better software it

00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,800
was still being sold as hardware so if

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,319
you think about imagine yourself going

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,159
to Best Buy and saying hey I'm saying up

00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,300
a new office and they said ok we're

00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,159
gonna sell you this computer to be a

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,240
word processor and we have this other

00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,039
computer will sell you that's a

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,360
spreadsheet and here's this third

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,709
computer over here that can connect to

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,599
internet if you buy them all from the

00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:19,339
same company you might be able to wire

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,349
them together and get them to trade data

00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:23,389
between each other you know of course

00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:25,610
say that's ridiculous I just need a

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:27,949
computer that can run these different

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,930
applications and yet somehow in aviation

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:34,459
we have just accepted that that first

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:36,889
model is the way things work so it

00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:38,449
occurs to me that I've kind of had this

00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:39,979
story before and wouldn't it be fun to

00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:42,409
do another startup this is kind of like

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,660
I'm up if you guys have kids that have

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,550
moved out of the house so I don't have

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:51,110
any kids by was one one so I feel like I

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,730
can speak about this but it's sort of

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,560
like if you were a parent and your kids

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,910
moved out and in your head you sort of

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,560
thought wow wouldn't it be great to have

00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,000
a baby again you forget about like all

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,680
the work that was involved in those

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,420
early times that's kind of what happened

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,740
to me and this time a little bit

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,620
different I want to actually monetize

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,410
the software

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,800
software definitely different technical

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:16,070
challenges and certification challenges

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,050
but the architecture actually is very

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,279
similar to what goes on with asterisk so

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,250
there are few differences but for the

00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,690
most part you have physically how you

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,550
reach out to all these different devices

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:32,160
whether screens or radios or sensors

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,779
bring them all in and then these little

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,910
micro services that are built on those

00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,250
common API to be able to hook them

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,510
together details that are not really the

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,320
focus the presentation the important

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:46,980
part was avionics again same sort of

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,770
thing we had a physical instrumentation

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,830
that was based on on physical principles

00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,560
so like an airspeed indicator in a

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,660
traditional airspeed indicator is

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,810
literally a bra a form of a barometer

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,130
that is comparing the static pressure

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,350
they just sort of ambient outside

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,870
pressure and the ram air pressure

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,029
similarly an altimeter is literally just

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,920
a barometer and so most of those

00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:13,920
instruments don't even need electrical

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,200
power to be able to operate and then

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,150
from there there was move into

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,790
electrical electrically powered

00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,640
instruments and then from there too the

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,410
idea that you've got you know kind of

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,850
firmware they're they're specialized

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,220
software designed to run on a very

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,100
specific bit of hardware and what we're

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:37,410
trying to do is to essentially build

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:39,240
avionics as software to do just portable

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,980
code micro services that can implement

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,480
what appears to be a very integrated

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,630
experience but there's really all these

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,250
individual pieces and then eventually

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:49,140
moving into where the configuration is

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,040
what actually drives the majority of the

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:58,680
features of the aircraft so how does all

00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:01,529
this come back to radio well obviously

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,300
we don't know of any aircraft that use

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,760
wired data connections to get back to

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,610
the ground I think there maybe was a

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,430
missile at one point that had a fiber

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,140
optic cable right the toe that had a

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,190
fiber optic cable that came out the back

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:20,240
but we don't really do that with

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,240
airplanes yeah

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:28,120
so they're a bunch of applications

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,860
actually radio in the in airplanes so

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,420
there are communication related things

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:36,640
VHF UHF what's called CP DLC which is a

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,770
data link for communicating between the

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,470
pilot and the controller using kind of

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:44,290
like text messages there's addressing

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:47,430
reporting ACARS you guys may have heard

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:52,030
about this and in the the sort of lost

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:55,810
airplane of the one that was lost over

00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:59,290
the the Indian Ocean and satphones

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,270
there's data link products for being

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,680
able to get weather for imagery text

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,440
product so that you can know what the

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,170
weather is like at your destination and

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,320
to see what radar pictures look like for

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,750
storms along your way engine trend

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,400
monitoring so the ability particularly

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,530
on turbine airplanes to be able to

00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,080
monitor the condition of the engines and

00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:23,470
be able to detect trends if something is

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,090
starting to go wrong of course music TV

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:29,140
internet but you also have all your

00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:31,750
ground navigation so via wores and iOS

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,310
is there still widely used today as well

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,870
as the obsolete things like a

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,170
non-directional beacons at marker

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:41,430
beacons there are satellite navigation

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:46,570
obviously GPS and related functionality

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:51,220
Lausanne lpv that can provide pretty

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,990
incredible approaches that are very very

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,900
precise for getting you into airports

00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,750
and lows visibility conditions and many

00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,610
times being able to land them and then

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,700
deconfliction that is the detection of

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:07,570
other aircraft and being able to avoid

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:11,620
running into them if ATC drops the ball

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,360
and doesn't keep you separated so our

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,400
big change that we've done in evolution

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,670
is essentially to say here's all these

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,520
different computers and devices that in

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,800
a typical aircraft are all separate so

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,230
they all have you know maybe different

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,690
processors they all have different

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,850
software running but you have to have

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,710
all these specific computers and our

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,210
idea is you can put all those on sort of

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,700
and computers where you can just have

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,710
multiples of them for redundancy so you

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,900
don't have to worry about losing you

00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,640
know your autopilot computer or your ffs

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,950
computer because you can just have

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,300
redundancy in the actual computers and

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,580
the rest of it is just software that

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,500
doesn't weigh anything

00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,670
of course the big change that I'm

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,460
reaching out to you guys the r8

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,320
community about is that these radios

00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,510
still to this day even though they're

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,370
our system are all separate radios so

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,680
your transponder your comrade you have

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:07,150
radio even the things that are receive

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,910
only are separate kind of distinct

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,860
elements and new capability typically is

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,740
going to require the replacement of a

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:18,070
new radio or the addition of a new radio

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,170
to a system and it gets hard to to pull

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:24,460
that functionality in and make it more

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,960
widely available once you do start

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,810
getting all this data in the same place

00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,610
it becomes easier to start thinking

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,580
about applications that you can't do

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:36,760
with conventional equipment so for

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,350
example on the evolution side we can

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,690
because we have access to all the

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:45,990
aircraft data in our in our architecture

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:48,490
we can verify data that has different

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,770
discrete sources so things like the

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,660
angle of attack that you're flying with

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,810
the airplane which is how you detect

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,400
approach to stall has a physical

00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,930
relationship with the indicated airspeed

00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,940
the weight and the g-force on the

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,560
aircraft we have a place to be able to

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,700
see all that and to be able to improve

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,350
the quality of the data

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:09,490
similarly on radio if you're doing SDR

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,460
you might have the ability for example

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:15,160
to monitor an emergency frequency and

00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,790
have that available even while you're

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,190
tuned to another frequency for your main

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,230
communication those things don't

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,520
essentially don't exist and hardware

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,990
ones right now but the opportunity is

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,850
there to be able to do all that not to

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,920
mention the idea that you could have

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,960
navigation and communication could be on

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,060
the same physical radio and you could in

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,950
software switch the functionality so

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,680
that maybe you only have to have three

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,480
radios that can provide you all your

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:46,770
functions with an appropriate level of

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,770
redundancy so in summary

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:54,930
Tech gets softer over time iterative

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,910
innovation gets faster and cheaper so

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,709
that is that is something that largely

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,509
does not exist in aviation right now

00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:03,180
iterative innovation that's something

00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:06,839
we're trying to drive our planes are

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:09,690
really cool tech in aviation has lagged

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,660
the rest of our lives we certainly think

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,029
that there are many opportunities to

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,500
take relatively simple technology I mean

00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:18,600
when we describe how our stuff works

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,310
most of you probably think why is that

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,690
not how it's already done all right

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,550
there are many opportunities to take

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,370
tech that has existed in lots of other

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:30,060
sectors and make a big difference in how

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:32,069
it works so please help leverage the

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,690
promise of SDR to improve the safety and

00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:37,440
to make aviation more economical and

00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,800
also we're looking for software

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,399
developers if you guys know any or are

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,959
interested and I guess that's it and I'm

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,630
gonna reserve the rest of time for any

00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:51,019
questions that you guys might have

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,019
pretty much mark

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,780
okay do we have any questions okay he

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,610
thinks a very interesting presentation

00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,460
one of the one of the challenges must be

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:05,589
the the very very heavy international

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,930
regulation you know in terms of avionics

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,550
and avionics and airframes and all that

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,350
sort of stuff and I mean that would that

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,970
would seem to be you know myself I'm a

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,930
pilot that is the biggest it's the

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:18,220
biggest burden right getting you know

00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,810
you can develop stuff but trying to get

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,790
it implemented you have this huge

00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:26,290
regulatory mountain that you have to

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:29,050
work with okay so that is a great

00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:31,540
question and you you're absolutely right

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:35,470
and that the certification is the

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:38,800
primary driver of the cost of these

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:41,080
systems and so in developing our

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,980
software our focus has have been on two

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,050
elements one is you reduce the number of

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,200
requirements and prioritize that because

00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:52,600
essentially RAM CPU memory all that

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,350
stuff is virtually free compared to the

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,690
cost of the certification the second

00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:01,090
element is that we drive more of the

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,800
capability into configuration which

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,530
means that we don't have to reopen that

00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,950
software certification as often to be

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:11,590
able to make changes to the aircraft and

00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,680
to improve requirements now even against

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:17,560
that backdrop on the civilian side

00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,600
through the FAA around what are called

00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:24,820
part 23 airplanes so these are basically

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,610
19 passenger and smaller aircraft the

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,290
rules have changed now to be less

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,900
prescriptive about how you have to show

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,910
compliance with the rules and now our

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,000
performance base that you have to

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,890
demonstrate that you can meet the

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,690
specific performance requirement but

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,300
they're not describing how you have to

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,220
be able to do it and specifically on the

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,400
software side there's this thing called

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,440
do 178 that is kind of the big burden

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,290
that you have to carry around software

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,510
cert which is essentially a very

00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,430
complicated and expensive way to show

00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,929
that your software implements the

00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:03,550
requirements that you set forth is

00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:05,020
there's an appetite for alternatives to

00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,299
that for how you can demonstrate

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,629
software safety other than Jeff

00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:13,419
through deal 178 on the FAA side so in

00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:16,720
that sense there are avenues for

00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:19,360
certification for new avionics that are

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,690
much less onerous on the civilian side

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,489
at least on the army side that's or on

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,679
the military side that's a completely

00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:28,809
different picture and it's not clear to

00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,879
me yet if there's going to be an

00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:34,029
appetite for it and so we have to kind

00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:35,559
of prepare for deal 178 anyway but there

00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:37,389
are there are avenues that you can be

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,549
able to get to that are being approved

00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:42,210
without the traditional certification

00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:55,450
process using other methods of showing

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:57,759
software safety first of all thanks for

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,960
the presentation I think that mixing

00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,419
aviation and software is very

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,239
interesting and important one of the

00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:07,389
things that is a concerning factor about

00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:08,529
merging radios into one box is that with

00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,389
a current system with a whole bunch of

00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:12,519
different radio boxes you can swap out

00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:13,960
one do a software update to it have that

00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,119
certified and you're all good if you

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,769
merge them all into one box how would

00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,539
you convince the FAA that the

00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:21,249
configuration change on the VHF radio

00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:23,289
wouldn't influence any of the other

00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:27,580
antennas because these guys don't write

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:30,759
radios for a living right okay so this

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:33,159
is a problem that to some degree we

00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:36,070
cross anyway because we obviously run

00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,889
lots of applications on a common see CPU

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:41,559
there is an airing standard called 653

00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:43,720
for partitioning that essentially hard

00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,909
partitions processors where everybody

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,980
gets a known time slot a known amount of

00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:50,970
memory and these processors are

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:54,789
completely isolated from one another so

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:57,970
in that context a software-defined radio

00:20:54,789 --> 00:21:00,609
could have multiple essentially time

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,169
slots on the processor that's running it

00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:05,529
to be able to run different processes

00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:08,379
and you might not necessarily run the

00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:12,100
same process at the same time in other

00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:13,899
words you might say for example I want

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:18,369
to have three radios that can function

00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:20,950
either as comm or as nav or as let's say

00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:22,900
a DSB weather receiver

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,520
and I may not necessarily need to have

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:28,090
all three of those functions at the same

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:31,510
time or I might say I'm you know in the

00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:33,790
event that one of them fails I get away

00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,640
with just two of them and give up that

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,530
third element of functionality for the

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,200
duration of a flight because it's not as

00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,670
safety critical those are the kinds of

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,780
things you might be thinking about they

00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,140
don't all necessarily have to be the

00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:49,210
same way and I'll also say that I'm

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,450
thinking about SDR probably more on the

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,400
received side then on the transmit side

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,110
because I know there are limitations on

00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:02,230
how flexible you can be on the

00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:04,750
transmission side hey thanks for your

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,610
presentation um I have one question well

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:11,080
two actually one is related to safety

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:13,270
like how are you considering or how are

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,150
you making the mechanism the software

00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,920
safe - like malicious attacks through I

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,160
mean now it's if it says the art of it's

00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,150
all in one box or in one software it

00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:27,730
could be prone to like hacking or

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:30,670
something right it's critical that

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:34,630
safety is so that that is also a really

00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:37,750
good question there are lots of buses on

00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,880
a typical aircraft so on a conventional

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,700
aircraft if you have physical access to

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,920
the avionics buses there there was

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:50,350
certainly no security to keep you from

00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:53,260
injecting improper data onto the bus the

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:56,830
architecture that we have chosen gives

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:59,320
us the ability to reduce the attack

00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,760
vectors by using Ethernet as a common

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,480
bus and of course you can protect

00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,220
Ethernet with kind of standard security

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,500
methods on Ethernet that stuff's very

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,780
well understood and for the data that

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,110
necessarily comes in from legacy devices

00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:17,350
using other buses again we've got this

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:20,520
sort of place where you can compare data

00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,450
from different types of sensors that are

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,790
connected to you know radically

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,260
different systems in the aircraft where

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,990
there should be physical relationships

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:32,410
to be able to kick out bad data and that

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:35,049
is something that is very new and it's

00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,450
it's really intended primarily to

00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:40,470
avoid the possibility of a sensor

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:45,909
failure causing or more catastrophic

00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:47,830
accident but it also can be used to help

00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:51,249
remove a compromised

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:53,529
sensor or system of sensors from the mix

00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:55,239
of what the aircraft is considering okay

00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:58,509
just non question real quick so you

00:23:55,239 --> 00:24:01,119
mentioned software redundancy for safety

00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:05,230
but are you also considering Hardware

00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:08,350
redundancy Hardware Hardware yes what if

00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:10,539
the Box fails I don't know the RAM is no

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:14,529
longer functional yeah of course you can

00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:17,259
have multiple computers in this scenario

00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:19,299
they could be dissimilar computers and

00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:21,399
they could run to similar operating

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:22,659
systems so there are other ways you know

00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:25,629
there are other elements that you can

00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:29,590
use again to help protect the system

00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:33,159
through redundancy but a big piece of

00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:36,399
this is the idea that you should if you

00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,730
reduce the overall types of computers

00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:41,379
that you have to have then now you can

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,029
sort of decouple the software and the

00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,590
hardware elements and you can upgrade

00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:47,739
the computers as you need to upgrade the

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,480
computers separately from the software

00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:57,090
experience the pilot training experience

00:24:49,480 --> 00:25:00,279
and so on do you have any white papers

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:06,279
describing your security protocols and

00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:07,690
your approach the we have we have a

00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:11,080
little bit of limited information about

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:15,879
how we are protecting the configuration

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:18,879
through encryption and signatures at the

00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:20,859
data transmission level that is just

00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:24,549
Ethernet so we're just right on top of

00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:27,220
you know IP e DP e packets right so you

00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,929
would use the same techniques to protect

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,239
the Ethernet that you would otherwise do

00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:33,460
that right now is kind of outside the

00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:35,169
scope of what we're concerned with

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,929
because that is a very well-established

00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:42,129
problem of how you protect IP TP we

00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:44,259
factors have the same sort of problem

00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:46,860
with SCADA skate as a control that was

00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:49,350
never designed for any kind of security

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,690
so now they're connecting them so I see

00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,880
a parallel between what you're trying to

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:58,860
do and what I've got to go do to okay so

00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:04,620
anyway um thank you sure either yep

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:06,390
Mart's at markers sofa throw things for

00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,340
game because your high school nerdery

00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,590
enabled my high school social life that

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,799
that was cool

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:17,370
[Laughter]

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:19,289
also remark on that it seems like you're

00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:23,460
doing something very similar to what the

00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:25,679
EE teams in car system manufacturers are

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,539
doing right they're doing easy use that

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,269
kind of centralized a lot of functions

00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:33,570
kind of merge a lot of different legacy

00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:35,730
buses have Ethernet interfaces have

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,950
other kinds of interfaces even it might

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:41,279
not be the choice for some some kind of

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,860
communications but I'm mostly concerned

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,169
with is you're trying like you're

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,409
drawing a con the alliance between

00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:50,730
configuration and software right you say

00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:54,330
configuration is cool because it doesn't

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:55,980
have to be recertified it's just you

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,840
know you you say it's something

00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,500
different and I'm not quite sure where

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,029
to draw that line sure it's it is not

00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,399
that you don't have to certify the

00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:07,289
changes to the configuration but the

00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:09,929
methodology is different the

00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:15,200
configuration is about the safety

00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:18,090
analysis and saying you know I'm I'm

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,269
changing what the requirements are and I

00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:24,029
want to demonstrate that this new set of

00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:28,049
requirements is safer than the old set

00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:30,269
of requirements okay but then the second

00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:33,090
piece is if you have to change the

00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:36,570
software you now have to reopen this

00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:38,880
whole question of demonstrating that

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,580
your software implements the

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,490
requirements that you spelled out

00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,529
whereas through configuration we can

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,149
change the requirements because we have

00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:50,460
already certified that the software

00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:52,440
meets the requirements of how to

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,679
interpret the configuration and now you

00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,110
can just produce the configuration so

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,480
another example is there are tools that

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:03,359
exist in which you can

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,850
lay out essentially model a system and

00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,669
the tool itself has gone through the

00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:13,769
configure the certification to show that

00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:15,600
the output of the tool implements the

00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:18,359
requirements of what you put into the

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,619
model and so that generated code does

00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:22,529
not have to go through certification

00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:24,419
it's considered passed already because

00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:25,830
the tool itself has been certified to be

00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,799
able to produce that code so the

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:39,499
configuration is kind of a variation on

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:44,039
that model okay I have one related to

00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:45,330
asterisk have you ever run actually show

00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:48,899
of hands in the audience from the four

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:53,220
who has run open BTS with asterisk

00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:55,169
attached to it did you ever run open BTS

00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,379
with asterisk asterisk attached to it I

00:28:55,169 --> 00:29:01,049
did not run open BTS I thought it was

00:28:58,379 --> 00:29:03,509
really cool do not have the radio

00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:05,970
background that especially then did not

00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:09,720
have any radio background no I have you

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:13,549
know went from this to this it it never

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,299
gets much more than that yeah alright

00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:24,809
are any other questions in the audience

00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:26,999
Oh sometime so I'm guessing you're

00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:30,869
planning to have your source open is

00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:33,269
that true it is source available but

00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:35,399
what we want to do is to license the

00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:38,309
source code of what we have produced to

00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,960
an OEM that can include it that can use

00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:44,519
it in their aircraft so they would be

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,840
able to update it it is not it is not

00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,039
open source in the sense that we would

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,679
give away the source code on the

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,659
internet just widely for anybody to use

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,330
but its intended that what we are

00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,859
licensing is source code for vendors to

00:29:54,330 --> 00:30:00,149
be able to make changes so that you're

00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:01,559
not locked in to a specific avionics

00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:03,840
company in the same way that you are

00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,749
today so sort of really where I was

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,080
going was that is do you anticipate any

00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:12,899
change in attitude from the regulatory

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,550
bodies from having more people looking

00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:19,240
at this

00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:21,520
the visibility actually it's funny that

00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,750
you say that because for you and me we

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,220
recognize that having more people

00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,730
looking at the source code improves the

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:29,500
safety and from the perspective of the

00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,530
FAA they're much more concerned about

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:36,340
demonstrating configuration management

00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:41,230
that there can't be a change to the code

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:44,950
that is not somehow reflected or track

00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:46,690
they're more worried about the idea well

00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,810
as an example when we talked to them

00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,880
about using Linux for avionics that

00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:54,520
would go beyond the certain level of

00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,300
safety requirement their biggest concern

00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,160
with Linux was being able to show that

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:05,200
that someone could not put a modified

00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:07,090
version of Linux on the device and not

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,300
have that be that information be

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:12,160
available to the pilot so it actually

00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,200
tracks almost inversely from the way you

00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,870
would you would think that it would in a

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,800
regulatory body but again under the new

00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:22,990
rules it's sort of back in our court to

00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,450
be able to demonstrate the importance of

00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:32,490
that the importance of the access to the

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:34,570
code any other questions for mark no

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,990
just couple minutes early all right

00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:41,519
thank you so much mark

00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:41,519
