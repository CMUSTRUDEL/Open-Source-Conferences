Description: 
	UAS Community Testbed Architecture for Advanced Wireless Research with Open-Source SDRs by Vuk Marojevic, Ismail Guvenc, Rudra Dutta, Mihail Sichitiu

Enabling ubiquitous mobility and connectivity unleashes new applications and capabilities that will allow new technologies such as driverless cars, virtual and augmented reality, and massive Internet of things become reality. Major new use cases for advanced wireless technologies, once thought to be science fiction, are emerging in the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) spaces with opportunities in commercial, civil, government, and military sectors. While researchers have been analyzing and proposing a variety of new use cases for UAS, only a fraction of those are supported by experiments and service demonstrations, mostly in isolated setups. The safe integration of UAS into the national airspace requires more data and experiences using advanced wireless technologies with and without humans in the loop. We address this problem by envisioning and architecting a conceptual facility that we call aerial experimentation and research platform for advanced wireless, or AERPAW. AERPAW provides a blueprint for designing and operating a community research testbed that combines commercial wireless networking technologies with open-source software radios in production-like 3D mobility environments. We discuss the requirements, deployment challenges and solution alternatives, and the important role of the open-source SDR community for building and maintaining a wireless testbed in which mobile vehicles, in particular unmanned aerial vehicles, are the first-class citizens.

yeah my name is Luke Maravich I am at

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,310
Mississippi State University I'm

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,200
associate professor and my research is

00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,520
in software radios cognitive radios

00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,490
regular communications also wireless

00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,250
test beds and testing and wireless

00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:36,570
wireless security today I'm going to

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:39,370
present our new platform called air puff

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,020
air puff stands for aerial

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,630
experimentation and research platform

00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,970
for advanced wireless okay and this is a

00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,840
collaborative project between

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,239
Mississippi State University and other

00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,600
academics and companies I'll talk about

00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:55,839
this in a minute so I meant aerial

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,559
system or US or I use UAV as well I mean

00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:01,570
aerial vehicles as synonymous or drones

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,770
we all probably know that Amazon wanted

00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,360
to fly to use drones to deliver packages

00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,880
other companies have done this large

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,200
packets are being delivered door-to-door

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,909
or in rural areas on Africa or wherever

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,799
food delivery is now very popular but

00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:23,649
also medical delivery including like

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,630
blood or vaccines and things like that

00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:29,979
from one hospital to another there have

00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:32,560
been some experiments using drones ok so

00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:35,290
then of course NASA is looking into

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,259
unmanned aerial vehicles for some future

00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:43,469
applications like aerial taxis as well

00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:45,820
as uber and Boeing and others what a

00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:48,159
telecom companies like AT&T and others

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,049
are using drones sometimes to enhance

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,210
their capacity right or to deploy base

00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:54,990
stations when where there are no cell

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:59,229
coverage for instance after disaster

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,850
also if you have interference you don't

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:03,180
you're you're tracking interference

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:07,420
source movies can be very helpful to

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,340
localize interfere and of course there's

00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,520
also the notion of security and safety

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,710
right UAVs once they start flying they

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,930
can be a safety hazard right the

00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:21,190
airports are afraid of UAVs interfering

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:23,110
with airplanes well yesterday was a good

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,050
time and good day for us because NSF

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,180
announced air park as a third power

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,689
platform to be developed

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,950
and power is stands for platforms for

00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:38,159
advanced wireless research

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:41,680
it's a NSF industry consortium agreement

00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,739
to support the development of four big

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,750
large-scale test beds in the US let's

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:49,390
cover part of the city and then allow

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,560
experimentation and research for global

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:58,390
researchers and for industry so what you

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,799
see here is is North Carolina is around

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,079
North Carolina State University in

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:04,569
Rayleigh so they're leading this effort

00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,609
you see three base stations that we want

00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,500
to deploy by the end of next May end of

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:10,930
summer so within one year well the

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,639
project has started yesterday and within

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,579
one year we'll have three towers and

00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,109
three drones okay and if you're going to

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,609
set them demos during a summer school

00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:21,970
and so forth and then we'll have you

00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:23,859
guys use it and help us develop it and

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,340
make you do your experiments in a

00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:29,709
real-life environment with with drones

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,569
so of course you see a gap after year

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,930
three we will have fifteen maybe twenty

00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:37,900
base stations that close this gap and

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,870
this is about four four or five miles

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,760
maybe that will have a range of doing

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,889
drone experiments along four or five

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,269
miles of cellular connectivity and when

00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:50,230
I say cellular connectivity it's an

00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:51,519
experimental cellular network okay and

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,290
of course there are lots of issues like

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,699
the highway we need to cross and things

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,109
like that I'm going to talk a little bit

00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:59,409
about that but things are going to be

00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:02,019
resolved so this was the motivation now

00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:04,359
let me briefly give you the outline of

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,209
my talk so first of all I need to

00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:10,900
present a team it's a big team that's

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:13,239
behind this and our objective and then I

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,549
will most mostly focus on the airport

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,919
radios that we plan to deploy software

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:19,840
radios and other radios and then some

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,440
experimental flow how an experimenter

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,840
would use air power like you or industry

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,789
or academics or others and finally some

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,830
research examples why we built this we

00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:32,229
built this to enable research and

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,139
education and standardization all those

00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:38,409
things okay our mission is to serve as a

00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:41,319
unique technology labeler for research

00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:45,549
and advanced Wireless with

00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:49,329
okay so we want to use these 3d mobile

00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:50,739
systems the drones did enhance with

00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:53,589
enhanced mobility right and three

00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:55,629
dimensions and use it buy and use an

00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:57,699
advanced wireless technology to enable

00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,889
the integration of drones into the

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,869
airspace and and have save operations of

00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:03,610
off drones and have good wireless

00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:06,159
connectivity okay

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,279
NC State is leading this Mississippi

00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:11,110
State is the second academic partner

00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,179
then we also partnered with University

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,819
of South Carolina and Purdue and we have

00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:20,439
two one Research Center and a software

00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:23,369
company renze so this is a team of PI's

00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:26,439
of principal investigators Ismail and I

00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:31,509
we have similar background we know about

00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:32,949
sdrs 14 5g and standards I've been

00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,800
developing test beds I used to be a

00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:39,129
Virginia Tech and I managed a coronet

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,610
testbed the USRP based testbed so then

00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:44,379
we have a Rudra who is a networking

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,649
specialist an IT specialist maybe a

00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:48,789
Michael who is a drone specialists we

00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:50,679
have Brian Floyd who is a

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:52,239
millimeter-wave circuit specialist so

00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:55,089
he's building integrated circuits for

00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:56,919
millimeter-wave communications and we

00:05:55,089 --> 00:06:00,939
have two people Tom and Robert they're

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:02,949
FAA regulation experts how to talk to FA

00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,429
to get special permits for flying as

00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:06,309
needed

00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:09,939
and we have Gerard who is a virus

00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:12,729
testing guy so we are the principal

00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:15,849
investigators most of us except these

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:17,860
two our professors and then we have

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:21,399
partners a lot of partners from industry

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,429
telecom industry of course but also like

00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:28,419
cable companies or fiber optic companies

00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:30,429
and so forth and by the way there as I

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:33,879
said the power program is financed by

00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:35,919
industry and NSF so industry is donating

00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,759
their latest wireless technology or

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,589
fiber or access to towers and NSF is

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,219
donating money in order to pay for the

00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:49,509
researchers and for the deployment ok so

00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:51,159
this all fits very neatly into 5g we

00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:53,619
believe because one of the things that

00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,400
5g will will enable is better

00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:57,400
connectivity

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,830
in Vidor connectivity for lots of new

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:06,610
verticals and one of them division will

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:08,979
be drones or UAVs so one specific

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,900
aspects of unities is they need to be

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,539
nowadays really controlled they need to

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,699
be fly there needs to be an operator who

00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:19,330
operates in UAV and needs to be within

00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:21,520
visual line of sight of the UAV ok so we

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,530
are now here manual control and visual

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,650
line of sight we're moving towards

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:30,940
operation that's autonomous without

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:32,919
using a radio controller right but then

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,960
in order to be able to do belong beyond

00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,630
line of sight operations so without

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,120
visual observers we believe that this

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,880
only solution is using and testing and

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,860
advancing wireless technology this is

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,660
why one of the reasons we are we're

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,949
building this testbed in order to get

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:54,490
real experience in a real environment

00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:57,160
ok so lots of options for UAV research

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,410
and connect and related to wireless

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:03,460
communications I mentioned the hotspots

00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:05,440
when you need extra capacity smart

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,080
agriculture is a nice one rural areas

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,550
that are not connected right yeah our UT

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,650
devices that you can deploy in those

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,780
fields to measure the soil or the

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,210
moisture or whatever in order to to

00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,010
initiate some actions so you can have

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,130
drones to collect the data we're flying

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:24,580
over the field also of course usually

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:26,830
swarm operations UAVs that operate in

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,960
concert to fulfill some mission we need

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:36,039
to have some at home at least ad hoc

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:38,169
networking capabilities ok so now I want

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,800
to explain what kind of radios we plan

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:44,200
to deploy for our platform so the

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,910
objective here is to provide the users

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,200
the global researchers developers

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,640
educators regulators etc anyone can use

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,540
the platform it's a community testbed

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:59,589
with a wide set of radio options and a

00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:01,660
wide set of radio environments ok to be

00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:04,750
able at say rural environments or urban

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,430
environments and so forth but let's talk

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,240
about the radios so here's the list of

00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,670
radios that bein

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,339
vision of course our principal radius

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,790
will be as DRS we already received a

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:18,339
bunch of sdrs from ni we using we will

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,529
use mostly x3 ten and two ten and maybe

00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:22,720
millimeter wave as DRS for both the

00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:25,300
towers and for them mobile note some

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,110
lighter versions of them then another

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,610
big provider is Ericsson we hope to

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,000
collaborate with Ericsson very tightly

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,300
and get there 5g equipment for the radio

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,950
and later for the core network as well

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,250
and then we will have a bunch of our

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,440
sensors to sense the spectrum IOT is a

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:48,430
big topic especially for rural

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:52,000
development and research radars

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:55,330
important everybody's I mean regulators

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,810
and are afraid of UAVs not behaving

00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,390
right

00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:00,070
we're not reporting themselves so you

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,220
can use radar so tech those you release

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:05,910
and then for research again localization

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,570
is a big topic we can use ultra wideband

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:12,220
transceivers for that and eventually

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,779
after we're done in the first phase if

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,760
you have a special radio do you want to

00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,610
test in real environment you can bring

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,380
your radio to our test beds and we can

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,800
we need to arrange how to integrate and

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:27,910
how to allow surfed set safe operations

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:31,270
but this is definitely supported okay

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,579
there as the ARS the regulars bx3 tents

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,160
with daughter boards wideband oral

00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:38,380
boards then entry tents we're excited of

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,420
using those as well and they're

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,610
expecting an eye to launch their

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:47,470
affordable millimeter wave as the ours

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,850
possibly and this will be deployed on

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,899
the towers because they're heavy and

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,700
power consuming as the ours and then for

00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,550
for the mobile term for the mobile node

00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,950
such as UAVs we will use the b-series

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,529
mostly because of the lighter form

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,810
factor and most of these as the ARS need

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,700
a computer so you have to get some good

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:10,810
computers for the towers and also for

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,640
the UAVs okay while there is no

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,950
affordable solution for millimeter wave

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,020
software radios we are going to build

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:20,020
our own as they are millimeter wave

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,940
extenders so we have a professor in our

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,400
team

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,920
Professor Brian Floyd she's grants

00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,610
estate he is a specialist in

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,490
millimeter-wave

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:33,030
icy design so he has some prototypes

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:36,540
already to develop a very tight packaged

00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:39,060
antenna race for millimeter wave beam

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,250
forming so he builds these custom

00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,160
antenna arrays uses a commercial beam

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,690
forming chip and then depending if if

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,180
the millimeter wave as the arts are

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,300
available we can use the set up directly

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,460
if not we can use and build our own up

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,960
and down conversion stages to use though

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,250
as the arts are available today if you

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,840
have any questions about millimeter wave

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:07,040
you feel free also to contact Brian so

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,300
so here's my specialty it's software so

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,830
this off the hardware is great but

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,400
software radios need also software to

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,710
operate so I'm very interested in using

00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,250
and leveraging this community of working

00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:23,100
with you guys on and my students already

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,830
do that they use new radio for learning

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,290
about software radios and developing

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,630
some waveforms for initial testing or

00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,070
for testing and the platform eventually

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,220
we are going to provide the testbed

00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:37,980
hardware and software or package the

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,110
software in some way that it's usable

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,730
for you for different types of users

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,400
there are novice users right there are

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,010
expert users so maybe may develop a GUI

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,230
graphical user interface that helps you

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,570
configure an LT base station for

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,570
instance easily without much knowledge

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:57,810
about LT so therefore we're going to

00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,550
leverage SRS LTE we are working with

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,690
them they're one of the partners they

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,910
have 5g available and they saw 40

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,590
available and 5g no future they're also

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,950
looking at regular to everything

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,530
communications and open air interface is

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,810
also has lots of tools for 40 and 5g

00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,460
networking remember we're trying to

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,050
build an advanced wireless test but we

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,660
want to go very wide band and use

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:24,330
advanced wireless protocols to maybe

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,490
integrate to be able to operate with the

00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,530
commercial base stations the 5g base

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,690
stations of 4G base stations to be able

00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,940
to interoperate with them and allow more

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:36,260
experiments you can develop your own

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,260
protocols and waveforms

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,660
or we can develop some other waveforms

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,990
let's say jamming waveforms and and give

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,540
them to you for for your experiments and

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,770
to support research and standardization

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,360
so here's some other radios I just

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:57,230
briefly want to touch upon so one is the

00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:03,060
keysight RF sensor so those can be used

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:04,410
for localizing drones keysight is one of

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,410
the partners they will supply those

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,089
radios no sensor sorry and then they

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,470
have a hand hole handheld device that

00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:17,240
can be used in order to monitor your 4G

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,560
or 5g network coverage and and

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,839
performance

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,620
so I mentioned IOT the we will use SiC

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,839
Fox IOT and maybe Laura so here we have

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,480
some sick Fox sensors that we plan to

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,779
deploy in agricultural fields we have a

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,089
field test side and then we can have

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:39,360
either a six six box space station on a

00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:42,899
drone to collect that data or be

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,760
supplied from a base station tower so

00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,670
this is just a capability then then also

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:51,300
we have four time radars which have been

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:54,510
designed to detect drones unauthorized

00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:56,610
drones so they're also very several

00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:01,649
companies are interested in that kind of

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:03,839
research and development and then for

00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:05,850
localization I mentioned we have ultra

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,910
wideband transceivers and we also plan

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:16,500
to use you Wi-Fi sniffers to localize

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:18,570
ground users for instance okay so enough

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,220
about radios let me now explain how our

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,480
nodes will look like just a high-level

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,640
architecture okay

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,520
so we will have towers and we will have

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,800
mobile nodes on the towers which can be

00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,950
actual towers that can be rooftops we

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,070
plan to have to offer the user radios

00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:38,459
and a workstation a computer with

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:41,220
virtual machines where he or she can

00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:43,140
develop software radio programs and then

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,640
you'll have all sorts of cabling to the

00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,620
end to the top of the tower with

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,070
different types of antennas we may have

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,930
antenna arrays

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,940
there's a company in Santa Clara Blue

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,220
Danube they're also one of our

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,579
collaborators they have antenna raisins

00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:01,300
and beamforming algorithms to extend or

00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:03,519
improve the cellular coverage then also

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,930
RF monitors are important to monitor the

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,990
spectrum on tour what the user is doing

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,000
if he's behaving because we need

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,880
licenses of course and we plan to get

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,699
licenses from FCC to be able to operate

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,470
our wireless testbed outdoors but we to

00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:19,649
control what the user is actually doing

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,649
right

00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:27,069
moreover sorry that was at our site now

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:31,930
let's look at the mobile nodes so the

00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:36,970
mobile nodes is a vehicle and the radio

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:39,370
and in terms of UAV language or we call

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,889
the radio the payload so the radio

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,829
payload will again be different types of

00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:46,360
radios maybe it'll be 5g handset

00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:49,480
smartphone or it might be in as they are

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,100
right and there may and and there will

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,680
be different then options as I mentioned

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,860
those small antenna patch antennas for

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,990
millimeter wave beamforming those who

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,079
plan to build for the UAVs because

00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,120
they're very compact and and light and

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,270
then there is also the autopilot and

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:10,510
there are the inter interfaces with the

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:12,780
RC receiver so the autopilot will be in

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,669
the hands of the operators which is us

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,030
but the radios will be programmable by

00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:21,640
the users which is you and then we have

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,470
two links so cellular links so one

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,189
cellular link again will be experimental

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:30,070
link that you can use and the other one

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:33,870
will be for us to control the UAV maybe

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:37,600
or two to start and stop the experiment

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:40,900
so you have a link that you can develop

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,940
your own I don't knows let's say we

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,010
offer you 15 base stations and you

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,140
select five of them for your experiment

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,240
so those five base stations will be kind

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,190
of part of your experiment right but we

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,010
may use other cellular networks and

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,380
services around it to control a UAV and

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,390
be able to abort you know start the

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,620
experiment and so forth okay as a

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,620
control link

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:09,159
and then we have the mobile vehicles we

00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,140
have UAVs as I mentioned we will use

00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,260
mostly multicopters so we're planning

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:20,830
between 10 and 20 maybe multicopters

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:24,789
that can we can carry a weight of 10 to

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:27,610
15 pounds or more but the heavier the

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:30,159
fewer the range or battery range right

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:32,649
and there are regulations right you

00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:35,260
cannot without permission fly above 400

00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:37,960
feet and I think you cannot carry higher

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,179
payloads and 25 pounds without extra

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,970
provisions then we may use also some

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:46,480
fixed thing aircrafts we also have hella

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:49,029
carts which can hover very high altitude

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,830
or medium altitudes or even lower

00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:53,320
altitudes and they can over 4 months

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:56,169
so there we can potentially set up a

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,919
aerial base station to cover the area or

00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:02,049
do experiments with that and so we were

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,260
also suggested and to use ground

00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:07,840
vehicles like Rovers or golf carts or

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:11,440
buses to extend our experimentation

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:15,159
capabilities beyond just aerial ok so

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,870
how do you use air power well we need to

00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:19,360
ensure that everything that's developed

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,730
for experimentation satisfies your needs

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,640
but it's also apt for actually flying

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:27,299
out outdoors and doing outdoor

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,620
experiments therefore we offer you a

00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,240
development framework where you can

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,270
develop your experiments you can develop

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,760
your radios if you want and with virtual

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:39,600
machines and you can you can develop

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,220
define what types of what part of them

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,830
what bit resources out of a testbed

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,990
you want to use for experiment once you

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,360
have done that you go through the

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:52,720
sandbox and sandbox is a safe

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,240
environment which uses the hardware the

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,279
software in hardware that you want to

00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,279
use for experiment but it's not outdoors

00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,140
it's in a room you don't fly it drones

00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,720
that drones don't fly you just they

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,630
don't have propellers and you don't

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,720
radiate necessarily once this passes a

00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:13,090
test or is compliant with our regulation

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,960
of what you wanted to do then you go

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,480
through them only

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,690
stage so here they emulate and software

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,000
lots of things emulate the UAV flight we

00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,500
emulate the channel and so forth one of

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,309
the big test better does this is

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Coliseum right from DARPA so DARPA will

00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,500
hand over Coliseum to NSF as well and

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,390
will be also and under this power

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,909
project right so we may actually end up

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,820
using Coliseum for for doing emulation

00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:41,799
and finally when everything is past the

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,960
checks and you're satisfied with your

00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,299
experiment you submit your request for

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,149
actually doing the experiment and that's

00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:52,029
when you as the user start interacting

00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:53,500
with us as the operator that's when we

00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:56,020
take over and we schedule your

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,730
experiment and we run your experiment

00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,260
nowadays we need to have visual

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,029
observers as I mentioned so if you have

00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,730
five years in your experiment we need to

00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:05,559
have set up five pilots there that

00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:09,220
observe each pile observing one UAV

00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:10,750
that's how the thing stands now and you

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,399
get the results you observe what's going

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,330
on in your experiment and you retrieve

00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:19,000
your result and that's it in terms of

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,590
cost it's easy and you get a lot of

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,770
resources to do all those things but

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,179
once you actually use the testbed it

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,399
might become crowded because of other

00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:28,779
tests test productivity is going on so

00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:31,990
we're not trying absolutely trying to

00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:33,940
run fifteen experiments in parallel our

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,980
approach our vision is to have this

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,529
large-scale capability where

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,020
experimenters can use a wide field of

00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:45,370
radios and wide field of area right to

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,750
run an experiment and in order to use

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,600
the testbed eventually there will be

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,730
some sort of token system because as I

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,010
mentioned NSF sponsors it so the NSF

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,529
wants NSF researchers to use part of a

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,870
testbed Industry sponsoring the radio

00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:02,110
equipment mostly they will get also

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:04,779
usage time on the testbed and then the

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:09,010
rest is for general users researchers

00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:11,020
other companies and so forth and the

00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,070
cost structure is not yet defined but as

00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,899
you can imagine we need to be

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,120
sustainable after the project is over

00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:18,450
project runs for five years they need to

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,880
be sustainable to run the testbed beyond

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:24,940
okay let me conclude with a few research

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,080
examples that we found interesting in

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,299
order or

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,299
for us to decide to build such a testbed

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:32,649
so one is with SRS LTE we set up a base

00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:35,500
station on the ground somewhere in the

00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:41,529
field open field and this is a real

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:45,100
experiment and we flew an SRS ue which

00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:49,779
is like a 4G LTE UE we mounted it on on

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:52,269
a small quadcopter drone and software

00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:54,399
radio for metals and we flew it and we

00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:59,409
measured the received signal strength so

00:22:54,399 --> 00:23:01,480
interestingly we observed that it's not

00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:03,789
only you lose signal based on your

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,880
distance but based on actual position

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:10,389
right so it all depends on your RF and

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,760
tenor design patterns how they are how

00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:15,970
the antennas are designed and maybe you

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,850
due to multipath you get some fading so

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:21,070
if you want to if let's say AT&T or

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:25,210
Verizon or any other company wants to

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:27,190
provide 3d coverage then we need to

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,250
study how to provide a seamless coverage

00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:32,380
right either with beams like in 5g you

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,179
want to it's a beam based technology

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,070
possibly right I want to deploy beams in

00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:38,889
the air or omnidirectional

00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,929
but with it with today's technology it's

00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:42,909
the coverage is not guaranteed and many

00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:46,210
other papers have shown that with

00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:47,620
measurements and simulations another

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,779
interesting area is trajectory

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,870
optimization let's assume you want to

00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:55,389
fly from here to here so you can fly the

00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,740
shortest path but maybe the shortest

00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:58,690
path does not give you seamless

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,120
connectivity with with some ground

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,769
network right so if you don't have

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,070
seamless connectivity and this is

00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:12,820
connectivity is in the air of course you

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:15,490
another path may be more optimal and the

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,539
third example fine example this is

00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,519
something I'm interested in I'm

00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:21,429
interested in wireless research in Vilas

00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:23,440
security protocol Security

00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:25,389
I was with Virginia Tech we did some

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,639
great research with Marc Leishman was

00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:34,539
here on LTE 4G 4G security we tried to

00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:36,909
see is LT secure against control channel

00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:38,400
jamming essentially or spoofing and we

00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:43,080
found it's not it's

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,370
this it's performance drop significant

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,950
if you have some smart interference

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:49,110
there and there is there big government

00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,240
programs that want to use 5g for

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,600
military missions right so here what you

00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,490
want to do is you want to analyze v 4g

00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,720
and 5g networks and make them more

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:02,790
robust against RF signaling attacks and

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,370
spoofing attacks and other types of

00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:08,280
cyber attacks so you can imagine if you

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:11,070
have UAVs flying those UAVs can also be

00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:14,790
attackers right so they can try and try

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:16,110
to smartly jam some other users and how

00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,940
are they going to do this well we are

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,580
going to do I'm going to do research but

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,440
as an air puff platform representative

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:26,960
I'm going to offer you the tools to do

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:29,850
the research like interference waveforms

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,710
KPIs key performance indicators and

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,960
performance measurement counters that

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,720
you can observe of your 5g or 4G network

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:42,480
to see how much the interference effects

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:45,450
your system performance okay so I'm done

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,190
I'm almost done I just want to to give

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,170
this shout out we want to work with you

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:51,780
we are so excited if you have the

00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:53,250
privilege to build this platform and we

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,100
want to work with you and work with the

00:25:53,250 --> 00:26:00,410
community the software radio community a

00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:03,480
new radio community to be our colleagues

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:05,429
collaborators users whatever your role

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,330
you find appropriate for yourself and

00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:12,059
your business we are constantly looking

00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,840
for expanding our region of

00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,910
collaborators

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,130
and we also hiring I'm hiring at

00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,200
Mississippi State University as I said

00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,300
I'm a professor and I'm hiring students

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,580
but also hire postdocs and research

00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:27,960
faculty if you're interested in any of

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:30,100
this please contact me and join our team

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:36,710
thank you very much

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:38,820
[Applause]

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:41,510
we even have time for a question or

00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,590
maybe YouTube it's super short

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:47,400
congratulations for winning the award

00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:50,100
thank you so are you going to control

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,590
the drones if somebody is running

00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,200
Wireless experiments or like how is the

00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,940
flight flight path predetermined yeah

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,280
good questions so we can we can use

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,900
outer pilots but we are in the control

00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,270
of programming the other pilots based on

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,580
what you tell us you want to do but for

00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:08,610
now the FAA regulation requires one

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,310
person to observe one uh or control it

00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,920
directly so it depends on the experiment

00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:14,820
and of course all the other vehicles

00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,560
buses and so forth they have their own

00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,960
routes right we don't change those

00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,730
crowds we just put our radios there yeah

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,160
also the other question is you're

00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:27,480
talking about beyond the line of sight

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:31,770
yes um I have a license so far there are

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:35,010
only 47 licenses why was given to up to

00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:37,410
even operate beyond the line of sight do

00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,340
you think you can get you can run any

00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,230
experiments

00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,090
yes beyond the line of sight we are very

00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,120
confident we have two experts and I've

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,380
FAA licensing and we have other partners

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,390
with North Carolina and through a

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,610
Mississippi State there's a shure center

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:54,060
of excellence for unmanned aircraft

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:55,500
systems so we know what they need and

00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,030
other companies like I don't know

00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,640
Facebook Google and so forth they obtain

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:02,490
these licenses Boeing maybe so you're

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,500
confident that the more testing we do be

00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,930
and others do the easier it would be to

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:11,280
obtain those licenses to do those kind

00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:15,540
of experiments how long is the project

00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:18,330
period for getting the testbed ready for

00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,610
users great questions so after year one

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,980
you will be able to use it and we

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:25,200
already have some lead users people try

00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,060
to have things available for them to try

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,770
out earlier but next summer you're going

00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,510
to have a summer school and a demo and

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,940
you can start using a test been testing

00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:37,380
out the test but after year three the

00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:39,330
whole test should be operational so

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,130
great stuff I'm wondering about the

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,410
spectrum regulations how are you dealing

00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,830
with getting licenses or authorities to

00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,540
to transmit given all the

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,900
the sofa Capone radios and the frequency

00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,760
coverages that they are they can access

00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,790
versus frequency licensing in

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,200
regulations great questions so first of

00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:58,840
all the licenses you get from FCC

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,540
there's they call them innovations own

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,700
licenses and they have provided many of

00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:06,310
those for the other two test beds

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,840
already being built it goes from sub 1

00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:12,220
gigahertz to 28 and 39 gigahertz and

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,040
then how are we going to ensure that the

00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,320
users behave well to things the other

00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,660
test pets do and we may copy them or do

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,630
something differently they do RF

00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,640
monitoring in real time as fast as they

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:27,670
can and they shut down the radios if

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,980
something is out of out-of-band we are

00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:32,500
thinking maybe to use also RF Hardware

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,600
filters it depends how many licenses we

00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,850
have how many operational bands we have

00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,770
you may have a switch matrix with

00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,990
different filter ranges where we can

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:43,500
operate on different frequencies safely

00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:47,380
because we have the our Hardware filters

00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,910
thank you all right

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,130
well there's no more question that we

00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,910
can have a long-drawn off the round of

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,880
applause for book

00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:56,880
