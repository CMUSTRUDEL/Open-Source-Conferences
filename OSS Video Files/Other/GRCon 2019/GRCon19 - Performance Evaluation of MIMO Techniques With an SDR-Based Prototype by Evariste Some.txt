Description: 
	Performance Evaluation of MIMO Techniques With an SDR-Based Prototype by Evariste Some, Kevin K Gifford

There is tremendous pressure on modern wireless communication systems. First, there are more people than ever using wireless communications as their primary source of information and communication. Second, the data demand per user has exploded thanks to new mobile applications such as Facebook and Uber. Of note, data demand is being driven especially by streaming video. As a result, there has never been a greater need for finding creative solutions to improving networks’ performance, reliability, and efficiency. This paper examines the use of several different algorithms for wireless data transmission that can result in greater reliability and throughput based on the use of multiple channels – MIMO diversity and spatial division multiplexing techniques. The contribution of this work is to show through simulations and experiments that the reliability or throughput of a communication system can be significantly improved by using a combination of multiple channels based on open source and programmable hardware and software, and to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

all right I just feel I just feel being

00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:26,590
under pressure because I realized that

00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:32,829
I'm among the last people to present

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:37,390
today and it's not easy since Tuesday

00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:40,450
I saw people talking about my mo Tuesday

00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:43,989
my mood Wednesday my mood today my mo

00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:48,250
so I before getting here I question

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:51,120
myself what thing what kind of how to

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:57,490
structure how to critically break my

00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:00,700
presentation to make it useful so I

00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:03,280
change my presentation many times and we

00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:15,100
will see hopefully it would be useful in

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:20,229
some ways before I start so I would love

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:28,470
to say thank you to new radio for many

00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:28,470
reason first I don't lie to you a you

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,990
DSP through by more performing and so on

00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:42,490
without your contribution I wouldn't be

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:46,270
here just to let you know this is my

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:48,909
first time to attend a conference this

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,030
is my first time publishing a paper and

00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:55,900
this is my first time to be on this

00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:58,450
stage to speak to you so I would love to

00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:04,600
say thank you to all of you without your

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:07,270
contributions I wouldn't be here the

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,869
second ad I would like to make is to

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:15,970
give credit to someone named Luca

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:21,040
Schmidt I really use some of his work

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:24,219
tools to build what I have today Luca

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,120
fish mate I think he was admitted or

00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:32,950
last year 2018 gsok goo

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:36,430
most of google Summer of Code to

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:40,019
implement my new tip in cumulative

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:44,290
output and the beautiful story about

00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:46,959
Luca and I so when I learned that Luca

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,519
was in charge of permit my MOOC I

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:54,400
reached out to him and say can I

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,519
volunteer to do something and he said

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,000
yeah what we would like to do I don't

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,069
know

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,299
and he said well why not you just test

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,790
he's cold

00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:07,299
so whatever he programmed so I was in

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,959
charge

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:15,549
reeling true and tested because I have

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:19,269
Hardware USRP so I was able to test his

00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:23,230
code and learn from what he did so

00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:27,010
before I was not able to build a blog by

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:31,150
myself but because I volunteer to work

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:33,579
with him so today I'm able to produce

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,090
something all right

00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:41,019
now I will well has you see my neighbor

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:44,489
a barista assuming I'm a graduate

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:44,489
student at the University of Colorado

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:57,280
second year I I don't know yet where we

00:03:48,639 --> 00:04:01,169
are this program with n so I only have

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:05,139
two main subject why multi-input

00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:09,549
multi-output so there is an ape

00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:12,489
understand with motivation behind why

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:18,280
are we using multi pollutant output in

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:23,070
1g 2g it was only single input single

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,419
output why my mu is gaining momentum

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,789
nowadays

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:32,199
so there is an aim to find out the

00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:35,650
motivation and from a motivation so we

00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,210
can improve see okay what are with

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:41,710
different techniques that we have

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:44,340
nowadays all right and I propose to

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:48,639
techniques diversity technique and

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:53,590
spatial multiplexing this cause of time

00:04:48,639 --> 00:05:00,009
I wanted to add beamforming but it's in

00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:06,009
the same family so what's the motivation

00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:10,090
behind multiple muted out why are we

00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:13,960
using blue tape inclusive output you

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:17,080
convene with me that each of us

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:23,680
everybody want to have high speed on the

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:27,220
cell phone and to get their wireless

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,940
communication provider need to increase

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:35,289
the capacity but how can we increase

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:40,720
such capacity with a limited amount of

00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:46,000
spectrum just to remind you wireless

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:48,130
communication system has a big pressure

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,699
and you might say what are these

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:55,570
pressure everything works fine right

00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:59,500
think about there are more people than

00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,570
ever using wireless communication as a

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:08,889
primary source of communication and

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:13,030
information data requested by user has

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:15,669
exploded thanks to new mobile

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:19,570
applications such as YouTube Facebook

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:23,159
and so on well one might say well I

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:28,539
don't use social media okay fine

00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:32,280
the third reason wireless communication

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:37,120
provider are still using lower bandwidth

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:40,889
to provide services with a limited

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,650
capacity so how can we improve the

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:49,630
throughput without using different

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:52,719
techniques so to those who use 1g 2g I

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:55,180
think they are better off to explain

00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:58,060
your to give a definition of

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,280
the congestion me oh what a signal

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:05,889
perform when we signal sound to

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:09,250
degrading but there is hope because

00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:15,160
wireless communication has evolved over

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:18,820
the past decade with each phase bringing

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:22,440
its new and exciting capacity capability

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:28,330
and services to be end-user

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:32,380
we went from 1 G 2 2 G by adding SMS

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:37,270
from 2d to 3d you know we're able to use

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:39,250
the Internet that's fine 22:40 so that's

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,340
what we are most of us are living

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:47,500
nowadays so what was the main difference

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:52,810
between 3G and 4G in production of blue

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:57,759
tape input multi output for 4G most

00:07:52,810 --> 00:08:01,360
singers phone used two antennas nowadays

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,960
we have four antennas and some people

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:11,460
are talking about eight antennas but we

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:14,110
sydney time to reach that so with 5g

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,979
when you wait with specific a

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:21,580
specification shape five diplomas high

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:25,500
to put how can we which high throughput

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:30,370
without using the combination of

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:36,310
configuration of emotive antennas 5g

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:38,229
promise to reduce lowly tensing how can

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,900
we reach them without using the

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:47,110
configuration of immunity Fontenot so to

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:50,620
me not because I research a multi input

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:56,640
multi output and before me to me I feel

00:08:50,620 --> 00:09:00,850
at a mind Moe is the main piece in 5g

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,940
without using the tip antennas or what

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:08,310
they call massive MIMO even difficult

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,310
really to increase the throughput

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:18,630
so what did I do

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:21,760
what do I have to share with you I learn

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:26,520
many publication from you guys I really

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:32,650
love through new with your website and I

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:37,270
came to a play that I made to propose

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:41,260
something to you know so implementation

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:45,610
of multi-input multi-output using a new

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:50,080
review using open source and to do it I

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:55,210
went through main subject diversity

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:59,110
technique and in spatial multiplexing in

00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,760
a diversity technique we have well many

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,210
techniques in fact in diversity what

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:07,660
doesn't mean if I diversity made that

00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:10,810
the same signal that you send go through

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:17,040
YouTube channel so you have a multiple

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:20,410
copies of the same signal as a result

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,190
the probability that the signal will

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:29,410
fade is reduce because you are sending

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:33,010
out for the same signal muted copies so

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:39,490
the receiver will effectively receive at

00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:42,460
least some copies so diversity in fact

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,730
you realized you know the shrimp of

00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:51,730
diversity is the reliability of

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:56,080
communication the next action aspect

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:59,770
case of multiple YouTube output my more

00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:04,780
by definition they say my mo will

00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:09,040
increase the throughput I decided to use

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:12,480
analogy what's my mood in this case for

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,960
instance we have a highway on the

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,410
highway we have a motive land so

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,800
depending on the number of length if we

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,459
have a two lane

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:29,269
Foley obviously it will increase the

00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:35,569
capacity with traffic the morning we

00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:38,379
have so we can you know the flow can go

00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:41,439
faster it was same thing with my mo

00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:45,220
based on the number of antennae we have

00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:51,559
it from a base station to a receiver so

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:56,379
that we increase the throughput so we're

00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:58,189
2x2 MIMO we will increase in theory

00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:01,730
single-input single-output

00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:05,929
with four by four my mo will be increase

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:10,549
the capacity or two by two now something

00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:17,149
to adjust in this figure we have a base

00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:22,269
station and a cell phone apparently

00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:28,220
things look sweet my mood in fact

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:33,369
doesn't work without multipath so the

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:38,240
thing to remember it's just a way to

00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:42,069
picture but none of them tonight be

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,619
named from the base station and what

00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:47,839
trend need if a client is capable to

00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:50,029
have a two antennas obviously the base

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,299
station will dedicate two antennas to

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:55,369
communicate with if it's for the base

00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:58,399
station we dedicate for antennas to

00:12:55,369 --> 00:13:05,480
communicate with the client that's the

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:08,860
idea otherwise single don't propagate in

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,199
a straight path from the base station to

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:15,350
client it has worked my mom only works

00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:18,230
in multipath and that's one of the

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:22,100
reason in a rural environment we are

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:24,879
still having problem to implement such

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,879
as we my mo

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:40,580
in diversity technique what I did it to

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,610
use some tools to build this algorithm

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:49,399
alamou t many of you knows about an

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:52,520
abuti code so this is part of Luca

00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:58,580
Schmidt work so using encoder and a

00:13:52,520 --> 00:14:03,290
decoder the next one was to use

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:07,850
selection combining and maximum ratio

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:10,910
combining in selection combining the

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,810
album is pretty simple in fact selection

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:18,860
combining select with signal with with

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:24,350
high singer to noise ratio you know and

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:27,880
a pass that for decoding maximum ratio

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:31,490
combining is the kind of complex

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:37,190
algorithm but it has enterprise in terms

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:39,860
of performance so putting this together

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:44,120
I was able to build an application and

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:47,830
measure the output of ala booty

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:51,410
selection combining and a much of issue

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:56,300
combining obviously in the theory it

00:14:51,410 --> 00:15:01,250
said MRC hasn't effectiveness above

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:04,360
selection combining and alamou T one

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:09,410
question that very often you know come

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,420
every time is why how to choose a

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,630
particular algorithm either selection

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:18,050
combining or maximal ratio combining it

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:21,339
depend it depends because you need to

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,930
make the trade-off between complexity

00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:30,170
right and a performance

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:35,390
it depends with situation so if power

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:39,700
consumption is the a big price for you

00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,700
so you can make your choice

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:49,390
in a spatial multiplexing so I use zero

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:59,230
forcing and MMSE minimum mean square

00:15:49,390 --> 00:16:05,170
error so zero forcing cancel I say that

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:07,120
I saw inter symbol interference so it's

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:10,570
canceled inter symbol interference and

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:14,530
AM YouTube access interference by

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:18,040
designing a Nyquist tools or you can use

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:26,170
a Equalization true to compensate the

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:31,440
thing MMSE is it it in fact is an

00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:35,980
extension of a Co forcing but optimize

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,080
the signal to interference the Poisson

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:43,180
ratio

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:47,950
okay so using a decoder and cool the

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:50,320
first for zero forcing MSE and forward

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,980
decoder in fact we can see that we have

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,350
a minimum mean square error in fact you

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:59,050
can select either

00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:04,089
MLSE or zero force and depending are the

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:08,260
type of algorithm to use alright so

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:13,000
going through simulation why new radio

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:19,180
is awesome on the same page so as you

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:23,410
can see we have some constellation I put

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:26,199
some option for answer to vary energy

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:31,420
per bit and you can see with bit error

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:35,560
rate or performance and also a real-time

00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:37,330
display throughput one of the issue I

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:43,060
got to this point

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:49,900
I use a USRP and 210 in theory they said

00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:54,690
you can receive up to 25 mega sample per

00:17:49,900 --> 00:18:01,559
second but for some reason

00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:07,020
my USRP and to tell couldn't pass five

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:10,390
layer sample even after recalibration

00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:13,870
yeah I questioned myself but you know

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:18,460
it's a school with USRP have been

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:23,919
overused but I'm still looking for ways

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:28,780
to improve my hard way so if anybody has

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:31,210
a way to you know to pass at least from

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:37,059
five mega sample per second to at least

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:40,090
a 15 degree so after implementing if you

00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:43,330
force again and let's see so also I

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:47,640
compare with performance so the

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:49,390
performance and show that enemy see

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:54,690
effectiveness are always you know

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:57,610
forcing but I'd hi know we can see a

00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:06,130
conversions off with your forcing with

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:09,000
same level than MMSE so what to remember

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,000
to this

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,860
the growing demand for high data rate

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:19,450
increase we need to utilize spectrum

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:24,520
more efficiently it's true nowadays we

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:30,600
have higher spectrum but if we don't

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:33,610
learn how to use efficiently lower

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,970
bandwidth I don't think we will be able

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:41,350
to use efficiently autistic spectrum and

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:43,390
upper spectrum has its cost to the

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,890
second thing is using multiple antenna

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:50,010
configuration it can be used to overcome

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:54,190
with each mental effect of a single

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:56,350
multipath and fading depending on the

00:19:54,190 --> 00:20:00,340
type of implementation you want it can

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:03,250
be diversity of my mode and there are

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:06,690
many algorithm in diversity has a

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,690
normative input multi output

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:16,510
lastly implementation of a multi-channel

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:18,610
using new review is why please use and

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:23,740
support wireless communication research

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:27,580
I went from nothing but thanks to new

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:32,170
review you know I improve myself in how

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:36,610
to implement it broke all too white you

00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:41,940
know from given a mathematical formula

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:45,490
how to present that using a block so

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:49,180
there is no question you will post on a

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:51,610
new radio and you don't have answer so

00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,470
if I can do it I believe you guys can do

00:20:51,610 --> 00:21:05,350
it too

00:20:52,470 --> 00:21:07,510
so my presentation oh I'm thrilled that

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,000
you chose this is your first conference

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:13,540
I truly am and I'm doubly thrilled that

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,060
you got in touch with students from my

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,400
alma mater in cultural so that's cool

00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:22,960
Mia do we have any questions favorite

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:31,000
various on my mom we have one at the

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:32,710
back sorry it's more of a suggestion

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,880
just for something if you want to take a

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:37,510
look at it but transmit antenna

00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,190
selection just like a reduced complexity

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,500
version of my mo where instead of trans

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,600
beyond all the four transmit antennas

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:49,320
you could choose one of them and send

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:58,240
data that way yeah please give us your

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:59,020
performance well it's it depends on your

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,270
application

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:06,550
it depend on what you want to focus on

00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:08,770
obviously in the complexity like when

00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:12,750
you take an email see comparing to SC

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:17,140
selection combining implementation of

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:20,670
MRC doesn't cause too much cause I think

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,670
you can go for with MRC

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:32,290
do you have any more questions was our

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:34,780
hand raised no okay I have aggression

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,910
it's not exactly about my mother it's

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:42,940
more about choosing you know radio as a

00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:45,190
tool in university um I I often debate

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,740
with people universities about using the

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,410
radio and the argument usually goes this

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,810
way is like ah you know like when people

00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:55,780
use Guinea radio they also have to learn

00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,880
get and C++ and all those things if you

00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,550
just want to teach them communications

00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,680
and I say no no they have to learn gate

00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,210
and C++ and that's that's good so you

00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,580
know there's a bit of a overhead with

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,990
learning gonna radio well like do you

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,600
think that's an impediment to your work

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,060
I think that's ultimately useful when I

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:16,750
came to you with you frankly speaking I

00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:20,080
started using em blogs you know just

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:23,530
move abroad and interconnect them but

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:29,290
later on I wanted to build something on

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:31,420
my own so for those you know who use the

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:35,320
new radio website there is a process

00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,420
step by step how to build a blog it's

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,490
not difficult

00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:42,400
well you have two ways if you can

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:45,790
program in Python that's fine otherwise

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,540
and have a C++ either one is not

00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:51,700
complicated you just need to practice

00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:54,010
what's the difficult is come to

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,500
understand we are good what the

00:23:54,010 --> 00:24:01,450
algorithm does for answers when you take

00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:05,590
a MRC find out a book there are plenty

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:08,170
algorithm on how to do it so when you

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:11,950
have algorithm for remaining I think

00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:15,550
that state by state that's how I went

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:19,540
from you know using people code and

00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:24,010
later on look for to design something on

00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:27,160
my own so it's it doesn't happen one day

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:30,250
so it take time and a be patient in

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,750
learning okay

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,220
well

00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,450
we can have one final runner was for all

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:39,569
speakers today and

00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:39,569
