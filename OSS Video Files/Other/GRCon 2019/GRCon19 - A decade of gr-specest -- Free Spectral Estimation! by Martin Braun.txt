Description: 
	A decade of gr-specest -- Free Spectral Estimation! by Martin Braun

10 years ago, the Communications Engineering Lab (CEL) of KIT, Germany, published an out-of-tree module for GNU Radio: The spectral estimation toolbox (gr-specest). Today, it’s still around and works even with the latest master branch of GNU Radio (3.8-ready!).

In this talk, we shall discuss spectral estimation in general, and show how gr-specest can be used to solve spectral estimation problems. Furthermore, we shall discuss how gr-specest was plugged into the academic operations of the CEL, and how it benefitted undergraduates, the lab, and the community as a whole.

all right so I already gave a

00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,110
presentation yesterday I'm Martin I'm

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,150
with edit / National Instruments I'm

00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,560
also with beginning radio I'm an officer

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,270
but this is sort of a side project of

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,099
mine so this is all my own opinions I'm

00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,720
not representing anyone else and I'm

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,279
going to talk about it out of three

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,450
module called sheís by guest and I'm

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,430
also going to talk about spectral

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,020
estimate estimation and I'm not gonna

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,470
start at the very bottom like I'm gonna

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,760
assume absolutely no prior knowledge

00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,290
what is spectral estimation and as a

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,030
matter of fact like if you ask that

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,559
question like you should you should

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,070
start with what is estimation and

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,570
estimation theory so as almost everyone

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,859
in this room I have an engineering

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,989
degree and I have to say like in

00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,940
estimation fear was one of my my

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,339
favorite subjects but it was like a big

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,780
thing I had like two semesters just on

00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:02,789
estimation theory and there like another

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,190
semester on the DSP for spectral

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,460
estimation and probably more classes in

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,780
there so I can't summarize all of that

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,940
but the key thing to take away from

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,060
estimation to you rate it's like this is

00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,280
not guesswork like there is you have

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,730
stochastic inputs you have unambiguous

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,990
mathematical derived equations they

00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,860
produce some output and that is an

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,200
estimation and I just give you a couple

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,970
of easy examples so let's say we're

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,950
measuring a voltage or the noise here

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,170
with some noisy equipment for example

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,450
now we have to state some assumptions

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,010
for example we'll say okay my nose is

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,650
white Gaussian noise which always makes

00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,270
the math most easy and now like how do I

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,380
figure it like every time I measure my

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,390
voltage like it gives me a different

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,340
value like how do I know what it's

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,200
supposed to be and the answer is well I

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,850
just measure multiple times and you know

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,100
take the arithmetic average and then

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,900
people will say oh oh dr. Brown isn't

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,630
that what they give you pH D's for in

00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,860
Germany and I say hold on this is might

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,330
be intuitive and simple but I had to to

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,890
get to this equation I had to put in all

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:09,060
the correct inputs first and this is the

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,370
same is true for estimation you have to

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,989
like you know provide the entire chain

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,790
because what if my noise is not white

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,680
Gaussian and this no longer holds true

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,060
and you can apply this to other thing

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,220
it's like something I'm not very good at

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,740
or I should say this in public

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,260
um well something anyway you can also

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,630
play this M estimating software project

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,380
and there's actually also like like like

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,060
actual science

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,890
behind that you might not believe it so

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,350
there's like I picked the model from a

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,360
book on software estimation theory and

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,800
let's let's say you have one developer

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,390
and they say okay I've three tasks it

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,730
tastes blah blah blah many days like

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,560
there's some uncertainty in there you

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,540
actually model that uncertainty in an

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,830
appropriate sarcastic model and then you

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,380
say okay like I'm ninety percent can

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,640
cook 90 percent can confident this will

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,500
be done within twelve point four days

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,300
and then you round it up a little bit to

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,450
make it look less ridiculous but this is

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,950
not guessing this is still some

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,420
underlying mathematical model which I'm

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,680
not going to explain here for the lack

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,800
of time so the point I'm trying to make

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,930
here is estimation is solidly grounded

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,240
in math and the same is true for

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,970
spectral estimation so I give you you

00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,130
give me noisy inputs and then I provide

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,720
some model and then the output is the

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,610
spectrum estimate there what's the

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,530
spectrum that's the next question so if

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,240
you just put spectrum into Google like

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,770
you find out you know a wide spectrum of

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,010
pictures like there's all sorts of stuff

00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:30,810
that you can think of when you just you

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:32,070
know talk of a spectrum like which one

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,490
is the spectrum like one of them has to

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:38,490
be the spectrum and that is also not

00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:41,400
true like you first make a definition of

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,960
what your spectrum is and then you

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,330
derive your estimator based on your

00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,800
noisy inputs so I'm actually going to

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,130
give you multiple definitions for the

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,020
spectrum might be and I'm gonna start

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,820
with this here nonparametric spectral

00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,680
estimation some people also call it

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,360
traditional spectral estimation this is

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,580
a long title but actually you will

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,720
probably not be surprised to see what's

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,490
comment going to come up next so in this

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,459
case I say okay I actually want to

00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,020
estimate the power spectrum density and

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,900
this is like probably the only equations

00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,459
I have so like don't worry if the powers

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,330
the power spectrum density the power

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,790
spectrum density is typically notarised

00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,710
as s of Omega Omega being the frequency

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,530
and if you integrate over from like

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,540
Omega 0 to Omega 1 then that's the power

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,650
you get in that band so that's why it's

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,980
called the power spectral density so we

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,090
have this thing here X hat which is a

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,430
time-limited Fourier transform I'm being

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,229
a little bit unscientific yeah for the

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,220
sake of time but it's also I think

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,140
you're more

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,520
intuitive that way so this is not

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,560
exactly a Fourier transform because I'm

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,110
going only going over a limited amount

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,970
of time then I'm module square then have

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,420
the expected value of that and then I

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:58,840
have to go t equals up to infinity if we

00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:02,470
look at this here we actually recognize

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,030
a whole bunch of things before I talk

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,320
about them I also want to may just

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,940
mention for the sake of completeness

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,150
that there is an alternative way to

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,220
derive all of this where the power

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,810
spectrum density is defined as the is

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,700
the actual Fourier transform of the

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,310
autocorrelation function which itself is

00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:22,060
also an expected value of some

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,890
stochastic process if you care about

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,570
this these are called Carlo graham based

00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,290
methods I will not talk about them I

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,760
will go back to the left hand side and

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,120
you know just just follow this here X of

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,620
T is our is my signal this here is a you

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,030
know time limited Fourier transform

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,670
let's let's take that to the discrete

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,070
time like a time limited discrete time

00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,710
Fourier transform like we we just call

00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,110
that an F of T so like this entire thing

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,090
is an F of T this here is an expected

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,710
value of something I already mentioned

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,240
under certain circumstances expected

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,550
values can be easy to calculate by

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,680
arithmetic averages which is something

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,880
we do here and then this whole T up to

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,310
infinity thing we're gonna have to

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,990
approximate somehow so you know

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,360
sometimes it's okay to be an engineer

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,980
and just throw like the scientific rigor

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,990
a little bit overboard for the sake of

00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,230
practicality and that's what this guy

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,640
did

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,770
his name is Welsh and this is Welsh

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,180
mythic falls out of that you've probably

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,730
all heard of this I'm going to quickly

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,410
go through it again I was sitting in the

00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,970
library I didn't have like fancy graphic

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,740
tools so I actually drew this by hand so

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,710
I mentioned you have a noisy signal you

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,690
can see I approximated a sine wave here

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:30,460
you split your signal into segments of

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,960
time yeah they are take f of T's of that

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,090
and then the module squared of that you

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,740
get something like this there's still

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,260
plenty of noise here and then you take

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,970
as many of those as you like average

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,610
them and then this would be your output

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,200
and if you go back to my definition you

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,510
can find all the things that I mentioned

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,730
in there earlier so segmenting in time

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,729
so we can do F of T s that's our time

00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,440
limit of Fourier transform the module

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,000
squared was actually in the definition

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,310
of the power spectrum density so

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,500
not even approximating anything here and

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,860
then the more of these I take the more I

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,070
approximates t towards infinity so there

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,600
you go and you can even do this in real

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,700
time by saying okay I'm just going to

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,710
limit this to say I don't know like

00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,600
thirty-two averages and then I'm gonna

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,950
sort of always feed and in uff he

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,230
dropped the oldest one and that's how I

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,090
can like to sort of a time sort of a

00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,830
continuous update of my my spectral

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,340
estimates so that's way of doing it of

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,230
doing spectral estimation and I was

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,480
kidding I was saying this is actually

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:33,010
about GS Becca's so you can find this in

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,840
your radio looks like this yeah so what

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,850
do we have we have this block called

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,680
Welsh spectrum estimator and you put in

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:42,190
a bunch of parameters and you can see

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,150
the parameters here overlap is how much

00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,280
you actually want to overlap the

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,050
segments but more importantly you have

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,270
an F of T size which I have as variable

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,400
here set to 1024 how many of those I

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,280
want to average and a window function

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,419
which I will talk about in a bit I

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,919
instantiate it four of these just to

00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:57,340
give different results and I hope this

00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,919
works

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,940
oh thank god here's four different

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,310
results

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,590
I know if you see this jumping thing

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,180
here I wasn't quite sure why that comes

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,070
from I think it's actually the degree

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,200
that does that it's not supposed to be

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,790
part of the estimation what I input here

00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,260
was just two unrelated signals one of

00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,960
them is a sinusoid and one of them is a

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,669
gmsk signal and I just varied the

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,030
parameters you can see like here I have

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:24,520
a smaller T size so it's a little bit

00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,500
more coarse and there's like various

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,780
other parameters that we can change you

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,419
get different types of estimates I'll go

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,339
into those in a little bit the point is

00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:35,140
these are all valid spectral estimates

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,839
they're all different because they all

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,390
serve a different purpose and they all

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,440
use the same algorithm with different

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,510
parameters so why is it called

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,520
nonparametric if I have parameters the

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,350
parameters are not about the algorithm

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,820
but about the spectrum so the spectrum

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,560
does not have parameters which means I

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,370
can feed any type of signal in here and

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,339
it'll always give me a useful output

00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:00,490
okay so this is my intro to spectrum

00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:03,730
estimation there are plenty of nuances

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,860
here and a little thing that I want to

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,450
throw out to you is if you you know want

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,680
to look at one of these estimates we

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,960
actually have something you know radio

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,800
called

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,780
QG frequency sync what is that

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,150
I actually compare those yeah so Welsh

00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,890
mech term estimator versus the Cutie of

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,540
gree frequencies saying in this case

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,550
first thing you will notice is that this

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,410
guy is sort of a like one-stop shop for

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,810
spectral estimation this actually just

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,610
does the math and output stuff and then

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,810
I have to plot it myself so that's the

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,070
first difference if I run in first of

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,780
all like the cue degree frequencies

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,400
thing doesn't have this bouncy bug so

00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,930
that's good but other than that

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,280
depending on the parameters you choose

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:45,050
they actually look very similar so why

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,130
should I use one over the other and the

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,780
answer is it doesn't really matter as

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,490
long as you know what you're doing so

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,020
the the cue degree of frequency is

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,420
saying has a couple of differences it

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,010
will drop a whole bunch of samples which

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,350
means it's technically not quite as

00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,540
accurate but the only purpose of this

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,250
thing is for you to look at it so it

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,260
doesn't have to be perfect because your

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,510
your human eye can track the spectrum

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:09,500
anyway that was that well then the other

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:12,020
thing it does it uses a single pole iír

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,330
instead of a true moving average filter

00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,160
which is simply more efficient and which

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,870
is also fine so we just basically drop

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,850
some of the the scientific rigour of

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,310
Wealth's algorithm which we don't need

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,710
for performance sake if you were to do

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,840
post processing of the signal where you

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,030
actually need like every every sample

00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,470
every bin of the output to be exactly as

00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,240
you expect it from your equation then

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,780
you would use this that's that's pretty

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,340
much it

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:40,190
oh that was my demo however learning how

00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,170
to read these outputs is not as simple

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,790
as it looks like like I mean sure you

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,190
can put it on the frequency singer

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,720
here's energy here's no energy that's it

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,130
but like you can actually like change

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,710
the parameters in a way that will give

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,470
you suddle different results so I'm

00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:58,250
gonna run another demo here and this is

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,390
I hope they all fit so actually you know

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,190
sorry I didn't want to show the flow

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,190
graph before I show the results so what

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,960
am I actually doing here I'm adding some

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,790
noise just so I have a noise background

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,870
other than that I'm gonna put in two

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:15,020
sine waves with the same exact amplitude

00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:19,970
and I'm gonna plot the result four times

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:22,550
in two different windows keep in mind

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:26,440
I'm putting in the same signal

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:32,720
twice okay plus noise whoops where's my

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:37,040
where's my radio oh here we are okay so

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,360
I put in let's say I put in two

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,530
different estimates in the top blue and

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,420
in red two different estimates on the

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,650
bottom and blue and in red I could put

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,690
them in the same window because they're

00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,000
using different FFT sizes which is

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,590
already the first thing but let's look

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,940
at let's ignore this guy here the blue

00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,670
one look I just look at the red one it

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,610
looks kind of nice we have two tones so

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,840
at first glance this is what we expect

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,940
actually here's a question like what

00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,200
what is like I didn't tell you what what

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,440
noise I put in here what is the

00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,540
signal-to-noise ratio of this of this

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,740
horn you know what what do you think I

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,150
need just shout out a number I know

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,650
sorry

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,300
50 there you go great number why not

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,300
because here we have 20 here we have

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,200
minus 30 whatever you see would have

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,090
said I would have said the answer is

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,010
wrong because the correct answer to the

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:24,740
question is what is your definition of

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,780
the signal-to-noise ratio because I said

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,770
I put it the exact same signal twice

00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:34,700
this is 50 here it's if you go by your

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,920
logic it's 48 and here it's actually you

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,270
have to zoom in to see that but this guy

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,560
is also a little bit lower than that guy

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,740
so this would be 50 and this would be

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,360
like 47 or something doesn't really make

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,620
sense okay like how can this signal to

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,080
noise ratio be different and that's

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,540
because the parameters of my spectral

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,180
estimation or my estimate actually

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,100
matter for this case so what's going on

00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,840
here

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,120
okay who's paying attention why is the

00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,830
why is the signal-to-noise ratio higher

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,870
in the top picture versus the bottom

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:07,220
picture thank you Tom yeah this is

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,230
different I said that at the beginning

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,910
and why does the f of t size matter well

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,960
there's different ways to think about it

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,110
like depending how you want to visualize

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,760
it so the F of T filter is kind of a

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,730
match filter for sinusoids so you

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:24,050
integrate over a longer period thus at

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:25,700
the top you you just you know just you

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,400
just have more stuff you could also

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,500
think of it differently that the the

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,780
sine wave will also drop in exactly one

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,010
bin no matter how many bins I have but

00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,630
the noise will always have to will

00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,350
always spread out over all the bins so I

00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,760
have more bin

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,290
and the top so I have to like put you

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,900
know divide the energy on a more bin so

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,060
it'll go down a bit and another way to

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,090
look at it is like this here is a pretty

00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,100
sharp line whereas here it's not so like

00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,500
if you think of it like as integrating

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,450
over the the frequency domain like I'm

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,890
basically putting some of the energy and

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,220
looks like the width where here it's

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,740
like higher okay so that's that's one

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,560
part of it then why is this guy here

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:09,590
lower than that guy any guesses

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:14,360
you can't Marcus exactly

00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:15,860
so unfortunately on this resolution you

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,540
can't see everything at once but I

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,500
actually I actually like deliberately

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:24,740
put them like on on like you know bad

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,070
offsets so if I move it around it'll

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,920
like it'll it'll change and then finally

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:36,560
what is what is all of this here oh

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:38,480
sorry so I kind of skirt it over that at

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,370
the beginning but before calculating

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,960
actual T's we can multiply our single

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:47,990
with window functions and that also

00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:51,200
matters so in the way a window function

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:54,110
is basically a time domain function that

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,170
we apply to our signal first if we don't

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,000
apply a window which we do here we do

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:02,390
not apply window in this case you will

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,220
see these these side lobes and if you

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,740
think about it again like just trying to

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,810
sort of visualize all of this like there

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,520
has to be some energy in this in this

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,430
little side lobe that that is not here

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,630
which means the left-hand tone will be a

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,580
bit higher than the right-hand turn

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,680
which is the case you can barely make it

00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,060
out like the one get one is a little bit

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,740
above the line the others bit a little

00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,660
bit below the line but if you're like

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,760
trying to sort of measure your hardware

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,960
to like like like less than a DB

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,950
accuracy you have to think of these

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:34,460
things which makes you wonder where's my

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:37,160
slides which makes you wonder is if I'm

00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:41,030
really just just measuring sinusoids is

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,160
this really the best way to go and turns

00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,990
out there is alternatives to that for

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,860
example when we look at parametric

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:51,430
spectral estimation so

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:53,320
let's say I know absolutely sure like no

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,060
doubt about it that I will only have

00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,459
white noise and sinusoids there will be

00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,170
nothing else then I can have an

00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:01,329
alternative definition for my spectrum

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,490
which is this here so I just say okay

00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:07,029
have like you know e to the J blah blah

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:10,329
blah that's my sinusoid I add noise then

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:12,910
then all that I care about is my

00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:16,240
amplitude alpha and my frequency Omega

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:18,880
so my spectrum is is a set of alphas and

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,200
omegas that's it it's not like a

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:27,370
squiggly warrant line thingy so there

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,930
are subspace based methods called music

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,610
and it's free which do exactly that

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,890
there's also other methods that have

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,060
come a bit later which we do not have in

00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,839
speakers so I'm not going to talk about

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:42,190
them which are actually effective for

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,170
this kind of applications so same a very

00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:47,800
similar set up here I have noise I have

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:50,410
two sine waves and here's my it's free

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,940
frequency estimator that might have some

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,339
parameters which I will go into in a in

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,820
a sec I'm gonna hit run and there's my

00:16:54,339 --> 00:17:01,050
output and so I have two frequencies

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:05,740
going in point 1 and point 2 normalized

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:08,169
and I have two outputs point one and

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,730
point two this is kind of unexcited like

00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:11,949
if you look at it you feel like alright

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,510
well it's just boring there's just

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,329
numbers but that's exactly what you

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,549
wanted like your your well my model of

00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:21,459
the spectrum was it was not like a plot

00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:23,860
of you know XY it was it was a set of

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,329
numbers so here's your set of numbers so

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,010
this is actually a gentleman frequency

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:31,360
estimators maybe it's just not what you

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:33,309
might think of when you do that however

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,840
if you do like plots there is also

00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:38,559
something called a pseudo spectrum that

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,360
you can also derive from here I only

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,650
have one tone in this example and this

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,940
is what it looks like so uhm this is not

00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,230
exactly the same as the output of the

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,299
Welsh and you can see like we have like

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:53,710
this smooth line so obviously something

00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:56,410
is different this is also another way of

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,059
visualizing a spectrum I don't actually

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,370
know of any practical applications of

00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:01,730
doing this but it helps when you sort of

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,530
learn about the algorithm

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,090
does anyone know a practical application

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,130
of like plotting a pseudo spectrum in

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:27,350
this for you because I like I only know

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:29,840
what countered it in in classroom okay

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,700
so that's so that's a really good point

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,410
on why these methods are useful you need

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,330
very small number of samples to

00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,770
calculate the spectra I was like

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,120
specifically asking why would you plot

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:45,140
that because like computers like take

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:47,330
the numbers as an input okay well first

00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,920
Marcus is great answer now I'm Darrell

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,370
my right train of thought a little bit

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,260
peak on my next slide oh yeah okay so um

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,880
I don't have time to go into math of a

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,290
screen music if you know a linear

00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,090
algebra well it's actually not that

00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:02,360
difficult and if you don't then it is

00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:07,370
difficult so I I had to just like opt

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:10,700
out of explaining the how these bees

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:13,940
work one thing that we need to know

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,220
about though is we actually use a so

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:20,390
called covariance matrix as an input to

00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,490
our to our frequency estimator and that

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:25,340
covariance matrix itself needs to be

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,230
estimated so I'm just going to quickly

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,270
show the parameters of this block you

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,070
have to tell it the number of sinusoids

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,350
that you expect that is there are ways

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,240
of not doing that but like in this

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,580
particular case you have to know that

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,410
and then you will also give it two

00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,120
parameters two for the actual

00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:44,900
calculation or estimation of the

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,250
covariance matrix which is its dimension

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,290
and the dimension should be bigger than

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,000
the number of sinusoids and also like

00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:53,030
how many samples you want to input to

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,560
that so you can increase the number of

00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,960
samples that used to estimate your

00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,350
covariance matrix but then you will need

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,540
more samples eventually you give up one

00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:08,360
of the advantages of this particular

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:09,800
algorithm okay so we you know we changed

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,690
a sort of thought pattern said okay I'm

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,880
gonna sort of say my spectrum is a bunch

00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,580
of sinusoids and noise that's it

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,490
is there anything else we can do

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,020
there is an completely like a similar

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,060
but like different way of thinking about

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:26,500
it which is something like this let's

00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:30,630
say the signal that I'm estimating is

00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:33,010
actually modeled as like some noise

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:35,770
which is then going through a filter and

00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:40,210
then we we observe the output here and

00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:42,340
now what we want to do is not look at

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,710
the like the cumulative signal at the

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,180
end but we want to back calculate where

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,980
that filter was that originally went

00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,670
into that that is also a method of

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:54,100
spectral estimation I hope I can

00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,630
visualize as well enough for you guys so

00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,080
here's a here's a flow graph so I'm

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,120
literally producing noise I'm sending it

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,960
through a through a filter it's an IIR

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:08,560
felt in this case so it's a an

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,210
autoregressive model and I will show you

00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,760
the actual spectrum the output of this

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,350
guy but also I'm going to use this guy

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,450
which is the Berg spectrum estimator

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:20,320
Burke's method or spectral summation and

00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:22,150
this here I will give a little bit of a

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,560
little bit of a clue what's going on by

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,330
telling it like the model or what I'm

00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,860
gonna say like you're supposed to try

00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,770
and figure out what this filter was and

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,870
it's its model order like the number of

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:35,320
coefficients and it's a polynomial does

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:39,940
not exceed 6 that's it you go figure it

00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:43,420
out and then this here will produce a

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:49,870
pseudo spectrum on its own okay let's

00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:52,480
run this so what do we see here

00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:56,200
in red we see the shape of the actual

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,060
filter and in blue we see the output of

00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,950
the Welch estimator so you can see the

00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,450
Proxima it's like the filter but we have

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,770
those noise squiggles in there and I say

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,730
there we don't actually want those like

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,210
we don't care about that

00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,320
like they're just exciting the filter

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,930
but like that that's actually not what

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,210
we wanted so instead we use Burke's

00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,980
method the Burke's method we've told you

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,730
are supposed to figure out which filter

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,990
was the input to this signal and I did

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,060
get the scaling wrong and I couldn't

00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,830
quite fix it in time for this talk but

00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,890
other than the bouncy bug which i think

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,870
is not part of the algorithm you can see

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,320
that the difference between this blue

00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,200
line

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,909
and this red line is you know it's much

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,600
much better than than at the top because

00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:39,250
I actually get a pretty good idea of

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,200
what the original coefficients were that

00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:45,669
went into that okay so I've been blazing

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,190
through like like I said like three

00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:50,500
semesters at least of electrical

00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:56,080
engineering stuff just to give you an

00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:57,100
overview of you know spectral estimation

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,200
but I didn't want to talk about this

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,269
particular out of tree module a little

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,100
bit because how did it come about and it

00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:04,779
was actually published ten years ago by

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,789
a bunch of people including myself at

00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:09,220
this CEO like that's the communications

00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:12,389
engineering lab at the ki t in Germany

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,559
it's a university in Germany and a

00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:16,509
friend of mine against Elsa who some of

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,370
you might know and I we were faced with

00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:19,720
a interesting problem because we were

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,340
switching to the bachelor master

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,590
educational system which you've always

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,649
had but we only acquired and I don't

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:29,259
know two thousand something and the

00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:31,509
particular problem we needed to solve

00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:33,580
was that we were getting students that

00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:35,559
were undergraduate you know students and

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,029
within our curriculum they were supposed

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,980
to do a project at the end of their

00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:40,120
degree like their bachelor's degree but

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,769
they only had like two and a half

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,539
semesters worth of classes so we're like

00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:45,909
we don't actually have an experience

00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:47,320
dealing with that and and it had to

00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:49,720
solve everything of course like so they

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,850
needed to be theoretically challenged in

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,100
order to go into an academic career like

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,929
a masters or a PhD degree they needed to

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,250
do get some practical experience because

00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:58,509
they could also leave the university and

00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,799
go work for a company and then we

00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:03,940
wouldn't want to be you know embarrassed

00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:07,750
by having produced subpar students and

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:09,909
it just should be fun and cool so we we

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,639
were for some reason we were like doing

00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:13,720
spectral estimation research anyway so

00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:16,360
we said you know what we're just gonna

00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,820
let them implement every single spectral

00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,379
estimation algorithm there is and this

00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,620
turned out to be a great idea

00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:25,120
so from so many reasons so first of all

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,250
it solved it ticked all of those boxes

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,710
this was like not too difficult but it

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,629
had like everything in there it exposed

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,460
people who not just like textbooks a lot

00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:35,470
of math but also to like the open source

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,510
community and like having to show your

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,279
own code and you know like yeah your

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,250
dirty laundry and you know push it out

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,820
in public and so we you know we did we

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,929
put it out

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,120
mailing list and this was like long

00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:48,340
before jock on so I didn't know any one

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,049
of these people in person and then you

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,610
know we got a lot of encouragement from

00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:52,840
Tom mundo for example and made edits

00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,710
they were like oh this is great like you

00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,539
should do more of that

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,000
so we we went into this into this

00:24:55,539 --> 00:25:00,250
feedback loop of like we're like oh this

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,630
is like people are interested and um you

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,720
know we kept publishing more and

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:06,880
multispectral estimation algorithms so

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,059
we implemented all of these here over

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,440
the over the years I didn't talk about

00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:14,230
all of them in particular I left out

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,200
cyclo stationary processing there is a

00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,370
very well-known algorithm called the FFT

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,730
accumulation method which is also

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:23,289
implemented we also added some tools

00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,409
which were just not available in like

00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:29,169
upstream green radio nothing fancy just

00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:32,830
like something you need to calculate

00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:34,179
these various algorithms and the cool

00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,710
thing is about this is this is still

00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:37,809
running code like you can see like I'm

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,129
running it on 3.8 right now so we

00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:41,080
started at 10 years ago it's still

00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:47,200
available still works and I think that's

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:50,259
pretty impressive and just I'm just so

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,759
um what did we got out of Jeff's packet

00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:54,279
other than spectral estimation

00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,289
algorithms so a couple of cool little

00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:57,610
fun fact yes so there was a group of

00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:00,460
students and Marcus was actually one of

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:06,690
them who implemented the the music and

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:09,669
his freedoms and they also benchmarked

00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,690
various linear algebra libraries and I

00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:12,100
don't think the results are still

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,929
accurate so I don't want to like quote

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,120
those but at the time it turned out just

00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:18,250
a running native Fortran was the fastest

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,450
so guys what we had Fortran this is like

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:26,259
I made this screenshot like I'm sorry I

00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:28,059
it was most full okay hey Morris but we

00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:31,870
have running Fortran code it still works

00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:33,789
so we have Fortran code in in good radio

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,279
so I think that's pretty nice but it

00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:38,620
also like led to so many other things so

00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:40,330
we published more and more out of tree

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,490
modules we got sick of doing that by

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:44,320
hand we created module like you might

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,970
have used gr module in the past that

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,950
sort of everything exactly born out of

00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,750
spec s but it was like one of the seeds

00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,039
that went into that and there's another

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,010
thing that we learned which was the sort

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,539
of business sense yeah

00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,640
there's a lot of anxiety about

00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:59,590
publishing stuff that's

00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,390
and I'm not quite sure why because

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,070
there's so many students you can't

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,840
capitalize whenever every single line of

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,940
code that students write you know you

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,270
can't spin every student's a bachelor's

00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,770
project into a into a startup we

00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,980
actually got a lot out of doing this

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:17,770
because we've got so much you know

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,570
notoriety like PR out of this so you

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,250
know students wanted to join our group

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,170
because they saw that you could like old

00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,390
like do open source stuff while not

00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:27,730
sacrificing you know I you know this was

00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,320
not an impediment to your academic

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:32,320
career this was actually like part of it

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,940
and we went to you know jack on and yeah

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,260
I showed up at first Jack on like

00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,000
everyone knew who I was like because

00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:41,500
like stuff like this and I was like whoa

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,940
this is pretty pretty cool and so you

00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,080
know and it made us a little more

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,820
business savvy in a way that way you

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,169
know like if you if you're not open

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,090
sourcing code but you're also not

00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:52,179
selling it then you've you know you've

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:55,090
basically lost not necessarily money but

00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:58,419
maybe some kind of of currency that you

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:00,940
know could be reputation or something so

00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:03,370
it opened our eyes to to you know to

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:06,760
that kind of thinking as well all right

00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:08,320
I know I blazed through like a million

00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,910
things at once and I hope this wasn't

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:15,460
too fast and all to try to make up a

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:17,210
little time yeah excellent all right all

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:23,150
right thank you very much

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:23,150
