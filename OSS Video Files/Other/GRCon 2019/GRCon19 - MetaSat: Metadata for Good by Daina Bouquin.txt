Description: 
	MetaSat: Metadata for Good by Daina Bouquin

The small satellite community needs comprehensive access to mission enabling information and the ability to broadly share their knowledge and experience. The MetaSat schema aims to address these needs by functioning as a common way of describing hardware, software, and data specifications across missions to improve interoperability between them. In this way MetaSat will improve access to mission artifacts and enable their reuse by others. However, for the MetaSat team to fully support the diverse small satellite community and incorporate their quickly changing needs into the schema, they need to work directly with the stakeholders throughout the design process. This presentation will update the community on MetSat’s progress and introduce attendees to ways they can help shape the schema’s development.

	00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,480
so hi I'm glad to get the chance to talk

00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,150
to you all and I figured it would be

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,460
helpful to start with Who I am

00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,779
Ben alluded to the fact that you had a

00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,739
librarian in your midst so to speak

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,250
yesterday and that would be me

00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:37,660
so my name is Dana Bachmann I'm the head

00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,630
librarian of the harvard-smithsonian

00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,370
Center for Astrophysics I am appointed

00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,130
separately through Harvard University

00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,070
and the Smithsonian so I am Harvard's

00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,990
librarian for Astrophysics and the

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:54,010
Smithsonian's librarian for astronomy

00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:55,600
and astrophysics so sometimes I don't

00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,030
really have much of a picture in my mind

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,790
I guess of what people might associate

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,910
me with or what they must think I do but

00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,759
if there's like a relatively negative

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,310
pretty wrong very old picture in

00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:11,770
people's minds sometimes of what a

00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,320
librarian does and what I would do then

00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,119
and so I thought it would be helpful to

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,010
kind of point out some of the things

00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:22,600
that you might might be aware of that

00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,820
would give you a little bit more context

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,640
or the kinds of work that I do because

00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm going to talk to you about metadata

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:35,710
so the better metadata is the less you

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,930
know it's there and so I work with like

00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,270
the group archive so the big preprint

00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,810
server for astronomy and fit and physics

00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,610
and astrophysics more broadly I am part

00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,280
of the team that is the archive for

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,619
archive so I'm on the IT advisory group

00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,900
for that I work with the American

00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:54,820
Astronomical Association to figure out

00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,380
how we define what astronomy is so all

00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,020
the way that all of the literature is

00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,840
indexed on the 80s if you know what that

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,270
is that means something to you basically

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,280
all of the astronomer literature stuff

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,319
happens in my library the 80s is in my

00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,450
library I worked at the software

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,730
preservation Network so all of the

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,230
people who are trying to crawl the

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,760
internet to make sure all the code that

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,280
you're writing doesn't disappear into

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,840
oblivion we're working on making box for

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,640
that and I work at the Mozilla

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,889
Foundation so I'm part of their open

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,200
leadership program and so I mentor

00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:27,880
different groups on how to make their

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,880
stuff more open

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,580
accessible and as far as my background

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,720
sometimes it's a little bit helpful to

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:41,860
kind of clarify more why I might have

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,260
some ethos to provide on a topic so why

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,390
am i trustworthy I do have a background

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,810
in analytics I focus on computational

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:53,380
math in addition to my work in

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,570
information science so I'm here to talk

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,500
to you from that perspective about a

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:02,140
project called medicine and so

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,630
essentially that is a project where

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,720
we're trying to define metadata for

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,850
small satellite missions and I'll get

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,340
more into all of the motivations for

00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:16,840
that but essentially before we start

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,160
talking about like what the project is I

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,380
figured I'd tell you some of the people

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,990
who I'm working with so that you know a

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,600
little bit more who's who all else is in

00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:29,050
the room even if it's not just like me

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,640
on a stage so I'm the PI of Metis at and

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,340
funding is coming from the sloan

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,080
foundation they are wonderful and right

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,870
now we're working very closely with the

00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,270
Liebherr Space Foundation which is a

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,700
foundation based in Greece that's

00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,710
working on making small satellites much

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,410
more accessible and all of space much

00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:51,430
more open and I'm working with NASA

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:53,710
so Libra space has already agreed to be

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,770
our first implementation of the metadata

00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,630
that we define so that you'll be able to

00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,760
use their network of open ground

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,260
stations to schedule satellite missions

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,110
and we'll be able to fully and

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,120
comprehensively describe essentially all

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,890
of those observations and the artifacts

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,870
that are tied to them in addition to the

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,950
people and the objects within the

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,810
mission themselves I'm working with the

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,459
office of the chief technologist so that

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,739
what we're doing we'll be able to be

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,150
incorporated into NASA use cases and

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:28,330
implemented on relevant NASA systems so

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:31,150
all that I guess is to say when I'm

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,920
talking about metadata you will probably

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,500
not know when you're interacting with it

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,110
but if you interact with any of the

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,910
systems that implement it that's where

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,180
it'll be manifested so we're not talking

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,220
about designing a

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:48,080
cific database I'm not talking about

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,389
designing some kind of application of

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,220
any kind I'm talking about the

00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:57,680
conceptual framework of semantics so I

00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,870
don't know if you're familiar with the

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,780
term semantics but usually when I when

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,130
you hear semantics the way people use

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,310
that it's kind of like saying oh it's in

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,400
semantics it's just kind of a throwaway

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:14,509
but semantics is an entire field and so

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,400
this is a way that we define all of the

00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:19,820
relationships between what I am going to

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,590
refer to as signifiers so not just words

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:27,349
and terms a degree symbol as a signifier

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:29,660
so what do things mean and what do they

00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:31,970
stand for in reality because different

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,280
people have different ways of using the

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,889
same words to mean radically different

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,090
things I got and they just don't have

00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,240
agreement about what anything means

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,830
really and so the only way that you can

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,300
actually know what someone means when

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,490
they say something to you is that you

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,740
use all of the knowledge and all of your

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,840
world experience and all of the context

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,610
around you to make meaning of what

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,289
people are saying to you it's not just a

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,260
lookup table in your head where you know

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,630
what a word means I got into my uber

00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,789
just on the way here and I got in the

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,870
car and the driver immediately said oh

00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:07,580
happy peppermint Thursday no idea what's

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,650
happening he handed me a peppermint and

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,159
apparently this is this is the long and

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,659
short of what peppermint Thursday is but

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:20,270
Thursday to me has never meant that

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:22,400
before right so actually tonight for me

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,710
this is an aparment rapers of birth day

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,580
so the woman who funded the development

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:31,729
of the first all-sky survey so today's

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,340
her birthday so happy birthday Anna so

00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,900
different people bring completely

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,300
different meaning to something that can

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:42,050
be sometimes seeming relatively simple

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,509
and where we put those signifiers when

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,070
we decide what something means in a

00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:48,590
certain context we put it in something

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,870
called a lexicon so you might think of

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,300
this as a dictionary where you have like

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,720
this is our list of appropriate ways we

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,080
know a thing but different

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,840
branches of knowledge can have totally

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,700
different lexicons so in astronomy when

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,850
I say observer that means something

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,860
specific I am a non observer in

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,510
astronomy this doesn't mean I'm not

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,650
observant though

00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:16,620
and so like different contexts can it be

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:20,610
needed for the same words any given

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:23,100
lexicon so all of our signifiers can get

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,020
gathered up into a particular context

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,970
and then we use that to interpret each

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,640
other and because we're humans and we're

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,470
not robots we're really smart so

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,210
computers are really dumb they only know

00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,220
what you tell them and so we're making

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,450
all of these connections constantly and

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,890
machine learning and artificial

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,800
intelligence were trying to emulate

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:45,150
basically that behavior by creating all

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,950
of the known signifier relationships and

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:51,260
trying to get a computer to figure out

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:53,790
the ones that we didn't tell it ok so

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,940
when I say I want to make metadata for a

00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,610
mission what do I mean so for space

00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:04,380
missions because mission can mean a lot

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,669
of things so when you say its mission I

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,410
just looked up like what are the what is

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:08,700
the kind of base of what that means to

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,590
most people so it's an important or a

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,290
complex assignment in this case

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,910
typically involving travel so it's a

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,120
thing we're gonna go do it's an

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:21,120
assignment it's a task to be carried out

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,210
but it can also be a feeling so a

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,030
calling in aim it's something that a

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,419
group decides matters and so we're going

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:32,669
to go carry it out so you can have a

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:34,169
diplomatic mission you don't always have

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,510
a space mission you're not always going

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,610
on a journey but you have something you

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,020
need to do because it's important and

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,900
it's also sometimes a body of people

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,970
it's a group so what you can have a

00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,770
mission you can have a religious mission

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,930
you can have a mission established

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,510
someplace it's a group of people who've

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,710
come together and they have a task that

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,370
they carry out because they've decided

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,710
as important so mission can mean many

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:03,870
many things and sometimes it's all of

00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:06,000
the things so usually we're not trying

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,340
to tweeze out in our minds one of those

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,730
meanings right because the word

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:14,360
to conveys a lot and we only know what

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,279
is being conveyed by the context and so

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,700
this is actually a picture I want to

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,080
make this bigger yay so hopefully you

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,260
can actually read that then so this is

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,140
image from 1998 this is the Mars climate

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,650
orbiter undergoing some acoustic testing

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,740
Thank You NASA for the image rights this

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:38,540
is a group of people with an important

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:42,020
assignment they are sacrificing to do it

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,279
this is a very expensive task I expect

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,779
they're all working together on

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,790
something that is groundbreaking let's

00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,460
do something interesting let's leave the

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,810
planet and find something out new about

00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,490
something that only I don't know

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,490
thousand years ago we didn't know exist

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:05,820
but it can mean something else too

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:08,100
so the Mars climate orbiter I don't know

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,589
if you all know this story but

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,330
essentially this mission was lost and we

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:15,990
have a bunch of really fun alliterative

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:20,970
headlines so metric math mistake muffles

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:23,460
muffled Mars meteorology mission so

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,230
essentially what happened was despite

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,790
this really important mission these huge

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,700
investments this whole group of people

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:33,000
sending this thing to Mars to learn more

00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,950
about the climate of another world all

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,210
of that mattered a lot but still

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,300
mistakes can be made because

00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,050
communication is hard

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,600
communication was hard conveying meaning

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,900
is hard essentially impulse from

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:51,030
thrusters was being communicated from by

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:53,209
software in feet and pounds but the tool

00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:56,550
that was meant to interpret the thrust

00:10:53,209 --> 00:11:02,310
was expecting that information in

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:05,490
kilograms and in meters right and so

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:08,330
what happened was a miscommunication in

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:11,850
systems among people in this big group

00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:14,970
because the details matter the semantics

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:17,360
matter and even if they're speaking

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,400
different languages the software is dumb

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,660
it didn't know that it was talking in

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,350
different language

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:28,920
right and so this put the orbiter into a

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:31,380
lower orbit and it was lost okay

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,820
so now the mission is radically

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,570
different right and we need to learn

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,460
from this

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:44,160
so metadata matters communication is

00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:48,050
difficult and meaning changes this was

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:53,040
the only image acquired by the orbiter

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:56,370
right I see some giggling so September 7

00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:02,790
1999 this picture was taken what does it

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:09,180
mean who would I ask will it ever mean

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:11,070
something else it won't mean anything if

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,740
I don't give you context if I didn't

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,440
tell you anything about the MCO this

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:22,920
would not have any significance to you

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,750
it's a smudge in a void okay and so this

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,350
is gonna mean very different things to

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:30,900
people throughout history now so this is

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:34,220
a failure it's also an amazing

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:38,010
achievement when you think about it so

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,020
what is this how do we make sure people

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:43,110
can learn from it this isn't something

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,120
that I can objectively define and say

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,020
this is what this image means it's going

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,780
to mean different things to different

00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,970
people and we need to make sure that the

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,980
types of questions that we know people

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,930
are going to ask we give them the

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,110
capacity to ask those things and find

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,060
answers and as new meeting is needed we

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,760
need to be able to attach that meaning

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,470
to these objects because we can't

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,000
anticipate all the questions people will

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:11,100
ask so that's where metadata comes in

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,560
metadata is structural it's descriptive

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,540
it's administrative it's all the things

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,710
that you don't necessarily understand

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,050
that you're interacting with all the

00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:23,070
time when you ask Google a dumb question

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:25,110
it will still give you a good answer you

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,500
can ask Google who the king of the

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:32,190
United States is and it will tell you

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,820
who the president is why is that it's

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,570
not magic

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,250
it's that people have defined

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:42,520
relationships between all of these

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,980
signifiers put them into a lexicon that

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,310
then at Google's appliance can crawl

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,650
through it's the knowledge graph so when

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,970
we say the united states and we say is

00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,990
we know that we're not talking about in

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,810
the past you know we're talking about

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,060
today because someone has said that's

00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:01,840
what is means we know the united states

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:04,870
we know that king is an invalid operand

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,120
there however we do know that the king

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:10,180
implies the form of governance but we

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,840
are not a monarchy so we can look up in

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:16,020
our lexicon what is the valid governance

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,990
structure and who is the sovereign

00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:21,100
equivalent in the United States so we're

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,720
going to get a good answer it's gonna

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,790
like automatically pop up and the thing

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,600
that it's going to use to pull that

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,950
information is probably wiki data

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,360
because that's the stuff that's indexed

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,660
most highly because that's what most

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,130
people contribute to but that's people

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,260
going in and editing Wikipedia and

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:43,600
adding new meanings to stuff nothing

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:46,030
about this is magical and when we want

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,760
to operationalize the thing that we want

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,700
to be able to search through we take all

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,530
of those elements in our lexicon all of

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,900
those signifiers and we map them

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,790
structurally into a framework that is

00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,610
called a schema this is where stuff is

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:03,070
recorded and so when I say I want to

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:06,550
make a metadata schema for satellite

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:09,670
missions I want to create that structure

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:12,370
that then has all of the meaning implied

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,930
in it operationally defined so other

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,750
people can crawl through it and we can

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:20,320
add new signifiers as they come so think

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:23,260
of this like a recipe card and if your

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,480
recipe right now you don't need to know

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:29,020
what kind of oven you need to make your

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,880
food great there's no element for that

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,320
but later you might need it so there

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,710
should totally be a way to add that

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,180
field right and if the thing that I'm

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,200
studying is not the food and I don't

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,270
want to make the food and I want to know

00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,080
the country that the food's origins are

00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,310
from does my template have that so we

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,500
don't know what kinds of questions

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:51,340
people will ask so we need to create

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,850
logical framework that is extensible so

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,730
here's another image so everything that

00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:01,180
is the only thing of something was the

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:03,160
first thing at some point so this is a

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,570
image I have in my collection it's great

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,080
it's beautiful it's gorgeous little

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:12,160
thing jeez it's the earliest image ever

00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,760
taken of the moon so for a little while

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:20,230
this was the only image of the moon so

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:23,680
this was taken by Samuel Humphrey it was

00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,870
a technological innovation that started

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,710
a revolution this blew people's minds

00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:31,660
you can take photos so this is a

00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:34,660
daguerreotype actually and it's an

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,370
experiment so you can see if you squint

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,170
I'm sorry those of you who might not be

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,560
able to see this well my slides are

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:43,570
online but essentially there's timing

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,150
written down the side of the stig arrow

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,590
type this was an experiment this is the

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,950
first time they're trying to capture a

00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:53,710
crisp image using a daguerreotype Inge

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,780
as a medium so this is an incredibly

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:59,410
noxious process you basically have to

00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:02,730
hold your silver over a vat of boiling

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:08,770
boiling mercury to expose your image

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:12,069
people died because of the need to make

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,660
images like this this is a radical

00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,870
revolution when you think about what

00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,850
photography has given us now it's art

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,699
though I loaned this this summer to the

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:24,270
Met Museum because it's the 50th

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:28,300
anniversary of the moon landing I

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:32,130
shipped this with an art dealer the

00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:34,990
meaning of things changes dramatically

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:41,140
these are Galileo's notes I also have

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:44,920
these so it's chicken scratch total

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:47,770
scribbles now they're priceless objects

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,450
though at the time he did not know but

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,640
he's basically the father of

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,410
observational astronomy and his notes

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,410
are seen as the origin of the scientific

00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:59,200
method although his work was done way

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,750
later than Copernicus his work like 60

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,870
some odd years

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:06,179
his is the stuff that got burned he's

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,919
the one who got in prison for life and

00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,380
it's because he took notes because other

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,600
people could replicate what he did and

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,890
he was teaching people how Copernicus

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,330
wrote a book in a time when almost

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:20,039
everyone was illiterate and he didn't

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:25,770
say how he got his answers so meaning

00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:28,440
changes so essentially meaning is just

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,990
collective agreement about something at

00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,610
a particular time we just decide as a

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:38,130
height line that this is what we agree

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:41,700
on but it means it's not static and so

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:44,100
you can't rely anymore on human readable

00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:48,780
metadata to scale so this is my little

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:51,360
image this is it on my desk and this is

00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:54,270
a search I just search for Humphrey the

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,409
person who took it and I came up with

00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,030
two things

00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:58,799
so not just this view of the moon

00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,890
multiple exposures beautiful little

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,140
object but he was also the person who

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:07,530
started the first photography journal

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:10,309
ever so the daguerreian journal and I

00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:13,340
didn't have to know that to find that

00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:15,990
because that's how many data works and

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,780
the more that we rely on moving away

00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,850
from these physical objects and I'm not

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,950
the steward people are not giving me

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,750
their things to be curated anymore I

00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,250
can't answer someone's question to say

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,370
is this on my desk or in a vault right

00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:32,520
now I can't do that with all things and

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:35,190
we're never going to be able to again so

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,530
we need a machine actionable metadata

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,450
because signifiers mean different things

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,390
to different people so if i zoom in here

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,280
I don't know if I can zoom any further

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:50,309
but basically there's a line up there

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:52,280
that says dimensions : sixth plate so in

00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:58,049
the land of the history of photography

00:19:52,280 --> 00:20:00,179
sixth plate is a dimension but that

00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:06,150
doesn't mean anything to you if you are

00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:07,559
not in this context right and so we also

00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,600
have interestingly here I want to point

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,419
out but it's hard to read basically

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,750
there's two fields one for the journal

00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,510
and

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:18,060
one for my daguerreotype they both say

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,800
altar creator and they both list this

00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,840
person Humphrey but they list him very

00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,030
differently so in one case he's the

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,320
photographer and another he's Humphrey

00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:32,130
comma SD Samuel Dwight and then it lists

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,650
his birthday which is a little odd when

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:37,230
you think about it but that's what it is

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,610
and because we can't have absolute

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,970
agreement on things and I want to be

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,890
able to find out that Humphrey was also

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,790
the founder of this journal and not just

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,810
the the photographer in this image I

00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,250
want to be able to find that out without

00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,430
having to have everyone agree with me

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:56,310
right so what we do is we crosswalk so

00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:58,740
in metadata terms crosswalking is

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:01,860
basically the translation from one

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,320
lexicon to another you wanted to say

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,200
this person's name this way and then we

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,120
come up with machine actionable tools to

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,890
make it so you can say I mean the same

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,000
thing that you mean but I'm not using

00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:17,130
this term the same way you are so

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,640
schema.org elements like I never I'm

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:23,190
gonna describe what author is right as a

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,950
term I'm just gonna map to someone

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:32,160
else's really good definition of it and

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:35,550
so we need to prevent mission failure we

00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,350
need to do better and we need things to

00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,060
be a machine actionable so these are

00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,850
just like little snapshots from

00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:44,210
Wikipedia where you can see essentially

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,530
the Mars climate orbiter orbiter was

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:51,300
before called the Mars survivor

00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:53,400
Survey or 98 orbiter I've got the Mars

00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,070
Observer as another alternate name for

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,600
it and we have a description of an

00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,720
instrument called the pressure modulator

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,930
infrared radiometer but it's also the

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,640
PMI are our dimensions means something

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,340
radically different in this context

00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:12,420
because six the plate would be nonsense

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:14,010
and we also just have typos so when you

00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,930
look at spacecraft week this is from the

00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:22,560
official report it's missing an S on

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:25,340
pound pounds so we need to make this US

00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,340
proof

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,670
so what is a mission why is there a

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,940
mission

00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:39,309
who takes a mission on I would like to

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,190
live in a world where we have the

00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,610
capacity to learn from each other

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:49,150
without having to agree with each other

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:50,710
and I would like to be able to add new

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,620
meaning to things because all of these

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:55,570
things are going to be history by nature

00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,549
of being in this room you are doing

00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:59,679
something interesting and different and

00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:03,850
new that the world will see very

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:06,429
differently later and so I want to be

00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:09,429
able to describe the pieces the hardware

00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:13,650
the data the people the software and I

00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:17,679
want to put that together with you so

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:19,600
we're starting to do that we have a

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,000
couple of very constrained use cases

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,950
we're really just getting started with

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:31,360
this but you can essentially participate

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:33,580
in this thought experiment so you have a

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,500
couple of implementation cases and we

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,690
certainly have not gone thrown the crazy

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:41,230
rabbit hole that I know we will be on in

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:44,440
the next six to eight months but I can't

00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:47,290
pick when the conferences so if you go

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,059
to schema dot space there are a couple

00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:52,270
of different ways that you can

00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:54,790
contribute your ideas to how I might

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:56,620
describe a space mission because some of

00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:59,890
the things that you're doing might come

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,169
up in those contacts the first thing you

00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,240
can do is you can go to get lab and just

00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:07,210
make an issue and yell at me about how

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,150
I'm wrong about something I'd appreciate

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:14,110
if you did that kindly you're allowed to

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:15,700
be loud though and the other thing we

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:19,299
have is this thing we're calling our

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,429
sorting tool because most of the time

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:24,340
you won't know you're interacting with

00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:26,380
metadata and I don't expect you to so

00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,120
this is not your job and it never has

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,790
been but we're operating in a new world

00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,710
guys and so you have to care for us to

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,660
be able to do this accurately there's

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,210
all sorts of problems right now and how

00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,500
we define everything and the more input

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,020
and the more diverse

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,140
effectives you can get in these contexts

00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,630
the less bias you engrain and everything

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:50,260
you're trying to do

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:53,520
so I guess my take-home message is

00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:58,300
metadata is not neutral

00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:03,160
please don't let people define what

00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:07,570
everything means about you your

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:11,200
contribution matters a lot so with my

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:13,990
last couple of minutes then I figured

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,950
what I could do is at the very least

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:19,660
maybe show you how this thing works cuz

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:25,380
essentially all I want you to be able to

00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:28,470
do is pick like mission click expand all

00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,940
you can see what we're thinking about

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,790
you can tell me I'm wrong by basically

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:37,810
saying something like I think orbital

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:45,150
parameters should be part of mission

00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:50,590
service category you're missing coms

00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:53,130
adds a node goes up here you don't have

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,360
the thing that I want so imma put it

00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,750
with people because I think there should

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,670
be comms people I think that mission

00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:06,910
description is dumb so I'm going to put

00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:09,700
it over at orphans it's pretty easy to

00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:12,340
play around with me with us and if you

00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,960
click show feedback form you can enter

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,950
your name you can tell me a message

00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,500
confirm for me that you're not a robot

00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,930
and this will send me a JSON file with

00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,630
all of your ideas so that we can discuss

00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:28,270
them then on get lab and incorporate

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,790
them into changes we want to make but

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:34,210
this is not the kind of thing that will

00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:36,270
result in some absolute understanding of

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:39,490
what a mission is because it can't

00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:42,460
metadata needs to evolve just like any

00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:45,190
other lexicon does and so I would

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:48,580
appreciate your contributions now as we

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:51,650
get started but later as you come across

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,530
anyone else who you think might

00:26:51,650 --> 00:27:04,790
I have something to say so thank you for

00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:06,140
your time okay we have a couple minutes

00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:09,050
for questions if anybody in the audience

00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,840
has questions most of the times did you

00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:14,360
do a lexicon and these sort of things

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:19,450
they're absolute at least and some sort

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,450
of version what if you have competing

00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:26,840
fields that need to be merged setter or

00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:29,270
there are uncertainties or your of

00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,340
course your universe is always open but

00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,840
eventually you've got to close it to do

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,809
something with it how are you going to

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,760
deal with the probability or the

00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:40,880
uncertainty and some of those those

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,500
values yeah so one of the things that

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,210
we're doing right now is establishing a

00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,809
much more clear governance structure so

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:49,910
the idea would be that as we do a stable

00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:52,730
release so at a certain point you

00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,620
aggregate it up enough changes that you

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,120
all kind of have consensus about that

00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,460
you think can be the foundation of where

00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,679
you go next you release a stable version

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,290
of your schema and then we also have

00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,900
what we're calling our stage releases so

00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:08,059
as we're making changes and committing

00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,580
to them those will be incorporated into

00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:12,620
the diagram that you see but those will

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,050
not yet be bundled into a new stable

00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,400
release so those will be for constant

00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,110
discussion and the other thing about

00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,440
agreement because we don't need

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:25,429
agreement is nothing precludes you from

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:30,710
changing this schemas as opposed to

00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:32,600
standards are optional they are guidance

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,970
you implement this how you want it's

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,350
meant to be a tool for others we're not

00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,320
saying that you need to be compliant

00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:41,480
with anything and if you decide that you

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,600
want to use a different kind of units

00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,520
but your thing means the same thing

00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,200
ideally we just have a field where you

00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,580
can define the units that you're using

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:56,120
and if your way of describing something

00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:58,070
like Humphrey my photographer you want

00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,020
to use a different standard to describe

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,900
who he is all we're gonna have is

00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,070
something called LD sojung json linked

00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,430
data we'll be able to refer to

00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:11,820
externally defined standards so it's all

00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:13,410
about identifiers so identifying a

00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,320
spacecraft there's a lot of different

00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:20,640
ways you could do that crossbar ID NORAD

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,350
ID qubit I'm not going to tell you which

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,180
one of those is right I'm going to tell

00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:26,490
you which one of those we recommend the

00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,440
way that you should write it and if you

00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,360
choose not to the other options you have

00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,370
available to yourself and how you would

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,370
define that option within the schema

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:41,070
fully open yeah so right now we're doing

00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:44,580
everything developing it fully in the

00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:47,370
open and happy to answer questions about

00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,110
it but this is not a standard it's more

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,480
in library science what we call

00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:55,260
authority control so it's a reference

00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,820
point that you can build off of yeah so

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,280
the question is about the concept of

00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:02,190
time and how you incorporate time and

00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,190
the evolution of a term into your

00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:07,380
construction is that correct okay so one

00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:09,240
example of how we do this might be

00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,940
useful in the unified astronomy

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,290
thesaurus which is the vocabulary that I

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,980
refer to at the beginning that I'm

00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:21,120
helping build and so we have the concept

00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,640
of depreciation so depreciation of terms

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,020
or how you might classify something

00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,290
Pluto is a good example

00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:30,120
so Pluto is now a dwarf planet it is the

00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:33,300
king of the Kuiper belt but it was a

00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,100
planet right so we have Pluto does not

00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,470
change the object but the signifiers

00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,050
that we use to define it have changed

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,610
and so we depreciate the previous

00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:44,490
definition and where it's at in our

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:47,910
hierarchy we used to put Pluto squarely

00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:49,950
in the planets category we created a new

00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:52,670
subcategory now so the nesting is

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:56,370
different and so we depreciate that use

00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:58,740
but it's an alternate use so it's not

00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:02,760
invalid it is just not the preferred

00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:04,650
term in this context and so this is used

00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,750
a lot in searching for like medical

00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:10,410
context if you wanted to call something

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:11,700
a myocardial infarction or versus a

00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,140
heart attack and you wanted to be able

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,160
to search for all of those things but

00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,500
you want to look for them in different

00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,150
contexts some of the ways that you're

00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,049
looking for that thing might not be

00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,519
valid anymore but

00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:22,049
you should still be able to find it so

00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:27,299
it's about depreciating us showing up

00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:29,610
terms and with that we're out of time so

00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,010
let's thank Dana thank you very much for

00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:34,849
being here

00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:34,849
