	00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,360
so been asked how I'd like to be

00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,950
introduced I said you know you could

00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,170
mention that you know I got my

00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,750
undergraduate degree from MIT in

00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,360
aerospace engineering and then my PhD

00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,130
and then went to work for NASA and then

00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,980
I had to break it to him that was all BS

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,829
no no that was true the truth is a

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,270
little less amazing I I was fortunate to

00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:43,570
have been born here in Huntsville I

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:47,260
about the same time that the space huh

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:53,200
there we go about the same time that the

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,820
space that NASA was founded and and so

00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,800
then after graduating from Grissom high

00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,390
school that's was named after Gus

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:05,650
Grissom who course perished in the

00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:07,350
Apollo one fire I went to the University

00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:11,229
of Alabama

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,350
there and there we go that's better

00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:17,680
and got a business degree from Alabama

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:21,520
then started a career in advocacy and

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,790
public policy I went to work for the

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,210
chamber in 1991 and I do some kind of

00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:31,000
hybrid version of government affairs and

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,280
economic development my dad was the

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,010
first space reporter to work for the

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,670
Huntsville Times and so he started there

00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:45,180
and in the late 50s and went on to write

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:47,860
a couple of books about space and and

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,420
and then most of which were funny

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,640
stories about collections of funny

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,520
stories about the space program but he

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,490
did write a very very serious biography

00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:01,990
of Wernher von Braun a title doctor

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:05,409
space so Steve who's helped organize the

00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,090
conference kind of framed what do you

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,739
like for me to talk about today and that

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,750
is you know Huntsville's connection to

00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:12,939
the space industry is is kind of deep

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,200
and enduring but but you know what did

00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:16,060
the future hold for Huntsville and

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,090
there's kind of some I guess expectation

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,610
about you know certainly challenges that

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,340
exist so let's start with a little

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,010
background on on Huntsville and our role

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,650
with space exploration

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:34,340
first off our nickname the rocket city

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,440
it was May the 13th of 1953 when the

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,930
husband Times reported that the Chamber

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,180
of Commerce was releasing a new map and

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,740
brochure about the city declaring the

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,470
nickname of the city would be the Rocket

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,150
City previously we've been known as the

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:53,600
as the water crest capital of the world

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:55,520
so this was kind of a big step up as I

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,970
mentioned I grew up in Huntsville in the

00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,310
1960s and as the crow flies my home was

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,740
about ten miles from where the test

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,960
stands are located where the where the

00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,270
Saturn five rocket was being tested you

00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,760
know I felt the ground shake as they

00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,960
were testing those engines that would

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,960
eventually take us to the moon

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:19,000
so that rocket was designed and

00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:23,360
developed here by dr. Wernher von Braun

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,390
his team had moved here in 1950 from

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,430
Fort Bliss Texas where they had located

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,440
immediately after World War two and they

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,800
were put on Redstone Arsenal which was

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,290
the site of an abandoned chemical Corps

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,959
operation it was kind of a remote

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:42,860
location there was really big 40,000

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,120
acres and but it it had kind of most

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,570
importantly in addition to a lot of

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,400
space and some relatively new facilities

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,780
access to river transportation which you

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,680
were gonna need if you're going to be

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,180
building really big stuff like Rockets

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,270
so that was the home of the Army's

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,180
ballistic missile agency and in addition

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,130
to developing the Army's missiles this

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,130
team also built the Redstone and the

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,459
Jupiter sea that was the rocket that the

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:13,489
u.s. used in 1958 to respond to the

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,920
Sputnik launch and you see a picture of

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:22,160
it there on the right that same vehicle

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,720
was used in 1961 and you see it on the

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,300
far left is to kind of put it into some

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,790
context to launch Alan Shepard into

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,130
space although it was a sub orbital trip

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:34,789
of course that was after the Russians

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:38,690
had launched Yuri Gagarin in 1961 by

00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:40,070
1958 dr. von Braun and his team had

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,700
started working on the saturn v

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:46,610
rockets or the Saturn Rockets in 1960

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,030
dr. von Braun and 4,000 of his fellow

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,130
army employees traded their NASA badges

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,900
traded their army badges for NASA badges

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,810
and the Marshall Space Flight Center was

00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,620
born there as a nineteen hundred acre

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:03,920
Enclave on Redstone Arsenal 40,000 acres

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,350
Redstone Arsenal so so redstone

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,850
continues its role in in the Army's

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,160
missile development and missile defense

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,020
although there's a whole lot more that

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,270
goes on on the Arsenal besides just

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,830
missiles and missile defense so for the

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,600
Apollo missions Huntsville was Laurie

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,060
was responsible largely for the

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,240
development of the launch vehicle itself

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,490
so that includes everything except for

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,440
the the capsule and the and the lander

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,690
so that includes things like the fuel

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,110
tank guidance and control systems

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:39,110
engines controllers after Apollo

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,880
Huntsville developed the sky lab which

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,910
was the first space station we launched

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,380
in the 70s and and then the space

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,210
shuttle and of course I work on the

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,590
shuttle included the same things that we

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,540
kind of done for the Saturn vehicle

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,030
which was fuel tanks and engines and

00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:56,420
boosters we also developed and

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,130
manufactured all of the US components

00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,140
for the International Space Station were

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,660
fabricated at the Marshall Space Flight

00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,420
Center we currently manage all the

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,300
science that's done on the International

00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,100
Space Station so as it's up there

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,890
orbiting the Earth so now we're going to

00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,410
do a quick lesson in gravity and orbital

00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,620
mechanics I appreciate that this group

00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,840
is smarter than the average bear but I

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,600
want to pose a quick question just to

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,700
make sure we're on the same page so

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,190
right now the space station is orbiting

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:34,220
earth at an altitude of about 250 miles

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:40,430
so how strong is gravity at 250 miles

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:43,100
versus here on earth anybody go almost

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,900
exactly the same so it's 97 98 percent

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,150
so the only reason that the space

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,000
station doesn't fall to the earth like a

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,569
rock is the fact that it's going really

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,270
fast so it's going 17,000 miles

00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:57,399
our so it's in a constant state of free

00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,319
fall so it's falling just it's moving

00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,199
just fast enough to keep it from

00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:08,379
plummeting to earth and not so fast that

00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:12,369
it spins out into some other orbit so so

00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:14,830
now you know to get out of low Earth

00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:16,479
orbit and to get out of Earth's

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,439
gravitational pull you have to

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,830
accelerate to about 25,000 miles an hour

00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:26,830
so to lift a mass necessary to carry

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:30,279
people and stuff to go to the moon you

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,569
need a really big rocket so now using

00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,459
our new knowledge about orbital

00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:35,229
mechanics we're going to take a look at

00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:39,069
what's going on in space at these

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:43,300
various different altitudes so space

00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:45,339
begins at about a hundred miles the

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,949
atmosphere is really thin and you know

00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:52,029
you get that dark blue you know image of

00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:54,999
space later this year versus still a

00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:56,589
thin atmosphere up there but but that's

00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:59,229
that's kind of where officially space

00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:01,749
begins later this year or early next

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,959
year we'll see the first commercial

00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:07,029
suborbital tourist launches by Blue

00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,519
Origin and Virgin Galactic on their new

00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:11,499
Shepard and the spaceship two vehicles

00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,669
so those those Rockets are not going to

00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:14,860
get into orbit they're just going to go

00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,569
up to the edge of space and the

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,189
passengers will get about five minutes

00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,899
of weightlessness you know you're

00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:22,389
weightless from the time that something

00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:25,119
stops pushing you up until the time

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,949
something starts slowing you down so

00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:30,129
it's going to be about five minutes give

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:32,740
or take the next step above that of

00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:35,759
course up at that leo at two hundred and

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,560
fifty miles is low-earth orbit

00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,740
there's a really robust commercial

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,060
market you know to be a you know from

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,500
250 miles up to a few thousand miles up

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:51,610
all the way up to geosynchronous orbit

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:54,550
from those places you can you can

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,350
observe the weather a whole host of

00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,939
other conditions you know fires and

00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,240
stuff like that we can triangulate our

00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:03,819
position with GPS transmit voice obvious

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,450
video signals by satellite and observe

00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:07,959
heavenly

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,329
these with Space Telescope's NASA is

00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,760
slowly moving its human space

00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:14,950
exploration program out of low Earth

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,070
orbit and they're really trying to move

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:23,050
more toward deep space so deep space

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:24,699
lies beyond all of these orbits and for

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,949
the foreseeable future it's really kind

00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:29,350
of the purview of governments deep space

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:30,880
is not a viable there there isn't a

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,480
really viable commercial market at this

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,449
moment and until we can identify some

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,180
way for meaning meaningful commercial

00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:43,690
opportunities I don't anticipate a big

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,610
rush to deep space so now that we

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,550
understand the difference between

00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,930
suborbital leo geo and deep space let's

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,120
talk about what's going on at Huntsville

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:57,550
and we'll start by talking about rockets

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,470
so today we're developing the the SLS

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,449
rocket that's the space launch system

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:05,680
that's pictured on either side of the

00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:07,540
Saturn in different variants it's again

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,699
so it's roughly the same size as the

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:14,199
Saturn vehicle so it's been kind of a

00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:17,740
thrill to watch a lot of this hardware

00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:20,410
get developed over the years and I've

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,269
had a chance to go to the Masoud to see

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,160
some parts of it manufactured some of it

00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:27,399
was manufactured here on the far right

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,199
you can see a picture of the the heat of

00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,060
the hydrogen stage of that core stage

00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:32,410
rocket in the test and that's out at the

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,600
Marshall Space Flight Center so that's

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,029
being tested right now even as we spent

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,699
even as we speak

00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:43,540
the so testing will begin on the core

00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:46,420
stage next year this is a picture of a

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,100
core stage simulator and just to kind of

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,050
put it into perspective that's me

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,790
standing at the end of that core stage

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,110
simulator that was also made in Alabama

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:57,190
and the picture on the left shows it

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,779
being positioned at the Stennis Space

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,850
Center where they're going to just

00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,440
practice handling this big thing so once

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,959
they get used to handling its Dennis

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,839
it's gonna that simulator will move to

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,639
the Kennedy Space Center in order to let

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,050
them practice moving that big thing

00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,050
around so

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:20,730
SLS is the only launch system that's in

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:24,300
development now that can lift the Orion

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:28,320
space capsule and a lander on a lunar

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,670
mission so just to be clear because you

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,560
know as often you know some

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,800
misunderstandings about you know who can

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:39,510
do what Elon Musk does not have a rocket

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:43,050
that can take the the the capsule that

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:47,100
we're developing right now and the Orion

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:50,399
space capsule and put it into a cyst

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,110
lunar around the moon environment this

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,000
chart kind of shows the relative lift

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,970
capabilities for a mission to the moon

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,760
and a mission to Mars and if you want to

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,190
get that capsule that was designed to

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,339
take people to the moon into Mars to the

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:12,480
moon you're gonna have to have the SLS

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:15,300
so the so there's really not a

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,120
commercial market at the moment for for

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,339
deep space exploration

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,320
NASA is hoping that other people are

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,170
going to develop some capabilities to

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,000
take stuff to the moon into that

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,779
environment and I'm sure if they pay

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,240
them enough money they will but but

00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:35,580
beyond that I'm not really sure I was at

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,560
a conference last week and there was a

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,630
presentation on commercial lunar

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,130
activities and they got gave a great

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,930
presentation showing the vehicles

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,330
something and I asked him I said so so

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:48,600
we were your customers who's paying you

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:51,240
you know to go to the moon and he said

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,370
well Mexico and then I'm like okay

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,770
that's not really commercial but you

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,420
know and then he said well you know a

00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,010
time capsule so I was like oh well

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,450
that's you know certainly it's gonna be

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:04,740
a rush for our time capsules to put

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:06,120
stuff on there so I anticipate SLS is

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,000
going to be a really important part of

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,730
our you know our future space

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,670
architecture for many many years to come

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:17,279
so besides SLS now is Huntsville

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,020
contributing to space launch and space

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,920
exploration

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:24,980
so United Launch Alliance ula currently

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,959
manufactures the Delta and

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,230
those rockets that shown in the blue

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,089
boxes on this chart at the Decatur

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,519
facility that's just a few miles from

00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,680
here so so Atlas and Delta Rockets are

00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,260
being manufactured there and they've

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,139
started work actually it was out there

00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,240
not too long ago and they've got parts

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:46,790
for the new Vulcan rocket that's shown

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,139
in the red box so that's the rocket

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,800
that's going to replace the Atlas and

00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:54,110
Delta Rockets and of course Atlas and

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,870
Delta were the primary means of getting

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,339
stuff into space before Elon Musk and

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:03,260
SpaceX got into the act

00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:06,139
Blue Origin is manufacturing or will be

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:09,290
manufacturing their engines the B III of

00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:12,130
b4 engines for their new Glenn rockets

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:15,949
and those are shown in the yellow boxes

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,329
on the charts there so those engines are

00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:19,519
going to be built here and they're going

00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:23,209
to be tested at the Marshall Space

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,889
Flight Center in the old f1 engine test

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,860
and that was the engine that was used to

00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:31,370
take us to the moon so those engines are

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:36,550
going to be used both by ula and I mean

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:39,589
by Blue Origin and ula so air jet

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:42,980
Rocketdyne recently relocated their

00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:45,170
advanced manufacturing center north of

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:49,040
Huntsville next to the torque Toyota

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,600
engine manufacturing facility and that's

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,430
where the Aerojet Rocketdyne is going to

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,730
be producing 3d printed components and

00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:58,160
all their advanced composite structures

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,230
local startup Dianetics also has a firm

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,740
toehold in the space industry and in

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:05,660
defense industry on the SLS program

00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,060
Dianetics has delivered the stage launch

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,339
the the vehicle stage adapter so that's

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,620
the connector point between the the core

00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:14,149
stage and the upper stages Lockheed

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,610
Martin and Boeing course have a large

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,889
and growing footprint here supporting

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,839
NASA and a lot of defense activities and

00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:23,540
there are a host of other manufacturers

00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,250
here who supply components to the launch

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,920
industry so tell van Brown a brown

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:31,519
precision and GE has opened up a new

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,980
ceramic matrix composite teak production

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,260
facility RUAG manufactures huge

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,880
composite structures fairings for

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,170
rockets here

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,970
but the space industry is not just

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,100
launched it's obviously what you do

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,630
while you're in space and then how how

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,120
you use that data when you get back to

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,950
earth Marshall the Marshall Space Flight

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,010
Center is going to continue to have an

00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:57,400
important role in space exploration too

00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:00,250
so Marshall will manage the lunar lander

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,170
program so so the vehicle is actually

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,339
going to descend to the lunar surface is

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,380
going to be managed at the Marshall

00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:07,930
Space Flight Center that's going to be

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,720
used on the artemis 3 mission so there's

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,760
Artemis one that's coming up in 2021 and

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,200
then a year or so after that they're

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,190
going to put a crew on that vehicle

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,290
they're going to take it to the moon

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,960
they're not going to land but in 2024

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:23,140
they're planning to actually land people

00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,330
on the on the lunar surface and Marshall

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:28,029
is probably going to have some other

00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:30,640
responsibilities for various parts of

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,080
the lunar mission right now as I

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,940
mentioned before Marshall Space Flight

00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,770
Center manages all the payload

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,270
operations all the science that's done

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,900
on the International Space Station is

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:44,320
managed by the Marshall Space Flight

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,810
Center and Marshall also does all the

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,000
advanced manufacturing materials and

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:53,860
research and development activities so

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,390
NASA also of course I mentioned earlier

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,010
all the science being done on the

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,130
station is being managed by the Marshall

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,080
Space Flight Center Boeing manages the

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,880
Eclipse which is the life support system

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,000
on the space station that's reclaiming

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,679
all the all the water on the system

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,390
they're just upgrading it right now it's

00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:14,980
about 80% 85% efficient they've just got

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:18,579
a new upgrade they're going to go to

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:21,520
about 98% efficiency in the reclamation

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:24,970
of water and that core system course

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,390
makes oxygen also for the for the for

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:30,340
the astronauts up there so so what do

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,230
you do with the data and the material

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:38,260
that you that you gather while you're in

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:41,470
space the so early in Huntsville mayor

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:44,140
tommy battles first term he's now well

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,820
into his third term he initiated three

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,850
technology incubation efforts around

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,610
cyber around power and geospatial

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,380
technologies I think in a long time

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,110
all those initiatives are going to kind

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,549
of reinforce our space footprint there's

00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,320
a host of other smaller companies

00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:03,580
involved in space vehicles that

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:07,390
satellite uses I won't go through all

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,010
those right now but this is kind of the

00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,880
most interesting play that the community

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:15,059
is making Sierra Nevada has been awarded

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,530
a contract to resupply the space station

00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:22,179
with cargo using its Dream Chaser

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,370
vehicle slightly different from this but

00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:26,679
you get the idea so it looks a lot like

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,260
a space shuttle except for terrifically

00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,179
smaller Huntsville is the only community

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,540
that's currently pursuing a license to

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:38,140
land the the dreamchaser space vehicle

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:40,929
at general aviation a Airport and we we

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,419
hope and expect to have a mission to

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:48,040
land here I hope y'all will come back

00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:50,970
for that to see this thing land so but I

00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,080
hope you see that Huntsville you know

00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,820
even though the space industry is

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,380
growing up all around us and it's a lot

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,100
more diverse than it once was it's no

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,510
longer this monolith of NASA Huntsville

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,940
continues to have a bright future I

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,980
think in space a space exploration and

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,440
so we don't really intend to relinquish

00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,970
the Rocket City title anytime soon so I

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,130
appreciate the opportunity to come and

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,320
talk with you today and I've

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,000
intentionally reserved a little time for

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,890
for questions and answers if you all

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,890
have any that I might be able to handle

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,720
