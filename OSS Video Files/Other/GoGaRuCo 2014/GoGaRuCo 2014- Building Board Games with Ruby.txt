Description: 
	By, Yonatan Bergman
Board games are seeing a huge resurgence right now, everywhere you look people are playing new games. The Internet and crowd funding has made it possible for almost anyone to design and develop a physical board game.

Join me while I share the story of how I used Ruby to design my first board game. How I honed the game mechanics and optimized all the different moving parts. You will leave this talk knowing the process of designing and developing a board game from scratch and how Ruby can help you iterate fast on new ideas using simple code, simulations and some statistics.

hi everyone so as Jim said my name is

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,580
Jonathan Bergman and Hum here to share

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,730
the story of how I build a board game

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,500
and how Ruby latest it at all now I'm

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,619
not going to talk about digital board

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,559
games with actual physical board games

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:37,530
so I hope you enjoy the talk so I'm a

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:42,629
tech lead at the ebay Israel Innovation

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,570
Center down in Tel Aviv and we build

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:49,710
cool projects for ebay mostly using Ruby

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,020
on Rails and I wanted to not click that

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,390
button but I wanted to start off with a

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,129
short intro to board gaming because I'm

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,739
guessing that when i say board games

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:03,210
some of you think of this or maybe this

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:06,030
but board games have changed a lot in

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,159
the past 20 years i want to have a quick

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:13,740
show of hands who here has played a

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:20,549
board game in the past year whoa for the

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:23,610
past month not bad today so there's a

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,770
current revival of board gaming as a

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,829
hobby and more and more people play

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,409
board games each year now Mardan games

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,750
also have a very wide variety of both

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,409
mechanics and themes available to them

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,630
from settlers of catan which was

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,939
considered the grandfather of designer

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,619
games it's a game where you raised to

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,479
settle an island competing with the

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,740
other players for resources but never

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,930
actually fighting them carcassonne a

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,990
tile laying game where you have to build

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,850
a medieval city in France and ticket to

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,450
ride which is a set collection game

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,479
where you lay railway tracks across the

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,899
u.s. and try to block off your opponents

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,910
to lesser-known games like agricola a

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,310
worker placement game where you build a

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,870
farm and harvest food and try to make

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,350
sure that your family doesn't starve

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,260
over with

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,030
winter galaxy trucker which is a really

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,280
crazy game where you build a spaceship

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,530
using only one hand fly through space

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,720
and get it then you get a seed get

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,840
pulverized by meteors and aliens and

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,640
pirates and so forth and the resistance

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,740
which is one of my favorites a social

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,690
deduction game with no physical parts at

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,790
all where you just accuse your friends

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,470
all the time for being spies all the

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,780
while hiding the fact that you were one

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,580
all along so there are many other

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,530
examples of Awesome board games right

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,450
now but all of them have in common that

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,650
they bring people together around the

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,240
table now board gaming as a medium is

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,420
unparalleled than the way that it has

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:58,140
both a competitive gaming aspect as very

00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:01,010
social interactions we're now in a

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,020
golden age of board gaming as people say

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,480
since 99 sales have been growing at a

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,820
rate of ten to twenty percent each year

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,330
with the amount of games published

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,070
growing accordingly from around 500

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,900
games published in the year two thousand

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,880
two more than a thousand you board games

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,490
published last year that's a crazy

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,610
amount and a lot of copy pasting to get

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,010
the graph there so let's talk about how

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,290
board games are made I'm going to

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,180
generalize the process it's not the same

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,390
for all the games out there but it

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,380
should get you an understanding on how

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,450
board games are made and what is

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,540
required to produce a barber game right

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,640
now so we start with a designer that's

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,710
the person who invents the game usually

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,530
the one whose name adorns the box when

00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:48,330
it's ready so they come up with a basic

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,100
mechanics and rules of the game they

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,410
iterate through the rules several

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,330
several different iterations and they

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,250
usually add a theme to the game whether

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,770
it's a farming game or racing game a

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,660
giant monster game or whatever they will

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,640
go through several iterations and have a

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,640
prototype ready to show the publisher

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,950
while a designer is usually one person

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,600
or a small group a publisher is usually

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,850
a bigger company that will help produce

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,590
the game the designer will show the

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,180
prototype around to several publisher

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,670
and get when interested in buying the

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,380
rights of the game then the publisher

00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,359
takes the game to its internal

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,070
development team now these are not

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,650
programmers even though they're called

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,340
developers but people who are in charge

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,669
of getting the game ready

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,050
the raw state so it's ready to print

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,060
they work with the artist and the

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,580
content writers on getting all the

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,919
assets ready they set the final game

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,600
rules in the final theme they might even

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,280
change it based on the other games that

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,220
the company's currently producing and

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,199
they do a lot of player testing during

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,479
that phase this is an iterative process

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,060
when they try to iron out all the bugs

00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,100
out of the game there are many different

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,810
ways to play us the gang right now open

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,330
closed play testing and even something

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,070
called blind play testing where you just

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,810
sent out a game to a group of people and

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,419
you don't help them at all and you just

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,070
get feedback at the end so after the

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:08,350
game is ready for print it's sent to the

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,020
manufacturer so let's talk about cost

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,720
for a second when producing a video game

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,340
or a nap usually the cost is in the

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,100
upfront when you're developing the game

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,990
or the app getting multiple copies out

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,479
there once you're done is relatively

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,700
cheap or even free but when you're

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,580
producing a board game each physical

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,340
copy that you produce has costs in both

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,780
materials production and shipping and

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,900
storage which is something that you

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,970
don't necessarily think about so you see

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,919
producing a board game is a complex

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,810
process involving many different people

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,479
and to get a game out there you need a

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,240
lot of help luckily things have been

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,250
improving over the past few years

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,740
Kickstarter the crowdfunding website has

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,530
been a real game-changer in the scene it

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,050
enables people to get their games out

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,870
there and fund them without needing to

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,060
find a publishing house for the past

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,830
four years the table top category and

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,320
Kickstarter has grown from a hundred

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,940
thousand dollars in 2010 to over 30

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,539
million collected for board game

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,550
campaigns this year which is crazy it is

00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,340
worth noting though that with so many

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,139
games now relying on Kickstarter to get

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,250
produced one out of every three

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:23,320
campaigns fails another cool way people

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,349
get games right now is using Trenton

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,419
play which is essentially open sourcing

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:31,180
board games people who come up with

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:32,979
games publish the rules and all the

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,409
necessary things you need to play the

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:37,330
game online and you as a person can just

00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:40,270
go online print out the parts whether

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,169
it's cards boards whatever and just play

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,300
the game

00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,800
this is widely used when doing play

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,139
testing because you don't always have

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,300
access to your testers so you can just

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,340
send them a PDF and expect them to print

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,430
out the rules and play the game which is

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,050
really really cool so this was just a

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,330
little taste of the board gaming ruled

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,639
right now it doesn't I didn't touch

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,889
everything out there but I hope you

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,590
could see that board games has a

00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,719
parallel to developing software which

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,699
was probably one of the reasons I was

00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:12,159
naturally drawn to building a board game

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,199
as a side project a couple of months ago

00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:16,479
I had an idea and I started designing my

00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,719
first board game which I call missiles

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,889
and microchips it's this one here

00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:23,259
missiles and microchips is a sort of

00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:25,270
cross between poker a game I used to

00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,039
play as kids called standoff we would

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,520
you point the gun fingers at each other

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,319
and some game theory mixed in in the

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,839
game you play a robe supercomputer

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,060
trying to take over the world but to do

00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,210
so you have to fight the other computers

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,639
out there each player starts the game

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,639
with five energy points which are both

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,469
your life and your score the object of

00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,159
the game is to be the first to reach ten

00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:53,199
points or the last player standing at

00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,449
the beginning of the round all the

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,599
players simultaneously select an action

00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:00,849
and a target from their hand everyone

00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,710
has the same available set of actions to

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,680
them and targets representing the other

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:08,469
players every one then reveals their

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,659
chosen target starting from the start

00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:13,240
there each player can change the hidden

00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:15,729
action that they chose but pay one

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,589
energy to do so but it's really great if

00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:19,149
you're trying to bluff someone out or if

00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:21,669
you see that everyone is ganging up on

00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:23,469
you players then reveal their chosen

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:27,189
action you can choose between three

00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:30,039
different actions attack if successful

00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:32,050
will remove one energy from your target

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,260
and disable any charge that they're

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:37,329
trying to do block protect you from

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,329
incoming attack hurting your attackers

00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:42,610
but it will cost you one if used when no

00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:45,220
one else is attacking you and charge

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,579
will add one energy to your pool a way

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,069
to heal yourself up now each action

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:53,170
interacts differently depending on who

00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:54,910
you're doing the target of action on

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,330
what their action is

00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,490
and who in turn they're targeting all in

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,800
all there's 18 different combinations

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,780
between two players and a given round

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,060
and when you combine that with the fact

00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,340
that everyone is playing simultaneously

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,850
it creates very interesting interactions

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:15,670
around the table so after resolving the

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,130
actions players update their energy if

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,950
someone won we stopped the game hooray

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,080
otherwise everyone takes their cards

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,600
back the starting player token moves and

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,700
we go through another round the game

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,460
continues like this until one person

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:33,880
reaches ten energy points or all players

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:36,010
but one are eliminated so those were the

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,360
basic rules of the game and now for the

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,560
interesting part I want to go through

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,230
how I got the rules so it all started

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,540
one day during lunch I was sitting with

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,610
one of my co-workers who's also into

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,740
board games and game design and I was

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,260
sharing the idea for the game I had with

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,690
him I told him I was having issues with

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,340
them deciding on how the actions

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,640
interact with one another and the

00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,410
specific numbers we talked about it and

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,980
we came up with the idea of writing a

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:08,380
simulator in Ruby so I went to work on

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,020
that first version that night the first

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,940
version was very very simple you would

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,730
just input how many players were playing

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,680
and I had all the basic building blocks

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,960
needed to simulate a game whether it's

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,690
like the game the round the players the

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,640
cards and all my players were completely

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:28,090
random they would just select cards out

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,400
of their hand using sample and I would

00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:33,910
print out whoever won the game and how

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,310
long the game took my next version saw

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:39,340
the inclusion of winning by reaching a

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,950
certain number of points to do so you

00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,360
just input the starting energy for each

00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,190
one of the players and the amount of

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,640
energy required to win the game and you

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:52,030
could get another simulation you can see

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,220
that then the output I had was very very

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:57,220
verbose this is truncated because there

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,900
were 47 turns in that game but that was

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,240
because I was simulating just one game

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,340
at a time so the next thing I did was

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,180
naturally wrap it so that I simulate

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,740
multiple games each time this was to

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,390
give me a more statistical

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,330
look at how my game is playing as a

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,610
whole I started to look at how long a

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,410
game lasts given the current random

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,420
nature of my players in the system I

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,950
would print out the average number of

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:26,290
turns and how many times each player one

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,240
my thinking was that the players are

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,250
completely random each one of them

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,610
should win roughly the same amount of

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:36,430
times now the most important class in my

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,500
code was my action resolver class it

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,440
receives the board States for a certain

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,690
pairing of player and target and it

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,380
returns a result of the change of energy

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:49,270
required for each one of the two players

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:52,000
the action resolvers were instantiated

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,459
inside a round resolver class that would

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,940
resolve the actions for each one of the

00:11:54,459 --> 00:12:00,880
players and their relative targets sorry

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,510
and in turn that was run inside my game

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,820
round class now the code for the action

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,070
resolver was written in a way that

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,200
enabled me to easily play around and

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,720
change the rules of the system it was

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,149
really important for me that the essence

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,279
of my rules the interactions between the

00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:22,060
different actions on the table was both

00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:25,540
easy to read and easy the change I had a

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:28,540
sort of dsl written out to show how each

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,180
action resolves so one of the first

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,700
changes i added to the rules was that if

00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,589
you're trying to charge and someone is

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,089
attacking you then your charge is

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,459
disabled then you don't get the point

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,860
you can see that the change in the rules

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,630
was very minimal it was only one line of

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,230
code and doesn't affect the readability

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:49,329
of the method whatsoever I was using the

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,829
amazing Hoshi library and lots of parts

00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:55,480
of my code it's been super helpful if

00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:56,980
you haven't used hash yet I highly

00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,620
recommend you take a look I've been

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,410
using it in all of my projects from

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,450
parsing api's to working with the

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:08,440
command line or even simulating board

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:10,360
games it's really cool so now as a few

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,399
weeks and to playing around with a game

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,790
and I felt good enough to try and test

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,829
it out on humans I used some blank cards

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,949
and cubes I stole from another game I

00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:22,460
borrowed from another game and I traded

00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:26,270
this very first throat

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:30,580
I have a small tip for people who like

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:34,220
to create stuff plus a plug for ebay I

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,230
have a kid at home i call it my makers

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,180
kit it has all the stuff I need to

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,040
quickly prototype anything I want to

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:44,690
whether it's video games board games

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:47,270
website or mobile apps it consists of a

00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,930
bunch of empty playing cards post-it

00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:54,560
notes dice tokens pens and markers and

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,810
evil like a small hourglass I use it

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,940
every time I need physical stimulation

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,210
for my creative process and I've found

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,520
it very helpful in a lot of cases so

00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,440
back to the prototype I drew all the

00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,050
cards for the actions and for the

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,080
computers i chose like computers from

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,510
popular culture how from 2001 a Space

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,870
Odyssey and Skynet from terminator just

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:19,730
to name a few we played a few rounds of

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,910
the game at work this is Gail apna is

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,610
one of our developers and it helped me

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:29,570
understand how humans or developers play

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:32,740
my game I took the feedback from these

00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:36,140
first sessions and went back to coding I

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,510
started working on expanding my players

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,670
in the system I no longer wanted just

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,860
the random players who would do check

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,570
and do random things and you can see

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,210
that in the code for the players I

00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,310
emphasize the same things I did in the

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:53,180
action resolver class and that was

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:55,130
simplicity and ease of change so I wrote

00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,230
a simple player and that was just an

00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,170
extension of my random players in the

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,970
system but with a bit of improvement

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,620
instead of being completely random they

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,810
try to defend themselves whenever

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,550
they're under attack and they try to

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:12,110
heal up whenever they're low on energy I

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,880
improved the interface of the system

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,040
every step of the way and I started

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,080
pitting these new simple players i wrote

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,830
against the completely random ones i

00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,720
already had in the system I saw them

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,270
completely outperforming the random

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,580
players or at least like by seven

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,960
percent which was good enough for me and

00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,620
that was a good thing because it meant

00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,540
that a my simple player was actually

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,170
smarter than the random player which is

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,529
good

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,570
and B if you play random in my game the

00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:45,139
chances of you winning are lower that if

00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,790
you think while playing I felt happy

00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:48,529
with my new simple players and I wanted

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,329
to start testing the effect of the

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,850
number of player has on the length of

00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:55,760
the game to do that i created a

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,370
multi-variant test which ran 10,000

00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,260
simulations / combination that I built I

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,839
had a hundred and fifty different

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,540
combinations of the number of players

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,540
the starting energy and the energy

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,209
acquired to win the game for each one of

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:15,290
these combinations I simulated 10,000

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:17,949
games and the output was the average

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:21,589
number of turns for each combination

00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:23,810
this resulted in 1.5 million simulations

00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:28,010
of the game that took about 40 minutes

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:29,660
and a lot of dated to go over I did what

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:34,160
you do with big data and they put it in

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:36,769
a chart if we zoom into the chart you

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,550
can see that the average turns Peaks

00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:42,380
every time that the starting energy is

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,870
exactly half of the energy required to

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:48,079
win the game and it made perfect sense

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,850
to me since both zero energy and the

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,490
energy required to win the game our end

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,490
game cases for a certain player if a

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,019
player starts his energy at exactly half

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:01,240
of it he's at a point of equilibrium

00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:03,949
between the two winning conditions I

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,339
then looked at how adding another player

00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:09,829
affect the length of the game each chunk

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:13,010
here represents another player added to

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,270
the game while inside is I'm testing out

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,600
the different starting energy

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:20,780
combinations I saw two trend lines in

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,480
the graph the top one represents the

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,089
average turns per player when the

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,980
starting energy is set too high and the

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,049
bottom one shows the average turns per

00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,780
player when the starting energy is set

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,760
too low you can see that the top one is

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,040
much stronger meaning that when the

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,650
starting energy was set too high each

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,809
extra player added to the game lengthen

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,080
the game more so that if the starting

00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:47,900
energy would have been set to low now I

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,970
use this chart and this data to help me

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,340
hone on the variables of my game

00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:55,640
I could make an educated decision to

00:17:52,340 --> 00:18:00,289
start the game at five energy and to set

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,880
the winning energy at twice that 10 so I

00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:04,610
went back and modified some other

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,679
aspects of my rule system I made it so

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:09,380
that if you block but no one is trying

00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,630
to attack you you lose one energy point

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,090
the really cool thing is that after

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,980
doing such a change in my system I could

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,110
now run a regression using the

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,539
multi-variant test and compare the

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,510
change in the game that was really

00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:25,669
really helpful I was feeling good about

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,440
the game and the numbers of the game and

00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:30,049
I decided to turn my attention and

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,610
creating a nicer prototype I started

00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:33,350
with a bit of design and created the

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,200
unique persona for each one of the

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:38,900
computers I did some let's call it

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,750
research which was me watching 80s

00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,909
movies about computers and I came up

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,710
with some really cool computers based on

00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:48,020
the research some of them were inspired

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,700
by movies some of them from games and

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:54,409
some of them from cleaning my living

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:56,179
room can you guess which one I ordered

00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:58,610
my first prototype from a company called

00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:00,169
the game crafter they provide a printing

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,090
service were went for when you're

00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:04,450
working with small quantities which is

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,980
great when you want to make a prototype

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,140
your they have a web interface where you

00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,780
can just upload any arch you want four

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,490
cards boards or boxes and they also have

00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,830
a huge collection of little bits and

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,559
pieces everything from sheep two people

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:21,470
to grain two missiles they didn't have

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,179
computers all of them the first

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,130
prototype arrived in the mail and it

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:27,559
looked awesome getting a

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:31,580
physical copy of something you both is

00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:34,429
extremely exciting we sat down to play

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:37,220
it at work that very day and the custom

00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:40,190
card art and the huge yellow cubes added

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,740
a lot of feel to the game we did

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:45,650
encounter some several issues like he's

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,080
holding one of the cards upside down and

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,549
I had to go back to the drawing board or

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,070
coding board or whatever you want to

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:54,140
call it I used the time working on the

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,590
code again to test another theory i had

00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:00,049
i started by creating a single-minded

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,880
player or l she got him a stupid single

00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,710
night and player a flare they would do

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,520
the same action over and over

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:10,220
over again without changing I ran these

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,320
new single minded flares one by one the

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,890
attacker one at first then the blocker

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,169
than the charger and I I compared him to

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,870
my simple players I already had in the

00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:24,140
system each one of them lost which was

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:28,990
great and I haven't another small quiz

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:31,640
for you after running all these three

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,340
single-minded versions of my players the

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,679
attacker the blocker and the charger I

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,740
saw that four games of four or more

00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,330
people if you charge all the time you

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,270
have a higher chance than if you would

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:48,799
block all the time so I'll let you think

00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:50,750
a bit about why that exactly is so after

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,090
this last iteration I started towards

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,730
printing in an even better prototype I

00:20:53,090 --> 00:21:00,110
worked on getting the rules having

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:02,360
player aids and the nice box I'll go in

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:05,380
another small tangent and say that

00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,760
writing rules is really really hard

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:12,230
although it does remind me a bit of

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,990
coding you can instinctively tell good

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,450
rules from bad ones the more you read

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:20,330
other people's work the easier it is to

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,250
might write your own and while writing

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,220
rules you want to make sure you keep it

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:28,370
dry don't repeat yourself which I just

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,289
did you want to keep the rules as short

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,230
and concise as possible and were never

00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:36,950
able refer people to other sections of

00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:38,840
the rules so I had to rewrite my rule

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,610
book I think two or three times and

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,039
refactor it another two or three times

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:46,159
but I was happy with them in the end and

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,470
ordered another prototype I received

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,720
this new prototype and I took it to the

00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,390
monthly board game eat up that I attend

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,820
in Tel Aviv I got to play a few rounds

00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,649
of the game that day with people willing

00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,440
to help me test the game out and it was

00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:04,490
really fun to get to play it with other

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,559
people a couple of meetups later i

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,600
bought the game with me and placed it on

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,309
the huge piles of game we had at the

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,779
center of the room where everyone can

00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:13,789
just come and take whatever they want to

00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:16,610
say that day and I was playing something

00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:17,539
else across the room I saw someone going

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,889
to this pile of

00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:22,190
games going through the different games

00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:26,450
picking up my game opening the box and

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:28,100
starting to go over the rules I then got

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,009
to experience something totally awesome

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,350
for the first time ever a group of

00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:35,389
people which I didn't know we're playing

00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:38,179
the game without me being involved at

00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:39,979
all they just picked up the game learned

00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:42,440
the rules and started playing all by

00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:44,779
themselves it was such a rush to see

00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,159
that happen of course once i saw them

00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:50,690
starting to play i went over and started

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:54,769
filming them taking pictures i think

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:57,529
they suspected it then so I haven't

00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:59,749
finished the game yet I might still get

00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:02,059
to get to try and get it published one

00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:04,369
day so keep your eyes peeled for it out

00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:07,970
there but for now it had just has to be

00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:09,919
one of my cooler side projects I posted

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,509
the code for the simulator on github

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,879
you're welcome to take a look through it

00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:16,129
I can't promise anything it's not as

00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:19,190
clean as it was in the presentation but

00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:21,440
it works now I was kind of worried I

00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,299
won't be able to do this next part due

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,919
to production and shipping issues which

00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:29,419
is kind of weird to say at a ruby

00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:31,249
conference but they made it and I'm

00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:33,349
happy to announce that i'm giving away

00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:36,619
four copies of the prototype here at

00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:39,200
doga ruko this is a special edition I

00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:43,129
created specifically for this event with

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,960
a special computer the goga bots and to

00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:47,450
enter the raffle all you need to do is

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,419
tweet about your first computer and add

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:53,450
the hashtags go guru co and micro chips

00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:54,950
and later today I'll I have a script and

00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,080
it will go through Twitter and find the

00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:01,039
four winners and will announce them and

00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:04,399
they'll get the copy i hope you enjoyed

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,859
this short very short journey through

00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:09,349
board gaming with me my name is Jonathan

00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:12,049
Bergman feel free to come out and check

00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:15,070
out the game or just say hi and thank

00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:15,070
you so much for having me here

00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,810
you

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,940
