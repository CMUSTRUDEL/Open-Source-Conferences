Title: GoGaRuCo 2014- Technical Onboarding, Training, and Mentoring
Publication date: 2020-01-23
Playlist: GoGaRuCo 2014
Description: 
	By, Kate Heddleston
With the increase of code academies training new engineers there is an increase in junior engineers on the market. A lot of companies are hesitant to hire too many young engineers because they lack sufficient resources to train them. This is a talk about how to make junior engineers into independent and productive members of your engineering team faster and cheaper by outlining a plan for how to onboard engineers effectively based on data and anecdotes gathered from companies in San Francisco.

	00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,400
so my name is Kate Huddleston this talk

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,400
is called technical onboarding training

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,740
and mentoring it was originally written

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,510
and co-presented at PyCon with Nicole

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,840
Zuckerman she's not here today but she

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,269
is a software engineer at Eventbrite

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,590
she's the one that's not me so I will

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,710
let you use your powers of deductive

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,420
reasoning so I'm a software engineer I

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,309
work at a company called run scope I

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,710
usually work at really small early-stage

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,260
startups I've never joined one larger

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,329
than twelve so I usually join companies

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,340
that don't have any onboarding and this

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,620
talk was originally written because

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,750
nicole and i had separate experiences

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,550
completely independent where we joined

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,100
two companies and there was no

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,300
onboarding and we learned a bunch of

00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,520
stuff and about a year later we looked

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,020
back and we were like a little bit of

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,270
onboarding would have gotten us to this

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,470
point much faster and so we turned

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,570
around and started implementing

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,970
onboarding for the new employees at our

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:15,360
respective companies so first what is

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,610
onboarding this talk focuses a lot on

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,259
junior engineers many of the things that

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,140
I talk about can be co-opted for

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,000
mid-level or senior engineers but I

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,320
specifically focus on junior engineers

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,659
because there are a lot of code

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,070
academies that are putting out a lot of

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,570
junior engineers and companies are

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,450
having a hard time absorbing these

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,009
engineers into their organizations but

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,720
onboarding is the process of taking

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,880
someone from outside of the company

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,909
outside of the team outside of the group

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,280
and making them a productive confident

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,439
and independent member of your team and

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,009
I picked these things these three things

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,079
very specifically and I'll go over them

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,970
although productivity is pretty

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,920
straightforward there's a lot of apps

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,479
and blog posts about how to be more

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,619
productive and efficient it's important

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,530
but the bulk of this talk is about

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:05,700
independence and autonomy and confidence

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,450
so autonomy is hugely important

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,790
independence in new engineers it's a big

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,230
motivator I also have two somewhat

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,319
depressing anecdotes about the

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,690
of autonomy the first is in prison

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,040
systems so prisoners by definition have

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,840
no autonomy they're stripped of all

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,150
autonomy all ability to make decisions

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,860
and when they started doing their

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,069
research on the sociology of inmates

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,459
they realized that giving inmates the

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:34,549
ability to choose the TV channel and to

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,620
rearrange their own furniture seemingly

00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:38,549
mundane choices significantly reduced

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,079
prison riots

00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:44,700
so autonomy reduces riots this is good

00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,530
the second depressing anecdote has to do

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,879
with nursing homes it's another place

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,440
where people are stripped of autonomy

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,540
although in this case they're usually

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,540
stripped of autonomy in order to provide

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,129
good care but they're also they don't

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,489
have any choices about what they do and

00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:02,160
they found that people in nursing homes

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,140
who had choices like what to eat and had

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,510
some small responsibilities like chores

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,709
and cleaning lived significantly longer

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,640
than those that had no choices

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,810
so autonomy also prevents death so you

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,150
want independent people on your team

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,510
it's a great motivator but it actually

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:23,209
also is really critical both to life and

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:25,380
our happiness confidence confidence is

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,810
most people will agree very very

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,639
important but what is confidence

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,650
confidence is really the belief that you

00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,419
are valuable and the fact that it's the

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,669
belief that you are valuable is hugely

00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:40,470
important how many of you have heard of

00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:42,329
the stereotype threat anyone a few it's

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,989
actually a pretty well researched and

00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:49,440
documented phenomenon someone decided to

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,669
basically go figure out if people if

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,799
people play to stereotypes

00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:55,260
if stereotypes are true and what they

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,410
found was that statistically people will

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,900
play to stereotypes so some examples of

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,359
stereotypes and I in no way can don't

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,700
justify these that Asians are better at

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:08,790
math men are better with computers women

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,930
are better at nurturing etc so what they

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,510
did is they took some of the

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,160
quantifiable stereotypes and if you

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,099
remind a group of people before they

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,440
take a math test for example that men

00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:21,510
are better at math what happens is men

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,010
perform better on that test and women

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,330
perform worse than the control group

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,120
where they're not reminded of the

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,520
stereotype what they also found was the

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,530
if you flip that on its head if you tell

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,760
a group women are better at math we've

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,320
actually found that women perform better

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,930
on these types of spatial reasoning

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,699
problems women will perform better and

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,280
men will perform worse than the control

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,750
group so it's not really about whether

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,510
or not the stereotype is true

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,250
it's about this belief this idea that I

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,630
am capable of learning these things or I

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,630
am capable of being good at these things

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,280
so why do you care I think a lot of

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,630
people care about onboarding what I want

00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,070
to convince you of is not that you

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,110
should care in general it's that you

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,310
should care right now that onboarding

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,620
isn't something that you should do next

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,970
month or next year that onboarding is

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,860
something that you should do immediately

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:12,570
like automating your deploy so there's

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,979
four major categories that I'm going to

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,200
talk about as to why onboarding is

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,300
important the first is the individual

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,190
the second is the company in the bottom

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,410
line the third is the immediate team

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:26,840
that a person joins and the fourth bonus

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:30,539
category is diversity so the individual

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,250
it's pretty obvious for individuals that

00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:35,430
training is important learning skills

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:38,669
having an upward trajectory confident

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,840
productive independent but also losing

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,060
an engineer at a company is really

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,530
expensive and having engineers they're

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,860
not as productive as they could be is

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,979
also a loss of money so losing an

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,530
engineer can be 1.5 - 2 X the cost the

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,360
annual salary of that engineer and while

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,789
onboarding or a lack of onboarding

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,380
doesn't lead directly to attrition good

00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:04,550
onboarding will mitigate things like

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:06,240
that so for the company's bottom line

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,889
companies care about money

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,300
they build products and they sell them

00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,030
and hopefully they make more money than

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,770
they burn for companies when you add a

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,180
new engineer to the team you want to

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,610
make more money or you want to build

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,470
product that will make more money and so

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,440
what you don't want is this this is bad

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,180
and LinkedIn found a couple years back

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,340
that this is exactly what was happening

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,229
at their organization they hired a new

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,970
senior vice president of engineering and

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,740
they had to freeze all hiring they had

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,080
to stop hiring engineers because every

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,729
engineer they added to the team

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,500
decreased their productivity so they had

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,450
to do all of this reorganization they

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,620
had to put in place onboarding and

00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,430
figure out what was going

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,259
so that they could get something like

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,539
this and they could hire new engineers

00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:48,939
so this is this is incredibly expensive

00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,860
not only our engineers really in really

00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:53,169
expensive employees but if you're losing

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,909
money for every expensive employee that

00:06:53,169 --> 00:07:00,189
you add that's a pretty bad business

00:06:54,909 --> 00:07:04,469
model so the individual team that a

00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:04,469
person joins is also really important

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,520
you don't know something until you teach

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,620
it that's kind of an old adage and so

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,409
when a new person comes on board you

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,090
need to teach them about your processes

00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:18,430
your team culture how you get things

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,379
done your values and this is good for

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,879
the existing team because every time a

00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:25,419
new person is added that team

00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:28,449
fundamentally changes so I I played a

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:30,580
lot of sports I coached and I have a lot

00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,830
of sports anecdotes but basically this

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,210
is true on sporting teams every time the

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,560
senior class leaves in a freshman class

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,190
comes in it's a fundamentally different

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,110
team

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,430
so as you're scaling your company and

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,680
you're adding new engineers you're not

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,810
the same team if you go from 10 to 20

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,360
you're a different team so what you need

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,190
to do is reiterate the values not just

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,409
to the new people coming on board but

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,310
also to the existing team members you

00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,840
want everyone going in the same

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,699
direction and that's not something that

00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,650
can just happen on its own it's

00:07:54,699 --> 00:08:00,849
something that every single incremental

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,770
step of the way you need to reiterate so

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,349
having that onboarding is a little bit

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,259
like having good deploy automation it's

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:10,389
absolutely critical and having it will

00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:11,770
pay off hugely the amount of time you

00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,629
put in to having good onboarding and

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,690
having the deploy will pay off enormous

00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,919
Lee especially if you do it early

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,979
because rather than having to go build

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,419
this huge heroic system later on you can

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:26,650
just incrementally add to the one that

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:31,120
you already have so this is my favorite

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:33,070
equation that I've ever made up back

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,050
when I finished playing water polo I

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,880
coached JV girls swimming in water polo

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,800
and I used to have these really great

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,979
philosophical team meetings with them

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,269
that they absolutely loved and I came in

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,000
with a poster board one day with this

00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:47,350
written on it like this is really

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,550
important everyone like I have this

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:53,350
equation I need you to understand this

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,160
your ability to win games your ability

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,769
to be successful

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,170
as a team is the sum of your talent or

00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,519
the sum of your skill sets multiplied by

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,269
your ability to work together as a team

00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,829
so you can all be medium skilled or

00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,620
beginners but if you work together

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:10,029
incredibly well you can beat teams that

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,509
are quote unquote more talented than you

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:15,759
are so you know there's a lot of Disney

00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:17,290
movies about this as well but you can

00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,529
you can overcome challenges through

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,420
teamwork and we found that that's true

00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,250
in software engineering as well really

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,170
small teams can be hugely productive if

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,879
they work together efficiently in fact a

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,529
lot of the biggest products that we use

00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:31,480
today are built by teams of less than 10

00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:34,180
engineers Gmail is a really good example

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,040
it was built by a team I think of less

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,370
than seven and it's now maintained by a

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,720
team of over 400 I want to say so you

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,310
can build awesome stuff with a small

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,050
team that's highly productive and works

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,160
together really well conversely if you

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,930
have a bunch of really talented

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,389
engineers who don't work together at all

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:54,459
you're just gonna completely fall apart

00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:56,800
so our bonus section diversity I use

00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:58,240
snitches to represent diversity so for

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,240
those of you who don't know the dr.

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,699
Seuss story the dr. Seuss story is about

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,350
a community of snitches and some of them

00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:07,899
start developing stars on their bellies

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,730
and this separates them from the non

00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,769
star bellied snitches and it causes

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,920
rifts and it's supposed to represent

00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:16,779
different demographics I use snitches

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,189
because diversity can mean a lot of

00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,470
things to a lot of different teams

00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:22,269
there's the classic examples of gender

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,579
diversity and racial diversity but

00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:27,939
there's also things like in Traverse

00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:29,290
introverts versus extroverts so if you

00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:31,870
have a team of introverts and you bring

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,339
on an extrovert or vice-versa that can

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,880
also be something that you need to think

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:38,829
about so onboarding is really important

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,800
for diversity if you have it a

00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:43,569
homogeneous group which is pretty common

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,000
with startups and companies to have a

00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:48,040
homogenous core existing group and you

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,569
have no onboarding the people who are

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,850
going to be most successful and have the

00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:53,980
best time getting up to speed are people

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,259
who are like the existing group this is

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,930
because a lot of onboarding has to do

00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:00,309
with communicating and someone who's

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,139
like the existing group is going to be

00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:03,220
able to communicate more easily they're

00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,949
probably going to have similar hobbies

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,630
shared interests so they're going to be

00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:09,340
able to talk to the existing

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,690
grupe learn about the product learn

00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,340
about engineering and get up to speed

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,230
faster so you're gonna have this

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,500
feedback loop of hiring more and more

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,030
people like the core group conversely

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,920
people who are different who don't

00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,330
necessarily communicate the same way who

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,030
don't have the same hobbies or interests

00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:28,150
maybe people have children and they join

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:31,930
a team of young adults who like to go

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,400
out and drink it's gonna be harder for

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,650
them if there's not explicit onboarding

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,510
so explicit onboarding makes it possible

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,760
for people who are different from the

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,530
core group to learn about the product to

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,300
learn about the company to come on board

00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,400
and get up to speed and it doesn't

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:50,260
disadvantage them disproportionately

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:52,540
against basically the existing group so

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,240
who should on board everybody should on

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,020
board this is not ants carrying a taco

00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:03,580
this is people carrying a canoe I drew

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:05,620
all of these myself so everyone should

00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,330
on board spread out the load there's a

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,420
common misconception that only senior

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:12,040
people can teach the best rule of thumb

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,810
is actually that the last person who did

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,940
something should teach it first off

00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,680
they're still excited about it second

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,090
off they know it the best and third you

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,020
can spread out the load that way so

00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:24,400
someone who just learned about your

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,720
automation configuration system is going

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,820
to be great to turn around and teach it

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,190
the best people - onward junior

00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,690
engineers are not senior engineers they

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,850
are the people who are just junior

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,280
engineers so when you go into college

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,110
and you play a sport the freshmen are

00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,070
not actually on boarded by the seniors

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,960
on the team

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,400
it's the sophomores because the

00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,830
sophomores were just freshmen last year

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,170
they know what it's like they still have

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,670
empathy for the problems whereas the

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,760
further you get away from them the less

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:55,870
empathy you have and also you get really

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,100
cynical as you get more senior so you

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,000
want someone who still has a little bit

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,420
of that enthusiasm so when should you on

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,060
board

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,950
onboarding starts from offer acceptance

00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,050
in the start date and it goes all the

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,850
way until reliable independence and this

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,890
is true no matter what the level of the

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,510
engineer so someone who's junior

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,670
reliable independence might take six

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,690
months someone who's really senior could

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,130
come on board and be reliably

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,830
independent with about within about like

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,640
a day three days I mean who knows it

00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,230
could be really really

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,820
asked but that's the whole point of

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,079
onboarding is to take someone to make

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:31,630
them reliably independent in your

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:33,730
organization and how so how has two

00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,110
sections the first is a little bit of

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,700
the philosophy about how you should

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,350
think about onboarding and then I'm

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,510
gonna go into an example of an

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,160
onboarding plan that you can pick and

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:46,390
choose from to create your own

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,589
onboarding plan you don't have to be

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,060
completely altruistic when you're

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,170
thinking about onboarding you really

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,420
want to maximize the return on

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,130
investment you don't want to put way

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,899
more into onboarding people then you get

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,180
out of it that doesn't make sense that's

00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:01,420
not sustainable that's actually crazy I

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:04,329
don't know why you'd want to do that but

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,029
it's actually a really common pitfall so

00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:10,839
this is a really common first-time

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:12,459
mentor thing that happens where they

00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,470
want to handhold the new junior engineer

00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:16,360
they're so excited about being a mentor

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,800
like this is gonna be awesome we're

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,029
gonna do everything together and I'm

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,070
going to teach them everything we know

00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,149
we're gonna do tutorials and by the time

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,399
I'm done with them they're gonna know

00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:26,440
everything that I know and this is

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,449
wildly unrealistic and it also leads to

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,920
high burnout rates so the senior

00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:31,660
engineer is putting in so much time to

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,459
this junior engineer that by the time

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,079
the junior engineer is finally on board

00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:36,459
at the senior engineer is exhausted and

00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,440
they're like I can't on board anyone

00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,209
else and so the company is like well we

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,310
can't really hire more junior engineers

00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:45,760
if we don't have anyone to mentor them

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,870
and on board them so instead you should

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,820
think about it kind of like bumper

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,339
bowling you want to put in place enough

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,079
structure and enough process to get them

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:54,519
going in the right direction but it

00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,620
doesn't really matter if they hit the

00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,149
lane the whole way down they'll get

00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,949
better they'll practice it'll be fine

00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:02,620
they're going in the right direction and

00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:04,660
a lot of putting in place a structure

00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,279
like this without having to handhold

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,529
people involves creating really good

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,269
automation at your company really good

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,880
dev environment set up really good

00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,949
testing really good deploy systems so a

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,540
huge amount of creating a great

00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:18,310
environment for junior engineers it's

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,449
very technical you want a lot of

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:24,310
automation it's also important to

00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:26,380
remember that one of the tenants of

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,050
expertise is the ability to set

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,000
boundaries so when you're an expert you

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,860
have a really really in-depth

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,260
understanding of the landscape you're

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,480
able to scope and set boundaries

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,700
and break brake problems down into

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,070
really small manageable pieces by

00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,570
definition beginners cannot do this they

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,190
don't know what the landscape is so how

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,830
could they possibly scope problems down

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,360
to the appropriate size so it's

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,210
important to remember that part of your

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,640
job in setting up onboarding tasks is to

00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:56,850
scope them to just scope things really

00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,140
really well for new junior engineers

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,810
bug-fixing is a good example of well

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,180
scoped projects so a bug has a clearly

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,100
defined problem usually has a pretty

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,870
clearly defined solution for a lot of

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,210
them and so they're by nature well

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,890
scoped projects those are great actually

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:17,890
really great to give to junior engineers

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:21,550
so an example onboarding plan it covers

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,960
three major categories each one of these

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,490
is about a third of what someone needs

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,710
to learn when they come on board we

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,720
think for some reason those engineers

00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,790
that the technical knowledge is 90% of

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,510
it it's not there's a ton of online

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,590
documentation and a ton of resources a

00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,450
third of what someone needs to know is

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,870
the company knowledge and process how do

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,820
I build here how have we built here what

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,560
framework do we use how did we hack this

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,240
framework to pieces so that doesn't look

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,890
anything like the original framework and

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,290
I need to know about that and there's no

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,880
documentation and then the third

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,910
category is personal development so

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,110
developing confidence and excitement

00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,670
around what you're doing so that you go

00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,560
off and you learn things on your own and

00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,320
you believe that you're capable of

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:06,610
learning all of the millions of things

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,770
thrown at you as a new engineer so I've

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,829
broken it in two phases these were

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,630
originally weeks but I decided phases

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,550
makes more sense because it doesn't

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,730
really matter how long each section

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,980
takes it just matters that kind of each

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,199
section is dealt with in phase one is

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,660
shipping stuff so when someone comes on

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,160
board you want them to ship things the

00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,130
first step of that is dev environment

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,330
setup and someone should be able to set

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,200
up their development environment in a

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,190
day that is an awesome goal if someone

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,780
can't set up their development

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,490
environment in the first week it's worth

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,230
dedicating a lot of resources to it

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,640
especially because this isn't something

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,400
that junior engineers have to do it's

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,320
something that all engineers have to do

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,690
the best person to help someone set up

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,519
their dev environment is

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,409
to be the last person who did it so you

00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,080
should never have burnout on mentorship

00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:56,399
for dev environment setup because the

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,440
last person who did it is always going

00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:02,759
to change shipping code preferably you

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,830
want someone to ship code the first day

00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,240
if you can get them to do it the first

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,490
day that is awesome you get a gold star

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,259
if they can do it in the first three

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,299
days that is still really good the first

00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:13,940
week is preferable and if it's not in

00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,230
the first week I would highly recommend

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,490
dedicating some resources to DevOps so

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,799
that people can ship code within the

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,179
first week of joining the company have

00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,519
them shipped small changes it can be a

00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,899
config file the point of this isn't to

00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,759
have them alter your codebase

00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:28,710
significantly it's to have them

00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:31,259
understand the process for how you ship

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,539
code how do you open a pull request how

00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,370
does that pull requests get merged who

00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:38,129
decides that pull request is ready to go

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:42,779
how is that pull request then deployed

00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:44,759
out to production the third thing is

00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:46,470
journaling and note-taking people will

00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:47,580
naturally do this because they can't

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,919
remember all of the things they need to

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,690
do so just give them a notebook

00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,919
basically just tell them that they're

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,330
gonna have a lot of stuff that they need

00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,159
to remember so they should write it down

00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,480
it's a nice way to check back into

00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:01,019
because if they've written it all down

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,940
you can go take a look at it and then

00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,320
finally a social event and this should

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,149
be done for everyone this should be done

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,379
the first week and the reason that you

00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:09,210
want to have a social event the first

00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,860
week is because people need to talk to

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,509
their teammates they would like to know

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,070
who they are this can just be the

00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:16,259
immediate team the five people that they

00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,120
have to work closely with if they join

00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,610
you know one specific team you can go

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,169
get lunch go get coffee people just want

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,990
to know other people's names so that

00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:28,590
when they have a problem they can go and

00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,480
say hey Amanda instead of standing

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:34,620
awkwardly beside their desk and staring

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,769
at them until they look up phase two

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,429
phase two is the big section on talk to

00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:40,440
your teammates

00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:42,990
so after phase one someone's able to

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,120
ship code they are able to open pull

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,350
requests push them out to production do

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,659
kind of the core of what it is that we

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:51,690
do as an engineer phase two is a lot

00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:53,669
about integrating with the team more so

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,220
the history of the company and a team

00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:58,230
map are some of the best things to do in

00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,869
this phase the history of the company

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,519
people love to do on the first day and I

00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:03,960
don't know if you guys have joined a new

00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,039
company lately but on the first day

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,899
you're still trying to figure out where

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,610
the bathroom is and so the history of

00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:10,379
the company is just not gonna sink in

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,730
you also don't know any of the

00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:13,830
characters in the story because you

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,929
haven't met anyone at the company so do

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,399
this the second week or the third week

00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:19,710
but do it when people can actually

00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:21,869
absorb the story about how this company

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,730
was started and why all of the different

00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:25,710
people are there and then give them a

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,259
map where do people sit what are their

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,909
names and what do they do most often you

00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:31,649
know this person is person who works

00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:33,990
with chef at our company this person

00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:35,789
works mostly with api's they can then

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,529
look at the map rather than having to go

00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,470
ask people what someone else's name was

00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:42,389
or who do I go talk to for this they can

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:47,460
just go find that person so that gives

00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:48,990
them independence fairly early shadowing

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,119
and code labs are good to get started at

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,429
this point code labs or something that

00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,480
they actually do at Eventbrite

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,879
Eventbrite has they've done a really

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,580
good job of hiring people from

00:20:56,879 --> 00:21:02,220
half-bright the code academy it's a

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,809
Python code Academy for women so they've

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,909
put together a fairly robust onboarding

00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:08,159
process and it involved code labs which

00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:11,399
was a weekly safe space to ask questions

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,230
and the emphasis is on safe because when

00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:15,869
someone is really new they feel like all

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,460
of their questions are stupid even if

00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:18,960
they aren't and so having someone

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,730
hostess who's really good at making

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,029
people feel comfortable asking stupid

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,649
questions is hugely important and the

00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:27,210
code labs can be about anything it can

00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:29,720
be on any topic it can be run by any

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,740
engineer who's interested in running it

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,690
shadowing and pairing is really

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,100
important at this point I was having a

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,500
discussion earlier about the difference

00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,029
between shadowing and pairing shadowing

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,809
is following someone and watching their

00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:45,899
workflow pairing is working with someone

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:49,350
to achieve a task both are valuable both

00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:52,379
are really good shadowing sometimes you

00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,119
can if you shadow someone who's too far

00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:57,509
advanced you can lose track of what's

00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:58,860
going on but it is a bit of a fine art

00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:00,360
form to figure out exactly how much

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,250
shadowing and exactly how much pairing

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,110
someone needs so I don't have any exact

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,320
response to whether or not you should do

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:09,720
this all the time or how much phase

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,740
three phase three is decide who you want

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,440
to be when you grow up

00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,279
so now that the person can ship code and

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,499
do basic

00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,629
engineering tasks they feel connected to

00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:20,099
their teammate and their company they

00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:23,249
need to decide what they want to do next

00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:26,279
do I want to build product features do I

00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:28,080
want to be in the UX space do I want to

00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,399
do DevOps and at this point they should

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,559
hopefully have a better idea of the

00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:35,580
landscape and the people on the team so

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:37,349
companies should have weekly one-on-ones

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,909
everyone should have a weekly one-on-one

00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:40,559
with their manager I also believe that

00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:41,969
people should be able to electively have

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,239
one-on-ones with anyone they want at the

00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:47,190
company this is hugely important having

00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,809
communication channels even if they come

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,460
in once a week and tell you that

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:52,289
everything is great I'm doing fine like

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,940
I'm so happy here you should still meet

00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:56,129
with them once a week because if

00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,899
something is is bad if something's going

00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:59,789
wrong that communication channel is

00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:01,200
gonna become critical really fast and

00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:03,419
you have no idea of knowing when that's

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,739
gonna happen so if you don't have weekly

00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,989
one-on-ones and you don't have these

00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:08,789
communication channels you basically put

00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:11,039
the onus on people with less power to

00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:13,049
come to people with more power with bad

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:17,009
news and that is a terrible terrible

00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:19,019
thing to have to do goal setting and

00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:21,629
feedback goal setting sounds really lame

00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,570
I don't know why but it's so important

00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:26,190
is this is this is basically the what do

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,349
I wanted like what kind of engineer do I

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,729
want to be who do I want to be and so

00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:32,719
sitting down with someone and and

00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:34,889
talking about this and setting goals is

00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:37,019
so important I don't know why we don't

00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:39,089
do more of it and then giving them

00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:40,559
feedback constant feedback not only

00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:41,820
about what they need to improve but what

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,320
they're doing well because remember

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,019
someone who's junior doesn't know what

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,749
they're doing well so having that

00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:51,119
feedback is great positive feedback is

00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:53,039
so important because if if you only come

00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,450
with negative feedback every time you

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,129
walk up to their desk there's gonna be a

00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,479
little little pang of fear I've had

00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:58,950
managers like that they only come up to

00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:00,179
me whenever they tell me that I did

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,940
something wrong and so whenever they

00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:04,559
walk up to my desk I'm like oh no even

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,690
if they they wanted to do something fun

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,469
so don't do that give them positive

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:12,450
feedback and then presentations the best

00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:14,159
way to to learn something is to teach so

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,809
if you want someone to learn regular

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,580
expressions have them give a 10 minute

00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,559
presentation on regular expressions if

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,419
you want someone to learn about your

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,549
deploy system have them give a 10 minute

00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,499
presentation on your deploy system it's

00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:26,970
pretty simple I think it's great to get

00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:27,779
started organizing things into

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,399
presentations

00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:31,409
they can be entirely internal they can

00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:32,969
be just to one person so if someone has

00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:37,349
a lot of stage fright they don't have to

00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:40,649
speak publicly to your company and then

00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:43,529
phase four is repeat so review concepts

00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:45,419
check and regularly kind of let them

00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:47,700
electively shadow let them start to make

00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,960
decisions about their own life how they

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,409
want to learn things how they want to

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,409
grow

00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:53,700
let them copilot a larger project so let

00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,830
them work with someone who's more senior

00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,809
who has an emergency brake on the

00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,309
passenger side but also remember that

00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:00,960
junior engineers go really really well

00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:02,609
with senior engineers because junior

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,589
engineers are still excited about the

00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:06,210
mundane tasks but senior engineers don't

00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:08,309
want to build so you put them together

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,559
and you have one person who's so excited

00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:12,149
about getting all of these introductory

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:17,249
tasks done and someone else who's so

00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:19,349
excited about not having to do them and

00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:22,799
then beyond the assessment category is

00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:24,899
really important well assessment in

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,129
apprenticeship so similar to co-piloting

00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:30,899
apprenticeship is a time-tested tool for

00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:32,549
people to learn you basically just put

00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:33,989
them next to someone else who's really

00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:36,539
good at something and eventually over

00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:38,669
time they learn it that's how all trades

00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:41,190
were passed on for a very long time

00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:42,389
that's how it works in sports you

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,219
usually just pair with someone who's

00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:45,450
really good at something and the better

00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:48,619
the person you're paired with the better

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:51,539
you end up being when it's all over and

00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:53,429
then assessment so assessment can be

00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:55,289
really tricky because people have wildly

00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:58,549
different trajectories some people just

00:25:55,289 --> 00:26:00,960
take off other people have ups and downs

00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:03,059
sometimes people don't work out and that

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,849
is a reality you want to give everyone

00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,049
the best shot possible you want to have

00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:09,869
faith in them you want to give them

00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:11,909
chances but you also want to identify

00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:13,349
when someone is not doing well and when

00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:15,330
someone is not a good fit for something

00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:17,039
because nobody nobody wants to be

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,710
unhappy nobody wants to be unappreciated

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,409
at a company so the better that you can

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:25,619
get a handle on assessment the better

00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:26,879
off all your employees will be these are

00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:28,919
some of the assessment categories that

00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:31,019
we originally came up with so confidence

00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,269
code quality communication judgment and

00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:35,309
technical knowledge judgment is a huge

00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:37,320
one especially in junior engineers and I

00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,440
wish I had some sort of objective scale

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,150
for measuring that but I don't

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,640
communication in comm

00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,930
are also really big and then code

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,220
quality and technical knowledge are

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:52,640
actually only two of the five that we

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:54,080
came up with okay so that is my overview

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,820
of technical onboarding training and

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,260
mentoring the main takeaways are that

00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,420
onboarding aims to make people

00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,610
productive independent and confident it

00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,740
benefits everyone in the long run the

00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:06,230
individual the company the company's

00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,300
bottom line the team and it also is

00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:11,059
really helpful for diversity and anyone

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,500
can be involved in onboarding so however

00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:13,880
many people you have on your team no

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,480
matter what level of seniority they can

00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,160
all be involved in training I for a

00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,980
company called run scope and we have

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,679
these cool t-shirts so if you want one

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,660
you can come find me we build dev tools

00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,720
to help people inspect their feelings

00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:34,490
I'm kidding it's it's dead

00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:37,240
I wish really awesome it's dev tools to

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,860
help people inspect their API requests

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,450
so anyways if you want a t-shirt

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,850
you should come find me because the

00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:46,160
t-shirts are pretty funny and thank you

00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:49,190
so much I think there's two minutes for

00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,350
questions there's also a repo on github

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,720
that has some of this information I need

00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,700
to update the slides but it has some

00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,770
assessment categories and how you can

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,290
think about assessment people based on

00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,900
all of the things that I mentioned and

00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:05,200
you can also tweet at me if you feel

00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,200
like it

00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,240
you

00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,100
