Hashes are very useful for labeling little bits of data. But do you know how cool they really are? For instance, whether a hash has 10 keys or 10 million doesn't change how long it takes to find the key you're looking for.

How does that work? I'll show you! We'll build our own hash class in Ruby. I'll also show you that "Big O" analysis isn't scary as we make our hash lean and mean.

Finally, we'll see what our hash can teach us about related topics, like programming languages and databases. Come ready to learn!
