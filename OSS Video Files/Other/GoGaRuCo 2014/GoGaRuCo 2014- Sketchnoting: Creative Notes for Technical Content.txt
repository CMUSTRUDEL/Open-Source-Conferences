Title: GoGaRuCo 2014- Sketchnoting: Creative Notes for Technical Content
Publication date: 2020-01-23
Playlist: GoGaRuCo 2014
Description: 
	By, Jessica Eldredge
As developers, most of our time is spent on computers and electronic devices; but sometimes good old-fashioned pen and paper is the best way to explore and develop our ideas. Sketchnoting combines hand-drawn elements and text to enhance focus, improve memory, and visualize important concepts. The practice of sketchnoting is not about the ability to drawâ€”it's about the ability to listen.

This talk will cover tools and techniques to visually capture ideas, how to approach the mental multitasking required to sketch during technical talks and meetings, and why "I can not draw" is just a mental barrier to embracing creativity in your notes.

hello my name is Jessica Eldridge I'm a

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,220
front-end developer at Shopify and I

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,220
want to talk to you today about taking

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,699
notes more specifically how to take

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,699
awesome very cool notes by practicing

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,579
something called sketchnoting so what is

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,200
sketchnoting it's basically visual

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,149
note-taking it's the practice of

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,149
combining hand drawn elements and text

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,620
to create visually compelling notes if

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,870
you're familiar with something like mind

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,309
maps if you've ever used a whiteboard to

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,620
draw things out while designing software

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,670
you're already kind of gotten a head

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,410
start on sketchnoting basically it's the

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,010
difference between more traditional

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,890
looking notes like this and notes like

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,870
this I actually did listen to this talk

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,170
two times to get that example for you I

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,570
know nothing about Ruby cryptography but

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,619
hopefully this looks like like I know

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,000
what I'm talking about I got into

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,400
sketchnoting because of a man named

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
micro D I was preparing to go to South

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,189
by Southwest one year and I was looking

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,270
at stuff on the internet trying to get

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,340
an idea of what I was getting myself

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,890
into and I came across this Flickr

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,900
stream and he had these amazing notes

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,369
and I you know kind of went down this

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,909
rabbit hole checking out these photos

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,500
and I said I really got to try this so I

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,020
started doing it at meetups and at

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,729
conferences Mike Brody coined the term

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,439
sketchnoting by the way he does a lot of

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,950
podcasts and like really promotes the

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,780
practice so I took my hand at trying at

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,000
these I dug up my very first sketch

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,649
notes at that South by Southwest that I

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,090
went to and it's kind of funny because I

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,549
knew nothing about Ruby on Rails at the

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,280
time but my first sketch notes were

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,460
actually a talk by DHH so I think that

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,719
is kind of funny there's a couple

00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,399
different ways you can do sketch notes

00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,640
you can do them live or you can do them

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,219
later

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,600
live sketchnoting means taking them at

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,939
the same time that the content is being

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,250
presented and later sketch notes you

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,869
might write them down on scratch pads or

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,520
take bulleted notes or type them up and

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,250
then you go

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,080
later and put them into a sketchbook I'm

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,120
a developer and I like to keep things

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,340
dry so I prefer a live sketch noting

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,110
because when the talk is done my notes

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,720
are done and I don't have to go back and

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,150
I can concentrate on the next thing so a

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,530
lot of the stuff I'm going to talk about

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,610
today is gonna focus on live

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:33,130
sketchnoting techniques you can also use

00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,960
different mediums for sketchnoting

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:39,650
Veronica herb is sketch noter she uses

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,600
pen and paper I really like how she has

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,960
created sort of this visual concept of

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,460
using these tags to highlight technical

00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,260
terms

00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,400
she Illustrated the concept of get

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,280
branching in two different ways to

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,410
really reinforce that concepts and she

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,290
always takes time to make her title area

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,320
and her speaker know it's very fun it's

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,900
really draw attention to that

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:07,130
Sasha schewe uses a tablet PC and a

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:10,790
sketchbook app on her PC she uses color

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,620
to highlight important concepts and kind

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,560
of reinforce this thought bubble by

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,540
literally drawing a thought bubble she

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,459
goes to a lot of technical talks and has

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,590
a lot of very dense content but using

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,920
those colors you can still pick out the

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,130
high points of of the talk you could

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,110
also use an iPad like Daniel Kirsch with

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,170
a smaller device you're gonna have to

00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,760
have more concise notes I love that he

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,790
used the pops of color and really

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,300
simplified stick figures to illustrate

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,190
you know there's three concepts on this

00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,330
thing I can barely read the type but I

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:50,270
think it says nope I don't even know

00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:53,120
everyone everyone starts agile and gets

00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,010
stuck inspiration often comes from fresh

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,360
perspectives that's what it says and

00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,890
that makes a license so why am I talking

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,300
about sketchnoting why might a ruby

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,360
CaRMS trying to tell you guys how to

00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,160
take notes firstly I think we can find a

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,010
lot of inspiration and analog processes

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,239
we are all developers even as people I

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,100
mean we're in San Francisco we spend a

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,980
lot of time on electronic devices it's

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,989
our comfort zone but taking the time to

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,270
get away from the computer and do

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,700
something different may bring up fresh

00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:25,170
ideas as you're doing something new you

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,570
might think of new new

00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,890
clarifying ideas just trying something

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,860
and slowing down a bit

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,480
some famous people that used sketching

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,510
to enhance and clarify their ideas

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:41,190
include Leonardo da Vinci Sigmund Freud

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:44,280
Darwin and Kurt Vonnegut sketching also

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,020
helps you to focus I know a lot of you

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,280
are probably you bring your laptops to

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,720
meetings and how many of you guys are

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,200
actually taking notes when you're in a

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,510
meeting

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,830
you're probably checking I am you might

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,970
be checking emails somebody's pinging

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,080
you because something's going down in

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,440
production and you got to fix it right

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,900
now

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,730
we've got two rows of people here with

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,620
laptops plugged in and half of you're

00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,169
probably on Twitter right now but

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,020
basically you know the computers are

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:09,419
rabbit hole of distractions and using

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,220
more traditional especially if you're

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,300
doing pen and paper you've got if you

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,220
really have to focus you're

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,960
concentrating on what's happening and

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,340
you're slowing down you can reflect on

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,000
the content that's being presented to

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,050
you and there's no distractions

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,940
sketching also helps to improve memory

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,520
there so that thing called the dual

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,470
coding theory proposed by Alan pie Bo

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,970
and basically it says that your brain

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,830
processes information in two different

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,840
ways it uses verbal and visual

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,220
information to help remember things and

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,720
if you use both of those at the same

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,460
time you're gonna increase your odds of

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,350
remembering things so as your

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,540
sketchnoting just the practice of using

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:45,960
imagery and text will help you recall

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,760
information later below a lot of that

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,290
stuff is just excuses you don't really

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,880
need a reason this is the main reason

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,010
why I sketch them cuz I really think

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,870
it's just fun it's a great icebreaker at

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,100
conferences people ask questions if

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,750
you're a little shy and don't want to

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,150
you know go up to people it's an awesome

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,530
way to do that I love doing it and I try

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:06,000
to find excuses to do it whenever I can

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,030
when I first start encouraging people to

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,290
take sketch notes this is the main

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,080
argument I hear back a lot of people say

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,260
I don't know how to draw I can't do that

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,490
I'm gonna prove you wrong

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:21,300
these simple shapes that you see up on

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:24,450
the slide circle a square triangle cloud

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,740
a line a dot and an arrow if you can

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,260
draw any of these things and you can

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,970
sketch note if you can't draw any of

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,040
these things I am willing to help you

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,600
practice come find me

00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,180
but basically you use these shapes in

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,050
combination to build other shapes and I

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,639
use boxes and lines to connect ideas so

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,669
in practice you can see in my sketch

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:51,860
notes I'm basically just using these

00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:54,110
very simple shapes and text we're all

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,470
developers we like sharing our tools and

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,240
our setup so this is mine I like to use

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,580
a uniball pen because it's really smooth

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,470
and glides very well on paper I have a

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,040
couple of backup pens for bolder notes

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,229
and I use like a shading marker in a

00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,350
warm gray that adds some like depth to

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:14,150
my notes I prefer to go for the pen and

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,639
paper out I want like a medium heavy

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,280
paper that won't bleed because I write

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,930
really heavily I know a lot of people

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,430
that also use grid papers so if you're

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,050
worried when you're first starting and

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,850
you can't keep your lines straight your

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:30,020
text is kind of crooked the grid paper

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:31,580
often helps people so now that we've

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,350
gotten all set up how do we do this and

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,320
to this I'm gonna turn to one of my

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,789
favorite poets Mary Oliver who wrote

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:41,000
instructions for living life pay

00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:42,830
attention be astonished tell about it

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,410
and when I was preparing for this talk I

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:50,060
thought holy that actually makes a

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:52,550
lot of sense for sketchnoting so paying

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,800
attention the first thing I tell people

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,800
is that sketching is not actually about

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,300
drawing at all it's about listening

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,250
you're required to use active listening

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,800
techniques to to pull information from

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,380
the presentation and basically active

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,940
listening is the practice of not only

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,620
hearing what somebody is saying but

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,350
confirming that you understand the

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,780
messaging in person usually this is like

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,440
you supposed to nod you say AHA yes I

00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,660
understand

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,700
and sketchnoting you're confirming or

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,789
your understanding by committing those

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:26,330
same things that you here's a paper this

00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:28,100
requires a lot of focus and and you know

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,900
you're not worrying as much about how

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,340
you're doing things as about the things

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,800
that you're ingesting from that from the

00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,110
content listening is different than

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,789
thinking you don't want to let your

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,640
opinions or your emotions and reactions

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,800
to the speaker's content cloud your your

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,840
notes a lot of times you might hear

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,760
things especially a tech

00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,290
conferences and you're asking questions

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,730
like why didn't they bring up such and

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,590
such you know what about this or I

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,630
disagree with this implementation and

00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,540
all of that is distracting you from

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,280
capturing notes so you know the the key

00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,170
is to try to capture and then react

00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,450
later you know you can always talk with

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,690
the speaker and and engage with them

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,580
another way that again all right

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,790
so follow the speaker and not the slides

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,290
in this day and age speakers often post

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,280
their slides like immediately after

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,750
their talk there's all these places

00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,820
where you can where you can upload your

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,860
content so you can always find that

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,060
stuff later you don't want to have to

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,290
write that down because it's already on

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,910
the internet but you've only got one

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,710
chance to be in the room with the

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,810
speaker whether it's at a meeting or at

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,000
a conference and capture how they're

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,320
presenting their work so the good stuff

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,120
is not gonna be on the slides it's gonna

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,310
be with the person that's that's telling

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,720
you things and some things to pay

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,360
attention to are the speaker's body

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,040
language their emotions as they're up on

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,570
stage a lot of times people will start

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,950
getting really excited when something is

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,900
important maybe they'll get really angry

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,460
and start ranting about something that's

00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,140
when your ears should start perking up

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,130
and you're thinking maybe I want to

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,630
capture this so I talked a little bit of

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,250
active listening earlier and especially

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,500
with live sketchnoting it's really hard

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,240
to figure out how to filter information

00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,440
and it's really tempting when you're

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,630
first starting to try to summarize

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,550
everything somebody's saying and it's

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,350
virtually impossible to write as fast as

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,910
somebody can speak if anyone in this

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,770
room can do it please like I'd love to

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,470
talk to you because I've tried and it

00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:14,110
doesn't really work so you've got to

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,760
learn how to filter and the first step

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,170
to doing that is looking at the title of

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,870
the talk sometimes that will give you a

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,010
hint as to what's going to be important

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,420
sometimes speakers are really nice and

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,520
summarize what they're going to cover at

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,780
the beginning of the talk and but you

00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,760
can't always count on that because every

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,290
talk is different and basically what I

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,400
like to tell people is if you weren't

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,110
taking notes right now what would you

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,160
tweet about and those are the things

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:39,060
that you should capture in your notes so

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,460
the slides a little purse prescriptive

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,530
it's more of a suggestion live coding is

00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,810
challenging at technical conferences

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,880
there's a lot of demos when I first

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,240
started sketching noting I tried to

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,640
literally draw code and it's very hard

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,920
it also doesn't make your notes all that

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,550
interesting because

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,870
it's code so instead if you do want to

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,690
sketch note while somebody's doing a

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,610
demo if they're gonna do any live coding

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,980
I suggest listening for kind of the gems

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,839
of advice a lot of times you know we're

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,160
talking about pros and cons you know why

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,230
would I do this oh this didn't work

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,600
because those are some of the things I

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,180
capture anytime somebody mentions a

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,649
library or a plug-in or a ruby gem that

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,660
I'm not familiar with I'll take a note

00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:24,449
of that and kind of like make a mental

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,949
note to go back and look it up but

00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:28,320
sometimes it's also just okay to not

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:31,769
sketch note and sit back and watch the

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,300
cool stuff happen live right you can

00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:35,250
also use post-it notes to help you

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,839
retain information a lot of this again

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,519
people are speaking very quickly and

00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,899
you're trying to take notes I like to

00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,550
keep a little scratch pad off to the

00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,250
side to help me like serve cache

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,529
information for for a second until I can

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,449
get back to it usually in talks there

00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:50,130
are lulls between main points and that's

00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:53,070
a really good opportunity to go back and

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,870
fill in your notes you can hold on to a

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,220
thought and use that time to use your

00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:00,360
arrows and your boxes to make

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,970
connections so you also need to be

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,560
astonished and what does that mean and

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,390
that means spending the time to capture

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,709
what stands out to you you may share

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,390
these notes that people share them with

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,680
the speaker afterwards but ultimately

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,120
what's important is what you're gonna

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,829
remember and how you're gonna remember

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,440
it so you don't have to capture

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:18,060
everything I really got anxious at first

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,589
about being super accurate and you know

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,089
my interpretations of the notes that you

00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:23,370
know if the speaker didn't intend for me

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:25,019
to do that but I've learned to let that

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,660
go because I need to focus on

00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,220
remembering what was important to me so

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,959
I listen to what's being said and I try

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,670
to interpret in my own way sometimes I

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,949
add little notes of my own to help me

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,920
remember and I skip the parts that don't

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:39,870
interest me

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,819
so Carol in school did some sketch notes

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,500
at Brooklyn betta last year I was also

00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:46,019
there when she went to this talk by Tim

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,410
O'Reilly she's a wonderful illustrator

00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,480
lots of content here I went to the exact

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,339
same talk and these are my sketch notes

00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,810
so it's really fascinating how you can

00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,160
compare you know two different

00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,600
experiences well we're about the same

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,190
talk but we came away with two different

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,949
things another thing to pay attention to

00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:07,890
jokes quotes and f-bombs you know

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:09,300
anytime a speaker starts cursing onstage

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,950
I don't know I think it adds some

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,380
labour gets the audience laughing it's

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,850
something that you remember you know

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,800
maybe it's 10 a.m. and somebody's

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:21,300
talking about poop you know it's a good

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,820
thing to capture in your notes I often

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,890
listen to quotable moments again like if

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,480
a speaker is taking a dramatic pause if

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,100
they start getting really excited or

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,839
angry about something

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,700
anytime they mentioned metaphors or

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,120
similes those are great opportunities to

00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,230
try to visualize information

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,170
so this talk looked like it was a lot of

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,500
fun can really get the energy and these

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,850
in these notes another thing that will

00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,560
help you is to create your own visual

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,470
language to kind of jog your memory

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,170
later so maybe you always want to pull

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,019
out quotes into boxes or use quotation

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,899
marks to call them out maybe you use a

00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,279
question mark to indicate when you have

00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,829
questions that you want to look up later

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,959
during a talk I listen to a podcast or

00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:05,370
one woman used to always draw an icon of

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,510
a book next to titles that were

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,010
mentioned and talks so that she

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,810
remembered what to go and like download

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:14,149
onto her Kindle later which I thought

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:16,560
was very cool so Eva lot of LEM is

00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,060
illustrating she uses quote marks in

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,829
different ways all of these are kind of

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,740
indications that there are direct quotes

00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:24,990
happening during the talk and sometimes

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,520
you'll be in a talk and you everything's

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,320
over your head and you still don't get

00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:34,140
it and that's okay too because there's

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,910
always a back-up plan for that so the

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,260
third step is to tell about it and I

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,779
really encourage people to share their

00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,390
notes it can be a little nerve-racking

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,820
at first but my preferred medium is

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,050
Twitter I always use the appropriate

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,120
hashtag for the meet-up for the

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,880
conference and I at mentioned the

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,399
speaker there's a blog called sketchnote

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,959
army which takes user submissions but

00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,279
also looks on the internet for certain

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,690
hashtags like sketchnotes and they

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:00,000
feature them on the blog so it's a great

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,860
way to broadcast it's a really good way

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,160
to keep the conversation going after a

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,019
talk people like to engage and respond

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,610
you know a lot of retweeting and that

00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,810
kind of thing it's it's really nice you

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,430
know instead of just leaving the talk

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,190
and forgetting about it you know you can

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,180
keep it going

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,010
speakers will be grateful if you share

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,390
your notes and this is one of the main

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,790
reasons why I'm giving this talk right

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,390
now because I do not realize how much

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,580
people love seeing

00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,990
notes of their talk I started getting a

00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,760
lot of thank-yous on Twitter and

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,750
basically all of that active listening

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,460
stuff that I was talking about earlier

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,680
you're proving it when you share your

00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,300
notes with people you're saying I spent

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,220
the time so really focused I didn't get

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,410
on my computer I came and listened to

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,360
your talk and I wrote it down and and

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,940
it's a really great way to engage with

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,960
the speaker it's super thoughtful and a

00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,310
lot of times you'll end up capturing

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,650
things in your notes that the speaker

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,750
didn't even intend which is really cool

00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,070
so it's a it's a way to say thank you

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,690
and it's another way to keep the

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,810
artifacts going after a meeting or a

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:58,210
talk and people will be wowed

00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,710
I have zero data to back this up so

00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:04,540
somewhere Asia ham really is probably

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:06,820
frowning at me but it's your notes are

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,710
gonna be more interesting and you know

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,600
odds are if you're in a meeting there's

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,360
probably not anybody else taking such

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,190
notes so you know doing this adds to the

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,600
diversity and the types of information

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,160
that you're processing you know you

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,390
could have a whiteboard session going

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,440
and somebody else is taking pen and

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,840
paper notes and then you've got the

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,070
typed notes and this entire pool of

00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:28,740
notes will help people recall

00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:30,820
information so I've talked a lot about

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,530
conceptually how to sketch note but

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,420
there are some practical tips that I can

00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,680
share with you

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,630
and one of them is just get comfortable

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,160
I always get to a talker of meeting

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,930
early so I can prepare with the

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,660
speaker's name and the title and kind of

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:46,090
just get my setup going find a good

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,710
light source a lot of times conference

00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,390
rooms will be kind of dimmed down so I

00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:52,030
try to find something where I can you

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,930
know at least see what's on my lap and

00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,120
you want to sit where you won't be

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,460
interrupted I used to sit on the aisle

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,900
because I liked the extra elbow room the

00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,640
problem with the aisle seats is that you

00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,050
have to get up and sit down and get up

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,790
and sit down every time somebody needs

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,459
to come in so now I sort of stick to the

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,920
middle but I'm still a jerk and I leave

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,079
my bag on the seat next to me so I can

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,880
have some elbow room and I feel really

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:17,050
bad conference organisers I'm sorry but

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:20,170
I need my space so the other thing I can

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:22,839
tell you to slow down I gave this talk

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,610
to my colleagues at work and someone

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,440
mentioned that they have really crappy

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,760
handwriting so it's like how am I gonna

00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,280
make beautiful notes if I have really

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,960
shitty handwriting and my advice is to

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,640
slow down and to really write your

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,080
letters as if you're drawing them this

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,630
might mean that you're not going to

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,330
capture

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,160
much information but that's okay also

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,530
drawing larger letters amazing

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,690
counterintuitive but writing bigger will

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,190
force you to slow down and so therefore

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:51,140
your handwriting will end up looking a

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:52,760
lot nicer also play with layouts um you

00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,320
know it's really easy to kind of just go

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,080
top-down if you've got a vertical page

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,670
in front of you but you know switching

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,200
it up and trying different things you

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,660
know you can go vertical or you can try

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,360
to do columns or sort of a winding

00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,370
left-to-right path or maybe you start in

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,010
the middle and mindmap out and just

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,630
started bubbling this information so a

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,740
good way to experiment and try something

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:17,030
different and get out of your comfort

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:18,440
zone again so some examples of different

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,850
layouts you know this is sort of more of

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,200
a radial thing with the title in the

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:25,610
middle and all the concepts around and

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,530
column notes are actually really good

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,540
for panels so it's like an opportunity

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,130
to sort of list the each speaker on a

00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,430
panel at the top and then capture the

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:38,690
key points that that each person spoke

00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:41,120
about adding the decoration laughs is

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:44,150
also really important you know your

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,100
first goal is to capture information so

00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,470
writing down as much as you can and then

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,360
using the lulls or maybe immediately

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,400
after the talk to connect to ideas

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,410
together and add boxes and shading and

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,210
whatever you might need to do it's also

00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,190
a nice way to sort of reflect on the

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,320
talk I will scan over at my notes and

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,460
say oh that was really nice I liked when

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,650
they talked about that so then I'll

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,670
spend a little bit more time

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:08,870
embellishing that area making sure like

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:10,250
that stands out for me and also it's

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,260
important especially with lights got

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,300
sketchnoting to embrace mistakes because

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,970
you're gonna make them there are some

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,890
things you can do to you know kind of

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,500
bring your own backup plan like a bold

00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,210
marker to cover things up but you know

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,160
in the end I really advise just being

00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,170
okay with scratching out notes and and

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,170
leaving them you know warts and all in

00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:32,900
my notes you know I take sketch notes

00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:35,000
and often I'll get smudges when I'm you

00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,230
know using it and sometimes I spelled

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,910
words wrong so I try to spell

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,040
entrepreneurs I didn't work so I blocked

00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,440
it out I tried to spend I can spell it

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,270
again it still didn't work so it took me

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,070
three tries and I just you know let's

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,070
you've got him gotta live with it

00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,029
and as with anything practice makes

00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:55,369
better one good way to practice

00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:58,340
sketchnoting is to use things like

00:19:55,369 --> 00:20:01,279
confreaks TED Talks using meetings at

00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,749
work podcasts the nice thing about

00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,309
watching videos or listening to a

00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:06,080
podcast is that it takes the pressure

00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:08,029
off of live sketchnoting so you can

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,549
pause and make sure you're capturing

00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:12,379
things it also will give you an idea of

00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:15,950
how fast you can capture information and

00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:17,690
how much I used to take two pages in my

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,029
sketchbook for every talk no matter the

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:23,059
length and now I've got it down to one

00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:24,590
and I sort of you know any talk about an

00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:25,940
hour-long I can get in one page and

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,159
that's all that process of sort of

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:32,359
filtering and just practicing and seeing

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:34,519
you know what's really important also

00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:38,809
it's just kind of fun I'm watch movies

00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:40,999
and and taking notes great and Berman

00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:47,450
did some beautiful sketch notes of

00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:49,100
Glengarry Glen Ross and you know when

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,450
you're first learning anything one of

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,929
the best ways to learn is to literally

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,700
copy somebody's style right and so go do

00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:58,039
that you know get inspired look on the

00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,989
internet and find somebody that draws in

00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:03,019
a way that you like and steal their

00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:04,700
style and then go look some more and

00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:06,529
steal somebody else's style and layer it

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,970
into your sketches and at the end as you

00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:10,190
experiment you've created something

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,720
that's totally unique to you which is

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,369
basically an amalgamation of other

00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:18,739
people's styles some places to find

00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:20,539
inspiration are Flickr Pinterest

00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:21,529
sketchnote army was the blog that I

00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:23,929
mentioned before

00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:26,659
Scott Torrance recently released this

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,340
ebook it's free on iTunes and it's

00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:30,019
literally what it says it is it's a

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,609
hundred and forty sketch notes uh by

00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:32,989
various people and it's just nothing but

00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:37,429
sketch notes there's no words it's just

00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:39,080
pictures micro D wrote this sketchbook

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,879
handbook he actually just released a

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,220
second version which is more of a

00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:45,379
workbook and more advanced techniques it

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,059
covers a lot more actual exercises and

00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:49,159
goes into more depth than the tips that

00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:52,309
I gave you here today but I highly

00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,570
recommend it it's super good so at the

00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,169
end of this talk you might be telling me

00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,680
a Jess

00:21:54,169 --> 00:22:01,110
I still can't draw and you are right

00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,370
but you can't sketch them and I hope you

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,370
will thank you

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,660
you

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,640
