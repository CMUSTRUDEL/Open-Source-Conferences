Storage gets cheaper every year and as a result many folks are turning into data hoaders. Maybe your current project has gigabytes or even terrabytes of data sitting in storage. Perhaps some has used the words "big data", "data mining", or "personalized experience" as an excuse to keep paying the storage bills.

Do you actually look at that data? How often do you use it? Is it really worth keeping it around? Do you know what questions it can answer?

In this talk I'll discuss how to use data to drive improvement and when to let it go. I'll focus not only on analysis tools, but also on interpretting data and how to decide if your data is valuable or clutter.
