00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,220
intro last time I opened up my talk

00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,480
first of all it's weird I don't know if

00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,980
Megan I had been formally reduced I just

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,670
moved to Boulder last week too very

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,350
weird so anyway uh I opened my talk last

00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,550
time talking about this anecdote of

00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,320
meeting Bill Nye when I was like 13

00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,870
years old Bill Nye the Science Guy and

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,100
how he had told me he was friends with

00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,450
my dad we were hanging out and he said

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,040
Peter he said I want you remember

00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,630
something for as long as you live and he

00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,729
looked at me and he said don't ever ever

00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,999
ever get a job he said it's not worth it

00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:09,859
and I talked about I've worked less than

00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:13,579
six months of my adult life since then

00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:14,719
I'm very proud of this and follow up

00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,939
what a bill and I say when you talk to

00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,159
him you met Bill Nye and you told told

00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,659
him that he was responsible for an

00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,369
eco-terrorist going to prison or

00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:26,119
something how did that go yeah so so

00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:29,240
Annika and i went to a filming of the

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,009
soup and it was like their end of the

00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,780
year let's invite all our friends over

00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,850
bill nye was one the random guess I was

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,409
like oh my god who you know what are the

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,630
odds I've got to tell him Peter story

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:40,249
and as we're like he left before us and

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,439
I was relieving he was like we got stuck

00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:44,929
in the elevator with him and his wife

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,869
and I was like oh my gosh 30 seconds um

00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:49,909
there's this guy who you knew his dad in

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,479
Seattle and you told him never get a job

00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:55,009
and then he later turned into this like

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,780
eco-terrorists FBI fugitive and then

00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:59,270
went to jail all because you or

00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,920
something like that and he was like that

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,509
doesn't sound like advice I gave I

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,979
probably told him to own the

00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,719
distribution I was like no no you told

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,130
him not to have a job oh listen my

00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,479
memory is very clear on this bill nye

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,959
told me to never work for another man

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,670
again any case so i'm not gonna get my

00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,200
whole talk again but that was actually

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,640
very central to my story this sort of

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,660
turning point where Bill Nye corner

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,400
me right so my last talked my talk last

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,930
time was fundamentally about being a

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,630
fugitive which is kind of a metaphor for

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,370
collapse in that I when you become a

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,720
fugitive you flee from the FBI you're

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,240
forced to start from scratch you're

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,530
supposed to take on a new name leave all

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,820
your old friends behind you can't call

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,380
your parents you're starting completely

00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,800
from scratch and that's what I had to do

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,660
I live that way for eight years and this

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,280
was because I was fleeing animal

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,230
enterprise terrorism charges this is an

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,000
actual charge and I was on the run for

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,800
like I said eight years for what we did

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,380
in 1997's we went to a series of fur

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,300
farms we cut fences we open the cages we

00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,970
released those mink into their native

00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,590
habitat we did that six times we were

00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,780
subsequently charged for those 64 farm

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,390
raids on behalf of the animal abrasion

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,150
front and I was looking at a maximum of

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:07,489
82 years in federal prison so I soberly

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,840
assess the situation I said I've got a

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,100
lot of life left in me and I'm going to

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,330
fight for the life the government is

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,890
trying to take away from me so I went on

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,630
the run was on the run for eight years I

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,459
was eventually caught in 2005 and

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,860
sentenced to two years in prison and

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,360
then involved getting a new ID I had i

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,489
lived in abandoned houses there was a

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,040
number of ways that being a fugitive

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,570
defined my life for a very long time and

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,370
what was really cool about the last talk

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,910
that I gave at farm app conference 3 was

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,070
that I was told by lawyers very firmly

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,209
to never ever talk about those years as

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,100
a fugitive because there could be

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,900
serious legal repercussions and I

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,220
eventually decided I'm going to talk

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,480
about it anyway and so it was kind of my

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,920
coming-out talked last time it was

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,269
really good to get that stuff off my

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,769
chest and stuff I've never been able to

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:47,410
talk about before I was never even

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,670
legally allowed to admit that I'd ever

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,890
knowingly evaded the law that in of

00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,040
itself can be a crime so that's what

00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,570
last time was for me but I'm going to

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,950
talk about right now real quick you have

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,950
to ruthlessly time check me except a lot

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,180
to talk about so I I talked about being

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,500
a fugitive what I didn't talk about its

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,329
have really been a fugitive three times

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,560
in my life I told you the first time the

00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,540
second time was when I got out of prison

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,340
I was told that I could never talk about

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,959
the years while I was a fugitive so I

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,760
was around nothing but people when they

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,170
bring up you know where were you in 1998

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,579
I couldn't talk about it for legal

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,570
reasons so it was almost like being on

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,850
the run all over again with a different

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,560
for a different time frame but when I

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,120
want to talk about is it part I couldn't

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,190
talk about in my last talk which is sort

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,349
of how I felt like I've become a

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,760
fugitive for the third time in the years

00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:30,320
since I got a prison I got a prison in

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,500
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,970
and it's it's another kind of fugitive

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,800
status I've endured with another kind of

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,960
clean break and starting new and I'm

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,090
talking about fleeing this sort of sub

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,550
cultural confines that I had been in for

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,110
so many years identified as sort of a

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,880
cliche radical which is something I

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,590
never identified with in a lot of ways I

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,330
was forced to conform to this it's

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,590
really interesting if you get a lot of a

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,290
social incentive for something like

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,270
being in bands how you can find reasons

00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,860
to be in bands for your entire life well

00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,930
into your you know 40s and 50s and

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,490
beyond or if you get known for something

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,410
as trivial as being a dumpster diver as

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,910
I was for a long time that you can find

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,370
reasons to continue being a dumpster

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,060
diver even long after those tactics that

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,470
lifestyle is stop serving you and I

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,540
think the best way to describe this and

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,220
this in to capture this is as an

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,830
anecdote from prison i went to i was in

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,960
jail in downtown chicago and i walked in

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,420
this jail is a really bad jail and I was

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,740
there for like a couple months and it's

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,450
the first day I got there this guy sat

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,590
down wanted to play chess with me so we

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,120
played chess at the end of the chess

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,960
game and everyone's looking at me

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,220
because they're all trying to feel me

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,290
out and test me out and see what kind of

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,850
guy I am he goes to fist bump me

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,170
actually I need a volunteer will you

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,210
come with real quick I'm sorry so the

00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,440
guy so he says good game man and he'd

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,910
kill me in chess and he's a good game

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,070
and he puts his fist out so put your

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,480
fist out and I'm sitting there and the

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,800
whole room is looking at me and they're

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,880
gonna judge me based on what I do next

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,420
because they're all trying to scrutinize

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,520
me I didn't know what this was I didn't

00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,680
know what he was trying to do and i SAT

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,820
there and I went like this and I'm

00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,030
thinking what is this weird prison

00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,570
ritual and I go and the whole room

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,130
busted out laughing and I what what the

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,140
message here and what this said is that

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,410
I had gotten 27 years into my life and

00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,270
never fist-bumped anybody now I'm not

00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,320
saying that you should ever a goal

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,980
should be to be around a lot of people

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,110
that fist bump in a non ironic way but

00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,180
what was really telling when I look at

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,960
the story is that i had was so deep in

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,340
my subculture ulm it's that I had never

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,230
fist-bumped in my life I was 27 years

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,150
old I was so deep in the punk rock

00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,430
subculture that I didn't even know what

00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,780
was what that was it's staggering to me

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,650
to think about now a lot of the years

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,910
since I feel like I've been trying to

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,600
break away from that and diversify my

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:43,000
life a little bit so how am i doing

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,090
Shane I ok so I got a prison and

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,470
everything

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,000
kinda crystallizes need for me to

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,220
diversify my life kind of crystallized

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,230
the need for me to get out of my punk

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,820
rock subculture and diversify things

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,530
when I went does anyone here know who

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,199
Anthony Robbins is I think a lot of us

00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,580
do Tony Robbins the kind of the

00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,370
archetypal like the cliche motivational

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,600
speaker when I got a prison I read some

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,370
of material in prison I found it very

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,990
useful and when I got out of prison he

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,400
was speaking at long beach like

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,750
convention center so I mean my friend

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,160
went down there we found a hatch in the

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,479
service hallway and we would look down

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,400
we were on the scaffolding that went

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,100
above the entire seminar the seminar was

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,810
twenty two hundred dollars okay it was

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,729
limited like 500 people we gotten up in

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,190
the scaffolding wound our way up four

00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:23,210
stories up above this crowd of 500

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,650
people you should pay two thousand

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,810
dollars to be there and we position

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,400
ourselves right above this stage I spent

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:34,190
two days at the seminar and I got more

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,229
true and I got more out of those two

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,110
days watching the so-called cliche

00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:41,090
motivational speaker then every punk

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,060
rock song I'd ever listened to combined

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,770
more practical useful actionable advice

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,270
and I'd ever gotten from any punk rock

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,789
song now no offense any the lyric

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,660
writers here who's lyric you know

00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:55,310
records I may or may not have listened

00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,780
to in high school but what was

00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,970
interesting is it the punk rock scene

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,740
that I came out of told me to not look

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,630
outside of itself that people like

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,770
Anthony Robbins a rich white guy telling

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,620
you how to live your life and this is

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,270
you know it it enforced militantly

00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,820
enforced not looking outside of itself

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,410
and I got so much value out of this

00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,919
anthony robbins speech the so-called

00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,840
cliche motivational speaker that that

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,910
was a moment identify as sort of my me

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,370
making a break from my past and that i

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,930
needed to start looking outside of punk

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,340
rock scenes and the punk rock lyrics and

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,220
seeing what else was out there exposing

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,360
myself to new knowledge so i began to

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:34,190
recognize the limitations of the

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,080
subculture that i came out of and this

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,709
kind of came to a head recently I sort

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,599
of think about a lot of my

00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:39,890
contemporaries that came out of the

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,750
subculture I came out of where you call

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,240
it punk rock or you know radical

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,010
whatever and how most of them are doing

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,990
the exact same thing they were doing 15

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,640
years ago it's people like Shane who

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,870
actually took the best parts of that

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,850
subculture and did something great with

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,560
it and build something cool by large a

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,720
lot of the people i know from that era

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,889
are taking this to the grave they

00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,420
are taking mediocrity

00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,739
to the grave and I don't think

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,209
there's anything to be proud of but for

00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:04,549
a long time I was very proud of the fact

00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,959
that I was I was I was staying within

00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:08,290
these very rigid boundaries and I

00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,459
thought I had a lock on the truth and

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,109
you know i look back come on the Anthony

00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:13,220
Robbins seminar sort of a moment where I

00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:14,899
realized you know there's more out there

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:22,249
than what I've been told in the punk

00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:26,089
rock subculture one minute okay so where

00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:27,859
my notes here I was recently walking in

00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,119
barnes & noble I found a magazine I look

00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,949
at the cover it's ink magazine a

00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:32,540
business magazine I NC and I see a

00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:34,189
friend of mine in the cover girl who was

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,869
an anarchist girl from Olympia I knew

00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:38,239
ten years before she was a rabid

00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:40,549
shoplifter perhaps she was a just like a

00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:42,679
classic anarchist girl on the cover this

00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:44,480
magazine she's worth 200 million dollars

00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:46,009
she is a I don't say her name I don't

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,299
think she wants the association with an

00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,709
eco-terrorist so I will leave her name

00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:50,809
out of this but we go way back and we

00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:52,609
know talking on the phone recently asked

00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,889
her I said you ever talk to any of those

00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:57,019
people from back in the day and she said

00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:58,279
you know I try he said but she said but

00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:00,019
every single one of them is doing the

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,519
exact same thing they were doing 15

00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:05,600
years ago and I i we don't have anything

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,980
to talk about and fast forward smash cut

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,749
24 hours i was talking another friend of

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,579
mine who was a fixture on our local punk

00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:12,049
rock scene and i asked him what he was

00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:13,819
up to and we were playing catch-up he

00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:16,850
was building a house out of stolen

00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:18,169
pallets on squatted property plane in a

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,089
punk rock band going on tour playing to

00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:21,829
30 people every night which would be

00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:23,299
cool I'm principally very down with that

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,100
but that was exactly what he was doing

00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:28,369
15 years ago and I juxtaposed those two

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,379
phone calls and I realized how in a lot

00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:34,449
of ways I become a fugitive from from

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,449
the confines of that era so i will close

00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:40,009
by saying let's all figure out how we

00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:41,089
can accelerate our own collapse we

00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,139
should not be doing the same thing we

00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,610
were doing 10 years ago we should not be

00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:46,489
doing the same thing we did three years

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,369
ago and let's all figure out how we can

00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:50,419
reinvent ourselves and become reborn

00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:52,149
take the best parts of what we learned

00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:54,470
and parlay that there's something big

00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:55,669
you know I then to my talk last time

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,980
like I'll end it now which is you know

00:10:55,669 --> 00:11:00,079
the best lives go to those who break the

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,309
most rules and it was a friend of

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,230
society's rules but I'm also referring

00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:04,339
to the rules of your contemporaries and

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,199
the people around you so start with

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,389
society's rules then break the rules of

00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:10,069
your subculture and whatever you do you

00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:11,630
know if it's been done before then it's

00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:15,130
probably not worth

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,130
so thank you

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,690
