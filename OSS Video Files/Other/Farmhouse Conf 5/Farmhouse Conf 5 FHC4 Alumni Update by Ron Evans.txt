Ron is going to go first full disclosure

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,820
Ron is a part of the hybrid group the

00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,010
hybrid group has sponsored every one of

00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,340
these things that's not why he's

00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,560
speaking here he's hugging me because

00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:24,369
he's he's paid a lot of money for that

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:28,300
hug it's because this is a thing worth

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:31,449
doing thanks buddy so Ron gave a talk

00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,550
last time at future about some robots it

00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:37,480
looks like he's pulled a bag out with

00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:39,969
some visual aids are they're robots yes

00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,050
okay so last time was future and I was

00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:44,440
like you can't talk about the future

00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,989
without like robots so he brought him

00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,890
out we played he played a game of the

00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:53,920
game of life with some little robot

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,989
spiros and he's going to give us a five

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,449
minute Jim I want to go yeah definitely

00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,579
time this cut me off Eli's gonna time it

00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:02,109
I want to go nicely asked some skaters

00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:06,900
to be quieter because I could hear him

00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:10,030
out there have fun hi everybody so

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,009
recently I came back from New York City

00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,630
where I was an attendee at the dark

00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:18,640
conference which was the drone and

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,340
aerial robotics conference it was the

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,570
first global conference that brought

00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:27,460
together technologists business academia

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,380
journalists activists and government all

00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,210
together in one place to talk about this

00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,939
new industry except for one small

00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,070
problem due to the government shutdown

00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:39,040
none of the representatives from NASA

00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:42,640
the National Oceanic and the Space

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,460
Administration the FCC FAA none of them

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,259
were able to attend unfortunately we

00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,390
talked about doing a little collection

00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,979
to raise the money to fly them in then

00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:56,770
we realized oh yeah we already did that

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:59,229
it's called taxes so it was a fantastic

00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,840
conference it brought together literally

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:03,909
on one extreme we have the Patrick Egan

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,619
who is one of the heads of the

00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:08,470
Association for unmanned vehicle systems

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:10,270
which is the main lobbying group he's

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,849
the silicon valley chapter president on

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,310
the other extreme we had the granny

00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,319
Peace Brigade which was a fantastic

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,540
group of

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,790
elderly individuals who had made a

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,049
fantastic scale-model replica of a

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,579
Predator drone that they were using

00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:27,090
outside as they were picketing and

00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:28,859
protesting the conference so it was

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,870
really quite interesting the first day

00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:33,090
there was a couple of panel discussions

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,250
one was called life under drones it was

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,840
moderated by terror mckelvey who is a

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,579
journalist at the BBC and one of the

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,099
particular people on that conference was

00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,319
a madea tyare who's an independent

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,540
journalist who has covered a lot of the

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,340
drone strikes that have taken place in

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,439
Pakistan and Afghanistan and has

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,930
interviewed a lot of the families and

00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,780
you know really brought a human side to

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,930
the techno filia as she put it that we

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,219
roboticists tend to have then right

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,980
after that was a conference called a

00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,469
right to drones and that was actually

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,150
moderate baleia rosen from the freedom

00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,219
of the press foundation and the

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,799
information Patrick Egan was one of the

00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:15,419
panelist members there so we really have

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,030
an enormous spectrum what was

00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,310
interesting about these people is that

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,889
none of them were really talking about

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,409
the same thing this term drone has come

00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:28,169
to represent a cultural identity outside

00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:30,930
of the robotics or outside of leave in

00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:32,099
the military in fact I spoke at some

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,439
length to the members of the granny

00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,989
Peace Brigade they were wonderful lovely

00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,120
people and really they were anti-war not

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,400
anti robot so let's let's throw that out

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,799
there anyway the keynote speaker with

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,419
Daniel Suarez the first night many

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,549
people have read some of his books he's

00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:51,000
a fantastic author he wrote a great book

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:54,030
called kill decision about kind of a

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,639
near future possibilities during his

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,519
keynote he called for an immediate

00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:02,879
international ban on autonomous robotic

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,389
air killing machines and he also called

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,150
for a system of indelible license plates

00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:11,579
on drones think about that for him in

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,090
the technologists the next day the

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,650
ending keynote was dr. Missy Cummings

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,659
dr. Missy Cummings as she was the first

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,699
female fighter pilot for the United

00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,500
States Navy and she is currently a

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,159
professor at the Massachusetts Institute

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,349
of Technology and I really wanted to ask

00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:30,060
dr. Cummings a question I wanted to ask

00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:32,220
her about what Daniels

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,990
as had mentioned the night before about

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,810
this international moratorium on

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,130
unmanned robotic illing machines

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,800
unfortunately I didn't get that

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,350
opportunity because another man got the

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,230
last question he was a man I had spoken

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,310
to he was sort of an activist who had

00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,590
penetrated the security of the

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,020
conference not really anybody can go in

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,180
they were really open he was really

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,370
impatient 'it but unfortunately not

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,110
especially articulate so he wasn't able

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,050
to ask the question that I wanted to ask

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,570
which was what do you think dr. Cummings

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,680
about the feasibility of this what do

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,660
you think about the feasibility of

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,889
having an indelible license plate the

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,050
thing that Daniel Suarez have been

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,470
concerned about was what's going to

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,630
happen when some non-governmental

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:19,139
organization takes some kind of

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,450
automated flying robot and uses it for

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,580
some kind of attack and then the

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,139
plausible deniability what government

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,250
was it maybe it was a government

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,220
claiming it with some outside

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,330
organization how will we even know the

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,520
potential for geo political

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,140
destabilization was the thing that he

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,610
was greatly concerned about and I

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,140
thought dr. Cummings might have

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,660
something to say on this subject being

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:43,050
that she was a military person as well

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,030
as a professor uh unfortunately didn't

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,410
get to ask that question about the

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,860
feasibility of having an indelible

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,780
license plate on drone technology those

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,600
of us who've ever spoofed IP addresses

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,010
no that's not going to happen so the

00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,979
last day of the conference was the

00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:01,350
hackathon none of the policy people

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:03,770
government people lawyers or any of the

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:08,400
other people were there at the New York

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:10,380
University's Institute of ITP known as

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,289
the Institute of the up until recently

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,110
impossible that was where we built

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,669
drones that drew graffiti literally

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,479
using the new graffiti markup language

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:24,090
standard the first rafidi drawing drone

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,430
was built there but none of these people

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,639
were there as we built this future that

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:33,600
they were so confirmed concerned about

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,660
that was the collapse thank you

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,660
you

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,919
