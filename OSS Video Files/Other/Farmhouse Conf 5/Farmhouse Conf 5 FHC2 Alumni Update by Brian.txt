up next with Brian Brian a so one more

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,590
circle to the Venn diagram who here

00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:16,520
would call themselves an anarchist fewer

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,990
of those but a few each done okay so I

00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,849
wish someone was actually drawing this

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,789
Venn diagram right sort of approximating

00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:25,359
the size of the circles yeah need more

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:29,390
diagrams explain it to me using a matrix

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:33,020
so Brian I don't know how to control

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,930
same deal old vegan strange friend from

00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,600
like the punk-rock days that we've kept

00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,030
in contact and sort of had these like

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,280
wildly divergent paths in our lives that

00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,540
managed to crisscross occasionally when

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,750
I was doing this thing I was like I've

00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:51,050
got to get Brian out here he's so sort

00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,450
of mean fun time like he was so off the

00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,840
map of what everyone else was there like

00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,510
what sort of in diagram love you know

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,030
that that iteration of the conference

00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,600
and I wanted that part of sort of my

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,159
story that you know that was that's I've

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,420
actually been pulling that this has sort

00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,329
of been two and a half years of

00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,130
performance art where I've been pumping

00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:17,149
you all into listening to things I care

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,880
about and sir so that's sort of what

00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:22,009
Brian was was like i need i need the

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,429
wing nut anarchist so I call it my boy

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:27,229
brothers and and he delivered so he was

00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:30,579
kind of to come back and do it one more

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,579
time thanks

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,110
so anarchism the the idea that everyone

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,420
deserves complete self-determination the

00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,270
opposition to oppression two people

00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,590
having power over each other the idea

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,610
that we shouldn't impose any kind of a

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,319
hierarchies or any kind of power

00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:57,579
differentials on people whether those be

00:01:53,319 --> 00:02:00,340
gender norms or white supremacy state

00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:02,200
power private property I sort of an

00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,640
outlier philosophy I see that not

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,439
everybody here believes that you would

00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,130
be better off without the NSA the police

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,739
department and so on but what reason do

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,890
you have to listen to me then if you are

00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:16,840
I'm guessing a computer programmer well

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,340
I'll recapitulate some of the arguments

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,709
that i made last time i was here and

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,450
maybe end with something even more

00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:28,390
useful than I did then first proponents

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,220
of radical social change are often

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,110
thinking further outside the box than

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,510
people who are trying to solve present

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,829
market challenges I'll give an example

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,660
of this it was in 1990s and the the way

00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:42,430
that media worked was top down and

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,299
unidirectional the money that was being

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:49,090
made was being made in television

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:51,400
newspapers I was part of an obscure

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,410
subculture that was making a more

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,850
radical demand the radical demand we

00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:00,010
were making was horizontality was a was

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,829
it we should be able to make media for

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,690
each other directly peer-to-peer now at

00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:06,790
the time this was a unusual thing to

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,470
demand and something that was ahead of

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,540
the curve now it doesn't sound radical

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,040
to y'all because the corporations that

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,280
have made new money in the last decade

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,200
and a half have made it off of providing

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:23,440
exactly this demand right our demand has

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:26,470
become totally sa actually now I can

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,989
last time I was here I told the story of

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,849
how this took place you can see this

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,319
taking place first of all the forms of

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,389
the new technologies the new social

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,400
media you can also tell the story in

00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:38,290
terms of the the personal histories of

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,540
many of the people who produce these my

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,360
example was Twitter which was originally

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,240
invented as text ma by anarchists for

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,330
social

00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,640
movement for social struggles right text

00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,640
mob was supposed to direct people in the

00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,640
streets to keep aware of police

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,010
movements and to be to be able to act

00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,860
collectively immediately autonomously

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,900
now we have twitter which enables us to

00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,350
do that only in some kind of weird

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,180
marketing behavior so we didn't exactly

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,530
win but the point is that we were ahead

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,480
of the curve in an interesting way so

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,270
when I concluded last time I tried to

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,130
identify what it was the anarchists now

00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:19,310
are talking about that might be of

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,320
interest heel and my my conclusion was

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,120
not as daring as it should have been it

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,640
was not radical enough you know I said

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,190
in an era of total connectivity what is

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,840
the what is the radical demand but an

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,210
extrapolating from my own experience in

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,610
the streets in street protest activity

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,370
where over the last decade and a half

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,920
we've seen what is sometimes called

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,960
black bloc activity become more and more

00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,260
common where people protest in a

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,430
completely anonymous form first you know

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,340
it's famous in the United States from

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,430
the Seattle WTO protests in 99 but this

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:55,040
year it's become instrumental in protest

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,780
movements in Egypt and now Brazil so

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,910
extrapolating from that I came here and

00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,250
I said the next radical demand is going

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,200
to be anonymity and unlimited is going

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,290
to be really important in a world of

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,240
total connectivity now fast forward

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,340
about a year later and the Snowden

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,600
revelations reveal that you know the

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,730
things that anarchists knew ten years

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,580
earlier actually about how the NSA is

00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,190
monitoring everybody I remember after

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,360
after I spoke last time somebody came up

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,880
to me and is like oh this is all very

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,270
interesting what do you imagine for a

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,100
business model when you grassed on the

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,230
anarchist for a business model actually

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,970
I'm anti-business an anti model this is

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:37,550
your problem you know and now today I'm

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,010
told that the investors in Silicon

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,570
Valley are scrambling right now to

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,080
figure out how to make money off of

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:47,090
everybody's desire for confidential

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,550
transfer of information so i have to

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,830
send a shout out to leap dot s you throw

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,080
up your hand if you know about this very

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,790
few people are actually prepared to

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,360
solve this problem go ahead and look up

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,800
I see if you have the opportunity may or

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,450
may not be ahead of the curve but the

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,150
point is that I only gave you all a year

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,880
warning if somebody had seen my speaking

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,110
of it and raced home and created you

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,080
know all the software that you needed

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,940
for complete computer confidentiality

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,650
then you would probably be making a lot

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,440
of Mike right now but I didn't give you

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,420
enough warning so I'm going to try to

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,750
think a little bit more radically about

00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:26,930
what could be most challenging for y'all

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,310
this is a visit me speaking a speaking a

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:32,540
little off-the-cuff a little bit more a

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,700
little more honestly I'm going to say

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,820
the social media technology that we have

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,620
today marginalizes people you know the

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,090
the idea is that it's supposed to

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,330
connect people in new ways in ways that

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,890
fulfill all of the radical demands that

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,270
we have the 1990s where we wanted to

00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,630
become the media you know where we

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,970
wanted to be the story but in fact in a

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:56,210
world where everyone everyone has an

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,100
iphone there are two kinds of

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,680
marginalization first not everyone has

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,160
an iphone second of all all of the kinds

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,600
of human relation that cannot take place

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,510
through those social media become

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,100
themselves marginalized we can see that

00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,700
this is happening position from where I

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:16,220
am in protest movements because every

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,750
aspect of human behavior and potential

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,210
that is marginalized in our society

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,400
appears in our movements appears in the

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,440
demands that people make so I'll give an

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,660
example this occupy wall street which

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,580
yell are familiar with ten years ago in

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,860
the social movements i was involved in a

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,180
protest movement based on permanent

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,460
physical presence would have been

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,900
unthinkable actually nobody would be

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,580
able to imagine that you would be able

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,660
to get everybody together in a park for

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,430
months right so in an era when you don't

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,580
have to go somewhere physically to do

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,290
something it seems ironic or unusual had

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,340
a protest movement based on permanent

00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:55,040
physical presence would become the most

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,350
famous protest movement of 2011

00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,760
I don't think it's unusual actually is

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,320
the people who were there were therefore

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,010
i'm going to i'm going to say two

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,600
reasons first because they wanted

00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,490
physical presence they wanted those

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,470
interactions all the interactions that

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,930
are pushed to the margins by our social

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:14,090
media and second there were a lot of

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,580
people who were there because in a

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,890
social media-based world not having

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,480
technological access means that they

00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,340
were already marginalized and they had

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,340
to be there in physical presence to be

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,920
able to participate so I'm going to

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,460
hypothesize that this was not the last

00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,320
such struggle that there are going to be

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,460
intensifying social struggles coming

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,130
from the ways that people are

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:40,300
marginalized and the question that I

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,890
want to pose to you creative productive

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,020
innovators of our age is what

00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,270
technologies are people in these

00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,280
movements going to need what

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,430
technologies are the marginalized point2

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:55,780
need over the summer when people

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:58,730
occupied guzzi park in istanbul and

00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,380
engaged in a you know a day's long

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,820
standoff with the government that spread

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,910
into conflicts all around the country

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,530
there was a mapping technology that they

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,290
used to keep up with events around the

00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:13,460
city but in in crisis situations like in

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:16,430
Egypt we can imagine the need not just

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,800
for you know minute by minute mapping

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,900
but actually technologies that would

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,750
enable people to totally transform their

00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,070
society he's there in an ongoing

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,080
struggle basically with the military

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,910
disguised as different governments right

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,010
so I'm going to pose this question to

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:34,040
y'all what technologies will the

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:38,030
marginalized and in the conflicts that

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,010
are going to erupt this uh this has to

00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:43,400
do a via Slee with collapse that those

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:45,260
who are not interconnected through the

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,960
kind of technologies that interconnect

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,610
you are already in a situation of

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,770
collapse the kind of collapse that is

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,630
going to be slowly taking place to

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,900
everybody who is not on the the

00:09:53,630 --> 00:10:00,380
shrinking tip of the iceberg of a

00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:03,320
sinking global capitalism is being a

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,610
mixed metaphor but you follow me so I'll

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,880
conclude with another metaphor a

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,940
historical metaphor in 1848 there was a

00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,250
revolution in France and februari and as

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,750
the news of this revolution arrived in

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,910
other cities around Europe there were

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,730
revolutions each of these sims actually

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,470
there's a wave of revolutions why did

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,330
this happen all of us well it happened

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,360
because poor people were suffering and

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,820
increasingly unsurvivable conditions it

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,370
happened because there was a new bull

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,020
Ozzy that had more social and economic

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,180
leverage than it had political power and

00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:40,340
it happened because of the in competence

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:42,800
of the rulers now it didn't create a day

00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,300
gala terrian society because as soon as

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,320
these revolutions kicked off the bush

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,520
wazee were like what do we do to

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,850
concentrate and preserve our own power

00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,740
and privilege how can we do that and

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:57,200
ultimately sabotage the revolutions

00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,500
leading to in many cases to another few

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,230
decades of monarchy okay fast forward to

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,730
2013 now there is a lot of suffering as

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,650
people other people have talked about on

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,260
this microphone there's also a class

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:12,410
that has disproportionate social and

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,180
economic leverage relatives to the

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,780
political system which is increasingly

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:20,960
dysfunctional that class is y'all

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:23,390
obviously and there is the in competence

00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,030
of our rulers and finally there is going

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,190
to be a collapse of the current ruling

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,590
order I can imagine two possible

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,470
consequences for this one is that

00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,810
programmers as a class do what they have

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,640
to to protect their privileges and to

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,980
concentrate power in new structures

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,020
people feel very good about themselves

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,240
and the ways that they concentrate power

00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,460
in their hands the other way that this

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,890
could play out is for people to side

00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,330
with the disenfranchised with the

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,430
marginalized with the marginalized

00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:55,300
aspects of ourselves and with the people

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,560
in our society who are marginalized and

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,290
this is what I'm hoping that you will do

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,730
as you work in the forms of innovation I

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,730
hope you thank you very much for this

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,800
you

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,149
