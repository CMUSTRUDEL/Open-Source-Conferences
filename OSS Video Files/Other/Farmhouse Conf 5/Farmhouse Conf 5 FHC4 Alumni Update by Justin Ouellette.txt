so Justin was originally signed up to

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,270
speak at farmhouse comp 3 1 year ago and

00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:19,210
about one year ago and one day ago a

00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:23,189
ginormous superstorm called sandy

00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:25,539
crushed into New York and he could if he

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,039
could have gotten to the airport his

00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:29,529
flights were still going but there was

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,480
no gas and no cars and no one would take

00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,250
any amount of money to take any amount

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:38,799
of gas into any amount of cars work so

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:41,320
we missed out on Justin at disruption

00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,729
instead we got him for future and he's

00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:52,659
been spelling his name without vowels

00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:54,489
way before it was cool jst in Thank You

00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:56,379
Shane and thank you for all this this is

00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,479
amazing I'm so happy to be back here at

00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:00,729
four I guess its last one right is that

00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,239
does that still it all good things must

00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:07,840
come to an end um I had another travel

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,210
adventure on my way here this time add

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,340
another adventure it was kind of an

00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:16,390
auspicious time to be flying into LAX

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:20,170
yesterday so i flew her from New York

00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,670
and as I was leaving my apartment I like

00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,890
I got this like news alert on my phone

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,760
and it said there's been a shooting at

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,860
LAX and I was like oh no like how is

00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:35,260
this horribly violent thing going to

00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:36,159
mildly inconvenience me and I didn't

00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,690
know who's going to happen like I

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,700
checked my flight and said some time

00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,530
everything's fine and I went to the

00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,820
airport and sure enough there was some

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,040
confusion about what to do there like

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,830
there might show at the airport down in

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,909
my it's not really clear and it took

00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,420
about an hour and a half to decide I was

00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,990
supposed to fly out around four and

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,720
eventually what they did was they

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,630
diverted I think like every JetBlue

00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,280
flight 22 long beach instead which is a

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,590
far superior airport I must say they

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,180
have the cutest control tower of any

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,350
Airport I think in the world don't you

00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,970
ever feel in there but like do yourself

00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:12,760
a favor sometime it's it's adorable it

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:17,769
looks like like a brio toy bike anyway

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,239
um so it turned out to be a much better

00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:21,280
time to flat a little bit later and I've

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,659
never done this but we actually we're

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,290
taking off like right as the Sun was

00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:29,379
setting and so this is an incredible

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,030
time to be flying westward because you

00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:35,230
wind up chasing the sunset as you go

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,549
west and it's incredibly beautiful to be

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,459
up in the air that high and to see it

00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:41,290
and to just have it fade out so slowly

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,430
like it's not something you're used to

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,459
this once it usually it's gone in a few

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,709
minutes and that's it and I was like wow

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,690
like this hadn't happened I would have

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:53,799
you know would have had this experience

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:56,109
um and I kind of dozed off and woke up

00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:59,980
about the time we were landing a long

00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:04,209
beach and you know we're kind of flying

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:08,379
over I guess what must be Palm Springs

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:10,150
like east of east of LA and I just love

00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,579
the way I love LA I think I'll a is like

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,099
my favorite city after New York New York

00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:18,040
is number one sorry guys but I love LA

00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:19,900
and one of the things I love about is

00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,180
flying into it it just is like it just

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,620
expands forever New York is like it's so

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,970
concentrated in one spot it's like

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,290
Manhattan is like such the obvious

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,579
center of it and like you can see it

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,639
from a long ways off there's 12

00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,569
buildings and it's there and one of my

00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,470
favorite things about New York is the

00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:37,780
skyline and it's so beautiful and just

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,160
energetic it's like just so bright the

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,209
whole thing is lit up and it's just

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,310
glowing very strongly and la isn't like

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,160
that la is like it's definitely got an

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:51,389
electric look to it from the air but

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,329
it's like it twinkles and shines and

00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:57,480
it's long and flat it's almost like a

00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,040
good field of i don't know like

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,720
particles just flowing out into every

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,440
direction I think that's so amazing and

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,639
as we got lower and lower I was trying

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,049
it was like what is causing this

00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,970
twinkling it gets really interesting

00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,609
it's like maybe it's some combination of

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,930
like the heat and haze and the pollution

00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:18,400
and who knows but one thing I noticed

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,780
was is we got closer and closer you can

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,979
start to like make out some of the

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,409
houses and some of the windows and

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,490
things and it realized that like some of

00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:26,150
this twinkling was just from people

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,550
turning their lights off and on

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,000
and when you're up in the air you know

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:34,250
like you can see a lot of people at once

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,630
doing something totally mundane which is

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,979
clicking their lights off and I was

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,979
thinking on that so weird like a kid

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,120
nobody down there is like flicking on

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,840
their lights thinking that there's like

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,360
someone a mile up noticing then doing

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:53,990
that but that I was like watching all

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:56,720
the lights go on and on um so I work at

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,430
tumblr on and what I've been thinking

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,280
about in the last six months I when I

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:05,530
was here before I kind of rambled about

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:07,940
music and vision and mortality and

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,440
really like what I've been thinking that

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,620
most about Leigh Leigh's has been vision

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,430
and I think it's also interesting how

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,570
from the air you can't quite you can't

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,590
quite tell with those lights are there's

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,599
no difference between like a street

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,110
light and the light from a house and a

00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:27,380
life from whatever and it could be fire

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:30,139
light for all you know and I think that

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,550
um there's something really interesting

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:35,330
there what I'm doing for tumblr right

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,340
now is thinking about gifs animated gifs

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:41,720
specifically I don't if you know this

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:44,360
tumblr is like a very jiff oriented

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,400
community of people both is like just a

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,860
place to find and consume just but also

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,729
like as an art I think it's being

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,349
advanced and told run a really

00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:57,139
interesting way so I've just been

00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:58,490
thinking lately about you know what are

00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,720
the roots of Jeff why why do we like

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,610
animated gifs so much why are they so

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,560
popular now like what is what is it

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:11,630
tapping into in our minds that that is

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:14,870
makes them so popular and I found out

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,070
that the history of animation and it's

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,729
tied up really tightly with like the

00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:22,070
history of cinema but it's really

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,690
interesting it's like I think that you

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,449
can make a strong point or a strong case

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,659
for the fact that people have been

00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:31,820
thinking about like how vision works and

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:34,909
about how animation specifically might

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,639
work since there has been art I don't

00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:39,240
know how many of you have seen a cave of

00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,680
forgotten dreams it's a

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,699
Werner talking to me about the the cave

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,199
art it's wonderful if you haven't seen

00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:47,639
it go see it see in 3d it's really cool

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,960
but one of the most like startling

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,050
things about it floored me when I first

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,340
thought was he makes a case for some of

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,250
these paintings being some of the first

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,690
animation ever and it's also just some

00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,750
of the first art ever its cave paintings

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,729
that are 35,000 years old there are much

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,849
older than Allah scope a cave paintings

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:08,490
which was proud of the most famous and

00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:13,639
what he notices is there are cave

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,639
paintings that have kind of like varied

00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:18,509
very drawings like over like most like

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:21,030
an onion skin you know like an animation

00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:22,590
like where you have an animator who

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,699
draws the one frame and has like a sheet

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,080
and goes back and forth and kind of

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,759
draws the next thing like slightly off

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,780
and then like this war and move that's

00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,770
like slightly more as you go through the

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:35,729
frames and his theory and I love this is

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:38,340
that whoever painted this intended for

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:41,159
the viewer to be in this cave lit by

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,460
firelight behind them and the effect

00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:45,990
with the fire light flickering on to

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,830
these slightly different shades of black

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:52,050
basically on the wall make the different

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,759
frames visible like depending on how the

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:58,050
lights hitting it and the effect is like

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,580
a very kind of crude animation and this

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,550
is incredible to me this is like it's

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,960
amazing that even as early as cave

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,530
painting it's like immediately people

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:10,469
were already trying to like take it

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:14,490
another step further so I guess um we

00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:18,060
got a minute but like a fast forward

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,710
through time I think it's really

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,009
interesting to see how we've kind of

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,500
gone from like cave paintings I guess

00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,880
basically through to like the zoetrope

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,479
there's like one of the very first

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:34,020
examples of uh I guess modern animation

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,909
technology and I think you can make a

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,550
strong case that the end of that thread

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:42,060
at least so far is animated gifs it's

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:44,399
like there's not much different between

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,540
those cake paintings and gifs and it's

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,820
funny like even researching this on the

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,160
internet like somebody had made you know

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,570
these little short animations into gifs

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,110
that's how that I was experiencing them

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,670
online it's

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,070
incredible how easily they translate

00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:03,360
from literally a medium as ancient as a

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:06,950
cave wall to a tumblr so I'll wrap it up

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,060
but um think a lot about vision I think

00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,339
the future vision is really interesting

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,440
especially now Google glass i think is

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:18,420
about to start marketing to us via barge

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,329
google glass there's a lot of

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,470
interesting things a virtual reality

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,940
starting to come back is the things the

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,399
thing called oculus rift I don't know if

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,250
you're familiar with that it's very cool

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:34,079
it's like a very low cost VR goggles

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:35,070
that are like very good so the future is

00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:38,550
interesting it's like I don't think

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,050
animated gif is the end but we are

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,720
giving more and more control of our

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,600
vision over to devices and things

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,279
without totally understanding how it

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,079
works we don't totally know how it works

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:56,180
there's lots of theories but it's an

00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,180
interesting unknown anyway thank you

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,920
