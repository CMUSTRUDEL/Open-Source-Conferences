hi I'm Kate darling I'm an intellectual

00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:17,080
property researcher at MIT and a fellow

00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:19,960
at Harvard's Berkman Center and last

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,930
year at farmhouse I spoke about a

00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,730
project that i did on how the adult

00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,560
entertainment industry's been dealing

00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,810
with online piracy and copyright

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,910
infringement as you know one of the

00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,910
struggling content industries in the

00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,710
digital age so the study is going to be

00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,350
published in the spring there's a draft

00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,410
online I don't really have much in terms

00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,120
of an update to that project but I

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,520
thought i would tell you a little bit

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,670
about something that people often ask me

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,630
about which is you know what it's like

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:58,630
to be an academic who's associated with

00:00:52,630 --> 00:01:00,640
well porn and in a way I guess this is

00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,329
the story about collapse because it's

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,979
about the collapse of my belief that

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,620
smart people need more reason to dislike

00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:11,860
you than the simple fact that your paper

00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,770
title has adult entertainment in now to

00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,170
be absolutely clear my study had nothing

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,210
whatsoever to do with the content I was

00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,250
purely about economics and shifts and

00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,159
markets brought about by technological

00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,990
disruption and I really think that this

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,170
is an immensely fascinating industry to

00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,049
study from an economics perspective and

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,330
yet very few people do study it for

00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:37,930
reasons that I had anticipated but also

00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,670
a few reasons I hadn't now what I had

00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,330
anticipated and thought long and hard

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,909
about was you know first of all that I

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,729
would forever be associated with the

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:51,070
subject matter but more importantly I

00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:53,080
was worried that people wouldn't take

00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,180
the study seriously from an intellectual

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,840
perspective they would view it as some

00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,720
sort of sexy selling topic so i tried to

00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,610
counter some of this by working very

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,400
hard on the study and on its merits and

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:09,369
trying to be very professional about it

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,500
so I had icy stares ready for every

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,970
student who thought he was the first

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,069
witty person to point out that there

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,020
were no pictures in the paper or for

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,580
every professor who joked that

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:23,320
probably watch a lot of porn I actually

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,750
for a long time did not use the p-word

00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,870
at all I used adult entertainment

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:32,050
despite the syllables that actually

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:34,810
helped with email spam filters too but

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,480
anyway what I wasn't prepared for uh on

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:41,250
the other hand was something else in

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,830
people's reactions namely for example

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,020
there's a tenured professor that I was

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,790
who I was very interested in talking to

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,560
you about the project because she'd done

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:56,950
some tan gentle work and so here I am

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,440
the PhD student looking up to the senior

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:02,020
in my field for guidance and advice and

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:09,010
the first sentence that I get from her

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:14,140
is I am not kidding and it did not get

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:17,520
better like wow that's classy I want to

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,890
be just like you and I grew up anyway um

00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,140
some people reacted viscerally to the

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,170
subject matter despite the fact that my

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,470
study was not about the content and they

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:32,890
reacted so viscerally that it didn't

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,230
seem to matter that I wasn't really

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,060
threatening to their interests um and

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,250
then when I started getting a little bit

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,650
of press for the project I got some

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:45,370
great feedback but Isis also started

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:47,080
getting really hateful mail and I'm for

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,450
instance last year someone boycotted

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,430
farmhouse on the conference because of

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,550
me calling me a porn longer and a

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,100
disgrace to all women and I just had so

00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,670
much trouble wrapping my mind around

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,709
this reaction because I didn't feel like

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,080
I was endorsing anything that they were

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,090
opposing and I figured that once I

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:11,070
explained that I was just interested in

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:16,630
the economics they would understand but

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:18,820
they didn't care um and after a while of

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,549
being very confused about this I

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,970
realized that actually this was a life

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:27,460
lesson for me of sorts for me the

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,010
princess he would always liked everyone

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,790
and been liked back and that was really

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,520
important to

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,130
and had I known that people would

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,150
disapprove of me no matter what in this

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:43,030
instance I probably might not have done

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,710
this study at all um and I'm so glad

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,950
that I did because it's a really good

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,140
study no you know my case is very

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,900
trivial obviously but there are a lot of

00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,150
amazing people out there who deal with

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,760
haters every day for the work that

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,170
they're doing and it's just laid seems

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,580
to be a rule of thumb right if you're

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,160
doing something worth doing you're going

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,050
to make a few enemies and a friend of

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,960
mine was in a similar situation recently

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,570
I'm losing sleep over it and so I just

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,730
want to say to him and to everyone out

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,200
there it gets bogged down and worried

00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:19,330
about people not liking what they're

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:22,630
doing you know be a good person be kind

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:26,050
and be nice and be respectful and be

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:29,200
open but when people don't return those

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,060
sentiments every second spent worrying

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,880
about that or feeling bad about that is

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,140
the second wasted that you could be

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,570
using to continue doing something

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,760
awesome because if you try to please

00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,490
everyone around you you'll never do

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,870
anything meaningful and sometimes haters

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,290
actually mean you're on the right track

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,710
so that's my message to farmhouse go

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,710
make some enemies

00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,980
