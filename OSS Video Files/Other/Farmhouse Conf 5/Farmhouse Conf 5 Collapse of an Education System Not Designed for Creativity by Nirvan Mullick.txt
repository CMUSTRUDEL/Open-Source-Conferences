Playlist: Farmhouse Conf 5
Description: 
	Nirvan discovered a 9 year old kid named Caine who had made an arcade out of cardboard at an auto parts store. Nirvan bought a fun pass and his life was changed. He organized a flash mob to visit Caine's Arcade on one day and changed Caine's life. Nirvan made a short film about the whole experience. And then both of their lives changed. They went from arcade to movie to global movement of kids making amazing things out of cardboard. From there, The Imagination Foundation launched, bringing creativity to classrooms and communities by unplugging for a day to play.
