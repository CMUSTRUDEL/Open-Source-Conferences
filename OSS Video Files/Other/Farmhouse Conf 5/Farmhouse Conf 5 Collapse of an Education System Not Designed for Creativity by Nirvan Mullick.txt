Title: Farmhouse Conf 5 Collapse of an Education System Not Designed for Creativity by Nirvan Mullick
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Farmhouse Conf 5
Description: 
	Nirvan discovered a 9 year old kid named Caine who had made an arcade out of cardboard at an auto parts store. Nirvan bought a fun pass and his life was changed. He organized a flash mob to visit Caine's Arcade on one day and changed Caine's life. Nirvan made a short film about the whole experience. And then both of their lives changed. They went from arcade to movie to global movement of kids making amazing things out of cardboard. From there, The Imagination Foundation launched, bringing creativity to classrooms and communities by unplugging for a day to play.

how many of you know the story of

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,930
Caine's Arcade okay so nirvan mullick is

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,310
the guy who made that film that you

00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:20,070
watched about it he's an LA resident as

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,960
well an Angeleno I don't think I fully

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,710
like lived here enough to feel like I

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,990
could call myself an Angeleno yet and

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,340
he's going to tell us about that little

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:38,940
story and where we go from there right

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:41,219
all right there Vaughn thanks so she

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,370
asked me to share the story Caine's

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,659
Arcade is a 11 minute documentary that I

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,679
posted online about a year and a half

00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:51,389
ago and since then it has grown from a

00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,809
movie into this movement to foster

00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:56,609
creativity and kids around the world all

00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:58,460
unintentionally and Shane asked me to

00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:02,069
kind of share how that fits into

00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,760
collapse of an education system that's

00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:07,350
not fostering creativity and kids so my

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,539
background is in filmmaking experimental

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,030
animation I want to share a little bit

00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:15,180
of my own story kind of context in which

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,070
the film I made found itself and then

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,859
how that thumb came to be and what's

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,890
happened since then so in terms of

00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,560
context there's the sense that there's a

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,600
creativity crisis in schools Sir Ken

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,359
Robinson stead pockets most popular talk

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,890
on TED talks about how schools are

00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,040
killing creativity they were sort of

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:40,060
setup and an industrial society to

00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,210
that make kids uniform and IBM did a

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,320
study you know 1,500 executives and the

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,390
thing that they want the most is

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,090
creativity but it's not really being

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,870
fostered in kids some kids are getting

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,400
crew but a lot of them are being missed

00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,960
there's a site psychologist named

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,370
Torrance just started studying

00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,780
creativity back in the 50s and doing a

00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,180
creativity test finding it you can

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,220
actually measure creativity he would do

00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,510
things that would measure divergent and

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,280
convergent thinking divergent thinking

00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,800
coming up with lots of ideas and then

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,330
convergent thinking focusing those ideas

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,270
to create something of value which is

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,480
what creativity is and he gave this test

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,670
of millions of kids they give a kid like

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,040
a fire truck and say like a toy fire

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,840
truck and say come up with ideas on how

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,420
to make this truck better and then

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,670
measure how many unique cool ideas these

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,140
kids with cloth with and this was done

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,570
in the 50s they've been tracking those

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,660
kids since then over time and they found

00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:41,140
the kids who did perform well on this

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:45,010
are three times more likely to succeed

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:48,850
more patents more inventions more

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:51,160
success more even happiness and they

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,769
took a new look at this study recently

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,100
and found that so there's something CQ

00:02:53,769 --> 00:03:00,459
creativity quotient and IQ you know and

00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,380
IQ and seek you were both going up over

00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,390
time and then in the 90s something

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,690
happened where CQ has been going down

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,209
and nobody's quite sure why just yet

00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,950
whether it's increase in video games

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,950
some people believe some people disagree

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:17,170
strongly whether it's No Child Left

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,760
Behind and this reliance on standardized

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,160
testing where teachers really aren't

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,760
given chance to teach the kids passions

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,160
and have to teach this test and so

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,950
there's a lot of debate still out but

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:33,430
there is this sense that the CQ has been

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,760
the client so this is the context in

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:39,790
which I found myself I I went to public

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,799
school in Florida and I was I consider

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,540
myself a lucky kid I was bored out of my

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,519
mind in grade school I was actually

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,430
paddled and spanked for playing with my

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,600
food and taking flip books and animation

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,240
in my books

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,130
and then in third grade I got pulled out

00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,650
of class and given this weird creativity

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,180
test I didn't know what it was at the

00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,470
time but I thought it was a lot better

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,800
than the other test I was being given

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,440
and I did well enough and then I got

00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,700
labeled as this gifted child and one day

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,760
a week i would get pulled out of my

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,920
boring as hell class and put into this

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,500
really fun class where we were taught

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,390
bringing riddles and did fun stuff and

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,459
has actually introduced something called

00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,110
future problem-solving which is a

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,960
program that was actually invented by

00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,460
torrance weird connection and through

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,380
that I learned a lot about creative

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,810
problem-solving creative thinking and a

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,660
lot of the tools I use today as a

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,860
filmmaker and a consultant I traced back

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:38,260
to that and I think that really saved me

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,240
so I became a filmmaker I came out here

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,790
I went to calarts study experimental

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,130
animation did some obscure film started

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,870
some obscure nonprofits if any way here

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:51,270
has heard of the one second film project

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:55,240
this is a film I started 15 years ago

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,620
anyway so I my story with Cain and

00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,050
Caine's Arcade begins about two years

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,700
ago when i went to buy a door handle for

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:05,140
my car I had a 96 corolla a legacy of

00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,540
being an independent filmmaker trying to

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,750
make non-profit films and you have this

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,670
broken door handle and I live downtown

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,280
and there's this industrial part of

00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:18,220
downtown just over the LA River in East

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,290
LA Boyle Heights and you can get used

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,060
glass used auto parts and i pulled into

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:26,380
this random auto parts store called

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,150
smart parts aftermarket and when i

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,280
pulled in I met this nine-year-old boy

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,050
named Kane who takin over this was his

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,550
dad's auto parts store and he had taken

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,070
over the whole front of the store with

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,900
this really elaborate arcade that he'd

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,640
made entirely out of cardboard in his

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,300
imagination he'd spent all summer

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,280
building it and I was instantly curious

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,040
asked him how it worked and he told me I

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,930
mean this so it's an auto parts store

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,090
but then there's this whole front part

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,710
of this store that's been taken over by

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,880
these cardboard games and he had like

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,290
three or four games there was a

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,030
cardboard basketball game with this

00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,550
little basketball hoop there's a little

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,500
soccer game with army goalies and you

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,520
could flick a paper ball a little ski

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,530
ball game that you may

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,840
he had a whole wall of prizes and

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,120
displays that he'd made with toy cars

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,069
his own personal objects so I asked him

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,050
out work he said for one dollar you get

00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:16,870
four turns or for two dollars you could

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:20,530
get a fun pass and get 500 turns for

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:25,060
circular so i bought the fun pass

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:26,979
obviously and i ended up playing his

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,919
games and they were really fun like

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:31,990
there were really simple materials after

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,879
i bought the fun past he had ipod

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,789
headphones those white ones he'd made a

00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,259
little office so he stamped my hand with

00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:40,270
a little stamp and then he leans into

00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:42,669
these headphones that are plugged into a

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,490
cardboard box he said fun past two

00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:46,750
dollars and that's when I was like

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:51,310
looking around like wondering what

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:53,680
what's going on and then he said wait a

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,240
second year you know this is mike my

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,729
grand opening he ran around back and he

00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,650
comes back to this paper paper crushed

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:02,080
up paper ball which was the soccer ball

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,340
in the basketball hoop and when I'd

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,770
score a point like I'd be playing

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,509
basketball and and when I score a point

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,370
he would crawl into the box and push out

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:12,190
price tickets from inside the box I

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:17,050
would come out and that that was this

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:19,840
moment in my life where like that movie

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,060
ratatouille were the there's a chef and

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,560
and a few critic and he eats the bite of

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,020
the soup and he get sucked back to his

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,729
childhood and he has this memory and

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,050
kind of steer in his eye that was me in

00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:31,779
the middle of its auto parts store on

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,130
his random Sunday afternoon I was a kid

00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,810
again I was reminded of my own

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,779
creativity my own imagination why I

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,120
started making films and it's rare that

00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:41,860
you feel that feeling of inspiration and

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,520
I said I want to make a film about this

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:48,039
and and so I went back was telling all

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,569
my friends about Caine's Arcade and I

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:53,800
went back they still had some terms of

00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:55,719
my son path to try to play and Kane

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,240
wasn't there I met him on the last day

00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:00,699
of summer so he actually was going back

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,500
to school I met his dad and his dad

00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,210
recognized me from the security camera

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,389
footage because they had he been in the

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,039
back and he saw me and I told my want to

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,569
make a short film about his son's arcade

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,889
and after that would be cool he said

00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:13,419
that you know Cain would love that but

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:14,740
you should know it's kind of a little

00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:17,450
joke around here because you've been

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,100
Kane's first and only customer

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:23,220
yeah I had that same feeling I was like

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,770
my heart was broken he told me that Cain

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,870
had been there all summer working on

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:30,600
this arcade building it perfecting it

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,310
and he would be asking all his dad's

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,260
customers to play and everybody just

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:38,580
walked by and got their auto part and

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:41,130
left and Cain never gave up so Cain was

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,510
super ready for customers right like not

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,600
only did he have this elaborate arcade

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,820
and prizes and his own toys he had his

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,350
own t-shirt it said Caine's Arcade on

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,210
the back and on the front it said staff

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:57,080
I mean this is a lemonade stand gone to

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,190
the extreme and as dad told me that cane

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,839
wouldn't wear his shirt to school like

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,820
he only wore it on the weekends when he

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,560
came to work because he told his friends

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,640
at school that he had his own arcade and

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,390
his friends didn't believe him and they

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,580
would tease him about it so I decided as

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,320
part of the film oh he also had the

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,690
security system right so on the back of

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,180
the fun pass on all of his games he had

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,410
taped a calculator to all the games and

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,480
I asked him what did the cop caters for

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,700
he said it's for security and on the

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,810
back of the fun pass he had written two

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:30,660
numbers actually have my fun past year

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,339
so he'd written two numbers a big number

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,339
and a small number and he said what you

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,510
do is you turned the calculators on and

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,770
you put the big number in and then you

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,200
push the checkmark button and then the

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:44,910
small number comes out and I was like a

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:47,400
check mark but he had created his own

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,470
childhood encryption just playing around

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:54,900
with a calculator I was like this kid is

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:58,040
a genius so as part of the short film I

00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,830
decided to organize a flash mob of

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,110
surprise customers to make Kane's day I

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,700
posted this event on Facebook just

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,200
describing what I loved about his arcade

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,360
and inviting people to come out and play

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,520
and it got shared around it got passed

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,150
to this facebook site called hidden LA

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,580
which had about 230,000 fans and an hour

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,790
later an NBC News truck was at Caine's

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,560
Arcade and his dad called me Akane sad

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,050
cause he's like NBC News is there I'm

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,530
like taking Kane down to the arcade and

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,180
I was like no no don't go you think why

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,180

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,480
about the news and his dad made up this

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,570
story about people were stealing cars

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,700
down there the news was covering it and

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:52,649
kind of covered it up and Kane's like oh

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,390

00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,760
hit the front page of reddit right the

00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:00,089
this facebook event and all of a sudden

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,770
it was going viral there were tens of

00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,510
thousands of people rooting for Kane and

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,480
hundreds of people were going to come

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,060
out the next day to play his games so I

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,620
started making this film on Kane

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:13,200
accorded his everyday normal day life

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,790
and he was getting used to a camera

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,370
around and then the next day his dad

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,899
took him to shakeys pizza which is where

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,220
he'd always go and play the arcade games

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,020
there and that's where he won that first

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,880
basketball hoop that he started building

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,680
his whole arcade with and while he was

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,440
at Shakey's Pizza hundreds of people

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,300
came and met up at Caine's Arcade we

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,339
made signs that said Caine's Arcade and

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,110
posters and when his dad brought him

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,209
back there were hundreds of people

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,100
chanting he came to play you know

00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:40,770
holding up these signs for Cain and and

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,540
we just filmed his smile and if you

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,750
haven't seen it you can watch the film

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,640
but it's this really magical smile and

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,410
the film was all about just making this

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,880
kid's day and how this internet came

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,880
together and a group of strangers came

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,930
together to make this kid's day and kind

00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,370
of thought that would be the end of it I

00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,470
told his dad that I wanted to try to

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,060
raise a scholarship fund for Cain and so

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,730
at the end of the film I made this

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,080
little website Caine's Arcade calm and

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,180
invited people to chip into a

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,230
scholarship fund and I told his dad I

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,000
was going to try to raise twenty five

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,060
thousand dollars for his son and his dad

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,980
was like yeah right you know good luck I

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,950
said well if we fall short we fall short

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,279
but maybe in a year or so will will

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:22,950
raise a couple grand and I'll help out I

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,000
posted to someone april nine 2012 about

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,770
a year and a half ago is the day after

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,720
my birthday it's not my birthday editing

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,270
the film i was like i need to finish

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,640
this before Cain doesn't care about his

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:36,700
arcade anymore so that was my deadline

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,020
I I posted the film and the first day

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,910
the film was posted it got over a

00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,220
million views it just went completely

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,990
bananas and we raised over sixty

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:53,560
thousand dollars for a scholarship fund

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:56,200
on day one so we raised the goal to a

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,490
hundred thousand dollars and thinking

00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,490
you know by the time Kane's ready for a

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,260
college that might cover semester and

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:04,630
the next day was 110 thousand dollars

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,710
and people just kept donating and then

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,090
we were like well do we raise the goal

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:12,940
again and his dad's like yes please

00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:14,320
about a million dollars but we didn't

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,120
want to keep raising this goal without

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,220
having a plan things are happening so

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,250
fast and people were investing in us

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,390
reaching this goal and without a plan we

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,520
didn't want to take advantage of that

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,740
kind of online trust right now people

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,420
are coming together online to make not

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,960

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,850
really awesome thing and this film like

00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,530
this was my first time really going

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:39,010
through this viral phenomenal experience

00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:41,080

I take advantage of I didn't sleep the

00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:23,620
first two days and it wasn't just the

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,180
money we're raising for Cain but you

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,240
know hit our Facebook page went up to

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,770
130 thousand fans overnight and parents

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,230
were posting these pictures of their

00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,240
kids who'd seen the film and then went

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,740
to the trash took out some cardboard and

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,600
started making their own arcades and

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,220
setting them up in their kitchen you

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,840
know and making their own shirts and

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,660
they were like how are we gonna get

00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,160
customers into our kitchen you know and

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,080
there this was all over the world and

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,090
kids were making these arcades in there

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,860
Raja's and their schools they were using

00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:53,110
them to raise money for children cancer

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,300
research for their school art program

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,620
all these beautiful stories were coming

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,630
in and I was just trying to read the

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,710
internet for this first two days Yahoo

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,700
put the video on their homepage and they

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,860
contacted us and said this was the most

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,780
positively received story we've ever had

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,400
in our home page of all time we actually

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,110
put it back on their homepage a few days

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,650
later so this really phenomenal

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,990
phenomenal response grown men were

00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,150
posting these response videos of the

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,800
film and it was just them crying it was

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:26,410
like the opposite of two girls one cup

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:28,420
like it was much more uplifting and I

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,920
was just stoked that this was all

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,280
happening and after two days of not

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,950
sleeping I had you know I was kind of

00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,600
just this blind goal at the time to try

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,000
to start this nonprofit that could take

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,080
this viral moment and turn it into more

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,790
of a movement that could foster

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,220
creativity of other kids like Cain

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:48,070
because while kaine story and how thus

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,240
internet came together was unique you

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,090
know the fact that there was this

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,600
creative kid like Cain there's kids like

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:57,730
him in auto part stores and everybody

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,680
had it knows a kid like pain in their

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:02,410
community so how can we foster their

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,870
creativity and I i wrote a mission on a

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,400
napkin or in the mission was to find

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,870
foster and fun creativity and

00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,690
entrepreneurship and more kids like Cain

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,580
and then I tried to leverage all the

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:15,910
media attention to try to raise money

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:18,430
for this nonprofit so five days after

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,200
the film came out I reached out to the

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,270
goldhirsch foundation I've been

00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,680
goldhirsch I've known it for 12 years he

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,090
was on the board of another nonprofit I

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,450
started there's a lot of trust there he

00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:30,970
started good magazine and he said you

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,610
are starting at the destination there

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,720
are so many organizations spending tens

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,250
and hundreds of millions of dollars

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,650
trying to get this kind of engagement

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,680
and encourage project-based learning and

00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:43,360
kids and you guys have stumbled on it

00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,830
how can I help I said well we need some

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,500
resources you said let me know what you

00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,270
need and the answer is yes five days

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,540
after the film was posted the golders

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:55,360
Foundation gave us a $250,000 challenge

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,070
grant that started matching donations to

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,260
Kane scholarship fund so for every

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,670
dollar given by the public to Kane

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,350
scholarship the goal

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,569
First Foundation started giving up the

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,880
dollar to start this nonprofit and

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:08,860
that's what became something we now call

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,209
the imagination foundation it didn't

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,429
have a name it didn't have any programs

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,679
at the beginning it just had this viral

00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,419
video and this authentic response from

00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,650
kids and parents and educators around

00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:22,870
the world so I was able to have people

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,790
help me answer emails and coordinate

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,140
this response from educators all over

00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,809
and within the first two months we

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,640
started a school pilot program and over

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:32,740
200 schools in nine countries started

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,630
building cardboard arcades and using the

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,280
film to teach kids math science

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,400
engineering a lot of project-based

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,590
learning core values and that went

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,640
really well and then we decided to

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:47,350
develop that even further now October

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,770
second was when we did the first flash

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,179
mob for Cain so the film was posted in

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,710
april six months later was the

00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:56,410
anniversary and we decided to try to

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,690
mark the day of play that we had for

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,000
cain with something we called the global

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,500
cardboard challenge so we issued this

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,929
global cardboard challenge I made a

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,049
follow up video called Caine's Arcade to

00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,640
which was posted three weeks before the

00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:11,919
anniversary of this day and we just

00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,940
challenged people around the world kids

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,280
around the world to build something

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,500
awesome using cardboard recycled

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,750
materials and their imagination and then

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,970
on the anniversary the flash mob we did

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,440
for Kane we said we're going to have a

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,780
global day of play where we have a flash

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,520
mob for kids all around the world go out

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,100
and celebrate the creativity of kids in

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,669
your community so within the three weeks

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:37,150
of posting that second video we had over

00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:39,340
270 events in 40 countries organized

00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:43,090
over 11,000 kids took part the first

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,410
year it was really really awesome and so

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,570
we decided to do it again we just had

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,919
our second global cardboard challenge

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,770
and day of play and this year we had

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,290
over 80,000 kids take part and 44

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,390
countries around the world so it grew

00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:57,280
seven hundred percent it's something

00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,770
about the story that sparks the

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,900
imagination of kids combined with

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,669
cardboard this simple material that's

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,950
just inspiring kids to unplug and play

00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:08,049
so it's this really beautiful scalable

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,820
project-based learning model it's

00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:13,179
growing in capacity we had over 40

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,410
libraries take part this year and Canaan

00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:16,450
I've gotten to go around the world

00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,820
travel and share the story so the impact

the city the Saturday after the video

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,010
was posted this was unannounced you know

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,720
we didn't have a flash mob but over a

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,610
thousand people came out to play camps

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,410
games there was like a fairy tale there

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,150
was a line around the block was like a

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,410
four or five-hour line that people were

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,170
waiting to play these cardboard games

00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:37,120
people traveled all around the world

00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,410
Jack Black has come with his kids to

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,720
play and actually they sent us this home

00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,310
video of his kids at home making

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,120
cardboard games after they've been and

00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:48,100
visited so it was trending worldwide if

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,870
Justin Timberlake was tweeting it out it

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:55,270
was it just got all this press and media

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:56,860
around the world and Kane Kane has

00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,930
recently retired he ran his arcade for

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,430
about two years and then he got tired of

00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,800
pushing the tickets out from inside the

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:08,650
box and his new dreams to start up a

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:11,860
bike shop but the the bottom line is

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,420
this is changed Kane's life I mean we've

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,330
not only through the scholarships fun

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,470
but just when I met him I asked what he

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,870
wanted to be and he said he wanted to

00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,040
join the SWAT team you know now when

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,010
people ask him what he wants to be he's

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,210
like a game designer an engineer or the

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,250
SWAT team but is

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:34,200
horizons have broadened and his dad told

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:37,620
me that when I first met Cain his he was

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,299
behind in reading and his teachers and

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,700
school actually considered him slow and

00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,799
I want to hold him back a year and since

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,080
this whole experience not only has his

00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,840
grades improved he stopped stuttering

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,940
he's a shy kid you know it took him a

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,890
while to open up even on camera I was a

00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,850
public speaker he gets paid to travel

00:21:52,890 --> 00:22:00,120
he's got an agent at WME and his school

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:02,610
considers him gifted he's the gifted kid

00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,360
that he always was but it's changed his

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:08,130
approach and his own self-confidence and

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,870
so for me there's like three big lessons

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,690
the first is that every child is gifted

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,160
and we need to foster the creativity of

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,570
every child giving them not only the

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,250
skills to build the world's they

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,230
imagined but to also imagine the world

00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,110
that they can build these are the people

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,549
who are going to be solving tomorrow's

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:26,370
problems to these problems that we don't

00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:27,990
have the solutions for yet the next big

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,270
lesson for me was at any moment can be a

00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,490
movement because I went to buy a door

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:35,580
handle for my cars where this started

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,140
for me and and just the the fact that

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,090
the smallest moments can often have the

00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,190
biggest impact and it doesn't take much

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,320
to change the life of a child and then

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,510
the third lesson and with what I would

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,360
encourage all of you to always do is to

00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:51,590
always buy the fun pass is an awesome

00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,590
deal thanks

00:22:54,359 --> 00:23:07,419
lavery so that talk was actually a while

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:10,539
in the making the I definitely tried to

00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:13,989
get them last time at cuff for future

00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:17,889
that sort of fit Hugh maniacally and

00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:20,190
also at UM remember the dates right at

00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:22,330
disruption but just like they were

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,340
totally blowing up and all over the

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,450
world nirvan are you still in earshot

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:31,029

00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:36,729

exploratorium kit got run of the

00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:44,879
exploratorium that's pretty awesome

00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:15,409

awesome but what I was going to share is

00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:30,230
this story from robert manning who is

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,299
the lead engineer of NASA and JPL who

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,909
saw the story and pulled us aside and

00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:37,100
said you know when I was a kid I used to

00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:39,740
make cardboard rockets one in my

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,240
backyard and now I just went like built

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,039
one that landed on Mars because he was

00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,770
the lead engineer on the Mars rover

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,559
project so he took Kane and I to JPL and

00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:50,000
we got this special little tour I

00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:52,490
included that story in the follow-up

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,890
film Caine's Arcade part two and then

00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:57,529
about a month ago we were in Colorado

00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:01,100

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:21,110
that startup business whatever you want

00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,149
to do with it he's like oh ok ok his

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,549
kids a hustler exactly it's a

00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:27,740
scholarship to the school of life yeah I

00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:29,600
mean Kane is such an entrepreneur when

00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,610
we when when he had these thousands of

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,289
people come for his arcade and people

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,360
came every weekend every time it was

00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:39,799
open but there was literally a four-hour

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:42,550
line so he made a fast fun pass for $25

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,860
you could skip the line

00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,240
and parents were so stoked because I

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,740
mean they had kids that wanted to skip

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,360
this new land to come to play Caine's

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,490
Arcade so they're like a two-dollar fun

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,750
pass is such a savings for us so they

00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:57,280
were stoked and then Kane also started a

00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,710
family fun path where you get six fun

00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,210
passes for 1199 so it was like a grand

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:03,210
savings of a penny if you bought in bulk

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,570
