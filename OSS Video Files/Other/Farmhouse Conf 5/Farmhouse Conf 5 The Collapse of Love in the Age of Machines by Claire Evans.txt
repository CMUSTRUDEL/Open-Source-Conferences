Title: Farmhouse Conf 5 The Collapse of Love in the Age of Machines by Claire Evans
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Farmhouse Conf 5
Description: 
	When it comes to love, we might all be Luddites. Wouldn't we smash the machine that told us precisely where and when our former paramours found someone new? Unfortunately, the global index that contains every gossamer byte of the love letters we're always unwittingly writing as we make contact across the web is quite unsmashable. We are at a fundamental cultural tipping point in how we deal with love, courtship and inevitably, heartbreak. Is this the collapse of love as we know it? How do we renegotiate intimacy in the Internet age?

hi everyone thanks so much for paying

00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:10,379
attention for a little while this is a

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,629
talk that I've given a couple times

00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:15,869
before about love and the internet and

00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:20,690
how relationships are sort of collapsing

00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:23,880
under of tautological met a nightmare so

00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,700
in 1984 the year that I was born William

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,410
Gibson termed Cyprus cyberspace coined

00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,810
the word cyberspace and defined it as a

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,759
consensual hallucination experienced

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,219
daily by billions of legitimate

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,140
operators and although that novel

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,609
predated the universal adoption of the

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,609
world wide web as a communication

00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:43,789
technology and his internet as you

00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,780
defined it as a sort of virtual reality

00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:48,659
semantic space where you can navigate

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,409
information via distances and structures

00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:54,539
that's not at least not yet our web he

00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:58,170
was right I think in calling the network

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,210
a hallucination we all know on some

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,429
foggy level that the internet is made up

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,830
of tactile things that it's a real

00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,930
object in the world a grandly diffused

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,090
object but an object nonetheless that's

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,189
composed of routers and computers and

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,200
vast fiber optic backbone underneath the

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,479
ocean but the consensual hallucination

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,549
of our time is that we imagine it as

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,200
something that's ineffable in fact the

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,000
trend of the moment now is to think

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,369
about the Internet as a cloud which for

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,789
most people conjures up this idea of

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,890
information floating in tangibly in the

00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:31,049
firmament and although we can't see it

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,369
there we sort of plays it up there with

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,960
language and with collective belief this

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,549
movement towards thinking about the

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,740
Internet as something abstract shows

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,030
absolutely no terms of slowing if you

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,759
think about another one of our science

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,350
fiction prophets arthur c clarke he said

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,460
that any sufficiently advanced

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,939
technology is indistinguishable from

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,350
magic and we are reaching that point of

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,310
course we've always been this way I mean

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,310
most of us don't know how our

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,780
wristwatches or cars work we interface

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,700
with our technology the parts of our

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,819
technology that cater to our monkey

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,469
hands like slots and buttons and and for

00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,270
the rest for most of us at least you

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,759
know all these plastic and metal boxes

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,640
that dot our world are largely beyond us

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,440
in terms of their workings and those who

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,310
do know how these systems work which I

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,080
imagine is a lot of people here actually

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,459
comprise such a small segment of the

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,770
population that they kind of wheeled

00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,870
disproportionate power we call them

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,040
programmers or hackers and most people

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,540
take for granted that that knowledge

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,819
that they have is somehow inaccessible

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,380
or arcane while simultaneously growing

00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:32,080
themselves unthinkingly into the

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,670
Technium 12 hours a day this is

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,420
particularly true i think for younger

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,440
generations I'm 28 oh that's so I can

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,510
remember a time before the Internet

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,950
really dominated my relationships in my

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,989
personal life but a lot of one younger

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,940
friends can't and sometimes when i'm

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:48,580
perusing the accounts of my followers on

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,549
instagram um i discover all of these

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,870
attention hungry teenagers who quantify

00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:55,360
their popularity and hence to a certain

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,310
level their identity by all of the corn

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,890
of viable matrices of traffic towards

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:04,030
their small corner of the internet by

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,920
follow packs and at replies their

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,330
neediness kind of leaps off the screen

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,340
it's a lot of follow me follow me follow

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,530
me i'll follow you back i always follow

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,260
back which you know if you think about

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,690
it as kind of a closed system because

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,519
you know that is going so the emotional

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,310
quality of that need is really directly

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,280
proportionate to how real the experience

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,930
of the online as for younger people the

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,359
different looking a relationship lived

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,510
in the world and a relationship lived on

00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:33,160
line is sometimes indistinguishable as

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,200
they say on the internet pics or it

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,410
didn't happen which i think is more

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,850
profound than we think it's not just

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,290
teenagers I mean I'm sure all of us in

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,790
the same way I prefer email to the phone

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,880
I've gotten to a point with a bonus of

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,160
horrifying and i also like being able to

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,230
by typing in the name of an individual

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,700
thumb up and draw up all of our

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,500
correspondences from the moment that we

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,810
began corresponding it's this like

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,639
incredibly simultaneous experience of

00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,900
the relationship condensed and presented

00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,930
to you in a way that makes it feel like

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,410
it doesn't have a temporal nature at all

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,690
it's always existing in this one space

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:10,510
you know for any intimacy that's

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:13,209
experienced partially through the medium

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,470
of the web this carnal are chronological

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:16,329
record that completes past and present

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,820
for a lot of intents and purposes kind

00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:21,039
of becomes the relationship we are more

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,810
than the sum of our experiences we've

00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:25,270
become the sum of our recorded

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,580
experiences and as we increasingly live

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,580
our social lives publicly in a medium

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,830
that although

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,099
shifting retains all the traces of our

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,509
noodling the asymptote of the record and

00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:39,050
the relationship reaches a point of

00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:40,729
indistinguishable ax t of course my

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,819
parents generation did this differently

00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:45,650
instead of a completed in box of ones

00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:49,449
and zeros they had a box of love letters

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:52,460
under the bed but the difference is this

00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:54,530
while the box of love letters and my

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,530
email correspondences may serve the same

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,689
purpose if you burn a box of love

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,789
letters or scrapbook of mementos in a

00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:03,889
fit of pique all of a sudden the

00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:05,780
relationship only exists in the minds of

00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:09,169
the people that experienced it it

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,030
becomes subjective foggy and headed

00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,520
inevitably as all memories do towards

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,979
forgetting we don't need proofs to tell

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,379
us that memories are unreliable and you

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,719
don't need me to tell you that people

00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:23,960
especially young people no longer have

00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:27,740
the freedom to forget it's interesting

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,599
to note here as an aside the shifting

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,240
definition of the word memory think

00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:34,729
before computing memory meant something

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,129
singularly unreliable by definition a

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:39,199
memory was a ghost a strange and

00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:41,810
personally location of a completely felt

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,750
experience something subjective and

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,849
fallible now memory is a technical

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,060
specification something that can be

00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:53,419
counted and counted on it's also

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:57,430
monolithic I have memories whatever they

00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:59,900
are but my computer has memory of course

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,839
the moment that we began taking photos

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,759
making films making art or externalizing

00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,520
the human experience through so-called

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,379
mass media we set into motion an

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,650
immeasurably vast prosthetic memory for

00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:15,169
the human race art is a complex memory

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,650
that we collaboratively create and what

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:20,870
we can't live directly or recall we can

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,870
live second hand through art through

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,759
film through data we can lose touch

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,110
between but with a difference between

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,599
our own memories and the memories of

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,520
others we can see things that happened

00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,770
before we were born we can watch ghosts

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,060
talk I think this is another William

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,669
Gibson thing we are building ourselves

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,289
mirrors that remember public mirrors

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:41,590
that wander around and remember what

00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,880
they've seen but

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,290
these definitions of memory are

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,570
approaching one another now because

00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,090
today's memories are distributed across

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:51,940
the network a sufficiently talented

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,460
hacker or web archaeologist or curious

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,410
third party could in reconstituting all

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,930
the little pieces of data left behind

00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,450
could reconstitute a relationship from

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,700
the traces that it's left behind online

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,290
we think that we're clever with our you

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,660
know selective curation of our personal

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,130
information online but every click

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,750
leaves a trace we all know this i mean

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,120
our online shopping records our air

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,490
travel itineraries all the likes and

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,070
tweets and retweets and emails all of

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,690
the articles and books that we read on

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,030
recommendation and in a slightly more

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,200
abstract sense just the ideas that we

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,480
absorb from the people that we love and

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,360
disseminate outwards endlessly to our

00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,450
extended communities in a sense now

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,770
every relationship exists on two levels

00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,600
there's the real you know the moments

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,100
that we spend in close proximity with

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,770
one another than you're a chemical

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,930
effect of proximity and then the digital

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,420
just as physical places now all have a

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,910
second reality of location-based game

00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,070
layers every relationship too has a

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,810
digital component at digital shadow and

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,810
depending on the nature of the people

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,240
involved that shadow can defy real-world

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,150
physics it can loom larger than the

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,100
object which casts it of course this is

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,720
a simplification I mean truth all

00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,790
relationships now contain a sort of

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,310
inextricable mix of digital and real

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:10,240
components combined in the fabric of the

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:13,210
simultaneous now but Anita cases causes

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,920
problems when relationships end in a

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,020
world with a relationship and it's

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,490
record share so much real estate that

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,770
they're often confused for one another

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,470
defining an end to either of them can

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,590
seem impossible we're all familiar with

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,030
this scenario I'm sure you've terminated

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,210
a romantic relationship or friendship

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,800
for whatever reason you've burned the

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,320
box of love letters figuratively or

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,940
otherwise you perhaps you untagged

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,650
yourself from all their photos on

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,570
facebook which is the 21st century

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:44,050
version of cutting your ex-boyfriend

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:47,680
space out of the yearbook you've deleted

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:50,380
our emails but the social web does not

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,110
want you to sever ties with anyone at

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,910
every turn and asks you to reconsider

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,530
the entire economic engine

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,240
ends on the vibrancy and activity of

00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,030
connection because groups of the

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,500
commodity being sold not individual the

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,330
architecture of a social web like a

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,770
Vegas casino will always lead you back

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,290
inside relationships that you want to

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:11,020
leave behind it's increasingly difficult

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,120
to end things we don't experience

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,900
emotional cataclysms anymore we simply

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,030
surgically remove touch ruptures serious

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,740
ruptures are softened by instead of

00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:25,390
cutting someone out of your life you can

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,950
now hide them from your timeline and

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,170
even when a connection is explicitly

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,330
severed via the act of unfriending which

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,210
is despite being the ultimate you know

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:37,900
act of drama is like the poke a

00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,460
completely meaningless Act aspects of

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,790
that person will always fall through the

00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,440
cracks through mutual friends through

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,830
images and through advertisements

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,320
tailored to your extinguished needs the

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:52,330
vast and broadly disseminated collection

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,160
of bits which has served for so long as

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,540
a record of your private and public

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,730
entanglement with somebody else will

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,680
always remain it might not be

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,150
immediately accessible to you but the

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,820
information that you were friends or

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,250
that you were lovers lives on it's there

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,840
somewhere I mean when subpoenaed

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,880
facebook can and will produce an

00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,780
insanely mighty document of every click

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,920
and poke there is a record at the end of

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,190
a bad relationship you would think to

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,660
yourself that it was a waste of time and

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,770
you know having wasted a lot of time or

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,800
energy on something which ultimately

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,900
failed it's part of being human these

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,760
regrets define us we consoled ourselves

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,980
by saying that they make us who we are

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,480
that they brought us to this point they

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,510
prepared us for the following challenges

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,070
and that's true in life boy your failed

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,530
relationships may well have been a waste

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,240
of your time the digital shadows which

00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,160
they cast which make up a significant

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,040
bulk of their existence now those are

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,870
only a waste of your bandwidth and since

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,810
we're speaking of an internetwork really

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,310
it's our bandwidth I should clarify

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,530
there are different kinds of connections

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,660
those connections between people

00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:59,140
expressed in shared moments and feelings

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,230
and touch actions and words and the

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,860
profound communion of shared silence and

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,510
then there's a connections between

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,330
computers which are expressed in terms

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,740
of packets and protocols but all of

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,680
these varieties of connection

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,630
acquire a type of bandwidth and one can

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,370
think of the capacity to put time and

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,410
effort into maintaining a functional

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,540
relationship with another human being as

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:23,380
a kind of emotional or personal

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:25,839
bandwidth love like light passes through

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,830
all of us like information down a fiber

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,000
optic backbone and although each

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,450
individual has their own specific

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,830
capacity for love some people can love

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,050
more than one person at the same time

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:40,390
some people can only love themselves

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,270
some people can only love one person

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,100
their whole lives that emotional

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,260
bandwidth is fluid and subjective

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,470
capable of changing with time as we grow

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,070
wiser or less wise but our digital

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,480
bandwidth is quantifiable and

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,130
unfortunately it's record continues to

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,060
exist even when the actual relationship

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,940
doesn't over usage of emotional

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,200
bandwidth is taxing on the individual

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,060
like a computer network we must be

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,740
properly peered that is to say

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,270
physically and voluntarily

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,220
interconnected to the other party

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,420
allowing the information of the

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,520
relationship to pass through both

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,200
parties equally improving the

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,550
functionality of the traffic of that

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,430
small system in a mutually beneficial

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,800
contract without that vital back and

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:27,459
forth individuals like machines can

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:31,329
overheat and collapse collapse of course

00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:33,520
I made a fit of course as none of us

00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:35,620
operate in a vacuum improperly peered

00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,089
personal system damage not only the

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,089
individual but the entire extended

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,610
network in brief if one person reaches

00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:46,329
the limit of their capacity to love and

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:48,399
fails we all do the free for all of the

00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:51,160
world wide web is nearing its end it's

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,140
not over at its peak we had the freedom

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,270
to make mistakes because we still had

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,390
unlimited data plans and we still had a

00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,589
margin of anonymity but now as our

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,510
internet service providers have become

00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:04,089
the slow throttling of our bandwidth and

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,279
our privacy is increasingly dubious we

00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:07,950
no longer can speed intoxicated down

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,079
what was once so innocently called

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,730
information superhighway we all

00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,070
experience the internet as a means to

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,560
access profound emotional experiences in

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:20,440
the world beyond us what our providers

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,940
will always see it as dollars in bits in

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,690
order to feed this problem I think that

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,030
we must begin

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,410
treat it that way as well because now

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,450
that we face the possibility of reaching

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,550
our cap every relationship is an

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,920
investment every relationship is a risk

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,720
one in which by eating through our

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,360
bandwidth may ultimately limit our

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,430
access to the outside world this isn't

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,990
necessarily a modern problem people in

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,940
love have always disappeared from the

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,590
world but they've always been able to

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,490
come back once the waves of their narrow

00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:50,890
chemical buzz have crested to limit the

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,260
scenario of an overburdened overtaxed

00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,090
and unbalanced personal network we must

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,700
embrace the quantification of

00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:59,410
relationship we have the technology to

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,120
accurately measure display not just our

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,790
personal emotional bandwidth it just

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,920
remains fluid and subjective but the

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,320
actual bandwidth incurred by our

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,910
constant communication observation and

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,760
search for information and services

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,620
regarding our partner or partners all

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,600
the traces that a relationship leaves on

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,460
the physical individual are ultimately

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,610
mutable we can break down some key

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:24,520
quantifiable variables one the time

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,980
spent on a relationship on line two the

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,510
cost of your connection and three the

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,730
bandwidth usage that relationship

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,460
entails ultimately we can arrive at a

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,440
dollar amount of precisely how much for

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,290
a bit per second of your usage was spent

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,430
on any given person repair two sets of

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,110
data like that it could effectively

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,880
alert you when your partner's interest

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,440
is waning and provide you with an

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,960
additional tool for reading state of

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,280
your partner's affections the human

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,660
interface conceals as much as it reveals

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,540
but this kind of data is bald an

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:59,920
apparent of course I'm with you

00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:01,750
I mean there's site me that probably

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,550
will happen probably will happen but

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,010
there's another option and it's much

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,230
less draconian instead of inventing

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:12,430
emotional bandwidth solutions i would

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:14,260
like to calm EBS we can just invest in

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,520
the future of our hearts we don't need

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,980
to leave the binary hunts of our

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,480
relationships behind us we decide to be

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,240
more considered with everything that we

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,100
do not just our flirtations but

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,040
everything we do online the temptation

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,390
to tag site post and discover others

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,020
through their forward-facing digital

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:34,050
avatars is great but the rewards of love

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,970
under the radar is much more profound

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,310
love undocumented is love unadvertised

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,830
and unexploited as well as an

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,050
exploitable it is love that will fade

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,760
gently like a photograph instead of

00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,520
creeping up algorithmically like a

00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,350
google image search result some might

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,880
say this is the Luddites approach but

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,580
when it comes to love we might all be

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,260
luddites who wouldn't smash the machine

00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:02,170
that told them to cisely win and where

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:04,209
they were replaced unfortunately the

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,820
global index that contains every

00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:09,160
gossamer bite of our love letters not

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,870
the ones tied under the bed pad with

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,270
velvet ribbon but the ones that we were

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,640
always writing unknowingly the ones that

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:19,060
right us as we try to make contact it

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,850
costs flat plains of heartless led it

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:25,120
