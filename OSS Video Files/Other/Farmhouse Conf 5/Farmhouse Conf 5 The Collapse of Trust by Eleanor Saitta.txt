Title: Farmhouse Conf 5 The Collapse of Trust by Eleanor Saitta
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Farmhouse Conf 5
Description: 
	When we think about collapse, the narrative that comes to mind is that of the massive environmental challenges facing us as a species, as we attempt to recover from variously boiling, acid-bathing, and poisoning ourselves. Just as real, though, is the collapse of trust that's led us to be on such a direct collision path with the end of our future. We have placed a trust in our governments to act in our interests and in our institutions to think on the kind of timescales that lone individuals often fail to, but that trust has completely collapsed. The problem of ecological collapse in the large is really a failure of governance and timescale, an issue of state capture, a failure of fundamental ethics and vision on the part of the super-empowered, a systemic, emergent nightmare.

Let's walk into that nightmare, sit with it for a while, and then see how we can walk back out.

I guess I'll lead off a little bit about

00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:12,959
me CNN Who I am I sort of wander around

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,839
the world breaking things mostly I do

00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:18,960
this when people ask me to most of the

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,910
things I break our big complex technical

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,679
and social systems and I look at how

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,199
they fail and try to make them fail in

00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,289
ways that are really useful to people

00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,880
some of the time this is you know

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,890
computer systems I do a lot of computer

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,740
security work it's also legal systems

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,789
and looking at infrastructural features

00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,020
and a lot of things but i guess where

00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,719
i'm going to start and this is probably

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,280
a reasonable place to kick this off is

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,610
you know this century is actually

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,180
looking pretty grim like you know we've

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,219
got a lot of very large long-term

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,030
catastrophes that are sort of rolling

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,039
down on us and you know it's not very

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,989
clear that we're going to make it

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,000
through a lot of them that you know all

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,650
of what we might call it Chloe call

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,090
modern civilization is really going to

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,409
have a very good very good play this

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,409
this century you know whether that's

00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,900
fossil fuel exhaustion or

00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:18,930
anthropocentric climate disruption or

00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,740
ocean acidification or biodiversity loss

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:26,310
or scarcities and many of the metals

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,020
that we use there are a lot of different

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,990
catastrophes that are sort of coming for

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,390
a modern industrial and civilizational

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,220
base and you know we might get lucky

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,840
we'll probably dodged a couple of them

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,640
and we might even solve a couple of them

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,740
but you know at least one of the any one

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,380
of them is enough to do for us and we're

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,340
probably not even dodge all of them and

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,570
that means we're going to have a we're

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,500
going to be looking at some very

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:56,310
different civilizational outcomes at the

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,590
end of that process now if we all

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,960
started working together in you know a

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,469
prompt enough fashion we might be able

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:10,320
to actually do a lot about many of these

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:11,850
issues you know not I'm not really that

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,920
interested in talking about at least

00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,950
right now about what the the specific

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,370
actions are because you know every

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,290
Christ

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,170
has it has its camp of people who talk

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,970
about you know oh we need to do X to

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,860
solve why this that you know there's

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,209
there's that those conversations are

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,459
happening which is very good I mean this

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:35,659
conversation is really important but

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:39,810
what we're not hearing so much about is

00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:41,519
I guess two things we're not hearing

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,239
that much first about the infrastructure

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,079
that these things interact with

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,400
infrastructure is one of those things

00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,599
that's really boring for most people

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,250
most people don't spend a lot of time

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,180
thinking about it I'm guessing that

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,700
there are probably a lot of exceptions

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:58,590
in this audience if you look at the

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,049
state and this is especially true in

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,180
America if you look at the state of

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,640
American infrastructure and

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,549
infrastructure that we as Americans

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,609
depend on it's it's actually deeply

00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:14,159
terrifying we have a bunch of colliding

00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:15,870
things and the collisions here are

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,709
indicative of the larger problems that

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:24,720
we're facing as well there are sort of a

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,859
series of gaps you know so we all went

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,919
and built a bunch of infrastructure

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:30,980
after world war two and we've been

00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,280
depending on that infrastructure sense

00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,260
unfortunately we haven't been

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,849
maintaining it very much because

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,069
maintenance budgets you know maintenance

00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,780
is expensive and maintenance budgets

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,849
pull from money that you'd be using for

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,799
new infrastructure so there's this

00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,480
competitive efficiency over time it sort

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,150
of slowly gradually decreases

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,440
maintenance budgets and then sometimes

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,579
they fall off a cliff like the twenty

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,540
five percent reduction in maintenance

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:59,879
spending that we've had in the past

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,859
decade there's also an issue of capacity

00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,150
a lot of this infrastructure was built

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:04,769
when it was cheaper for us to build

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,269
things it's gotten a lot more expensive

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,709
for us to build things so we've stopped

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:14,160
building the infrastructure a lot of

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,930
this infrastructure was designed under

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,979
different conditions than

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,479
we are now facing right this

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,850
infrastructure was not designed to be

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,380
flexible you know the highway system was

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,669
designed with the assumption that cars

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,650
would be the primary means of getting

00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:31,120
people around and there aren't really

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,009
that many things that you can repurpose

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,110
a highway into I mean sure you can put

00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:37,060
buses on it but it's not really designed

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,550
to be an efficient bus collector

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:45,400
structure you know just from where they

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:49,180
go etc you know fairly basic levels and

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:53,910
a lot of this leads back to a problem in

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:56,139
terms of time scale that we have been

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,870
thinking about infrastructure like the

00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:00,310
reason the reason why efficiency is used

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,139
as an excuse to stop doing maintenance

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,449
you stop doing maintenance because well

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,160
on any given five year window it makes

00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:08,919
total economic sense to stop doing

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,270
maintenance maintenance is expensive the

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,190
catastrophe won't happen for at least

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,509
another 10 or 15 years surely someone

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:18,849
will get around to fixing up bridge in

00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:22,810
Minnesota before it falls down oops so

00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:24,940
and this is where we see the tie over

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,889
into the into the bigger picture stuff

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,590
because a lot of this is about failures

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,949
and systems of governance systems of

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,960
governance or even more boring than

00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,610
infrastructure but that's actually where

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:43,409
a lot of our really critical problems

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:47,050
are coming from right now so the longest

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:50,289
sort of common mindset window that I've

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:54,669
really been able to find anyone thinking

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:56,020
on is about a 20 year lifespan and it

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,360
turns out civil servants are really

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,449
great because 20 years is half a civil

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,130
servants career by the time they're sort

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:04,930
of far enough along to have a big

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,250
picture of the world they're thinking to

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,310
the end of their career what do I want

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:12,520
to get done before I retire that's 20

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,289
years you know if you're elected

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,820
official you're thinking about your next

00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,139
term in office you're not really

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,680
thinking beyond that because you need to

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,419
think about getting arrested for years

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,120
if you're a company you're thinking

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:27,219
about next year's profits year and a

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,030
half at most honestly probably you're

00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:33,680
just thinking about next quarter profits

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,210
so that's three months and a lot of the

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,640
decisions that actually affect us our

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:41,000
supply chain decisions that happen you

00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,890
know three weeks six hours depending on

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,500
the supply chain so we have this massive

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,660
rolling set of time failures of time

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,310
scale failures because what we really

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,000
need are people thinking at two

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:55,280
centuries you know two centuries starts

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,710
to be sort of a medium amount of time

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,010
it's not long-term thinking but it's at

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,630
least sort of the middle term thinking

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,820
but we have all of these structures

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,910
which are designed well it might even

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:10,070
design which is it accidentally emerged

00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:15,020
that don't permit us to think on those

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:17,210
kinds of time scales churches turned out

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,910
to be a really great tool for thinking

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,140
in the long term universities before

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,450
they became profit centers for

00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,990
neoliberalism were also reasonably good

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,090
at thinking the long term because they

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,250
actually had structures which were

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,890
intended to last and they thought of

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,940
themselves as guardians of knowledge

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:40,460
over the centuries but as the pace of

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,330
change in knowledge has increased that

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,190
stopped and and certainly as it just

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,130
become mostly extractive things where

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,320
you know nobody really thinks about

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,580
long-term careers in academia anymore at

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,330
least not if they're you know vaguely

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,340
realistic there's a there's a great

00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,730
story out there about the about Oxford

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,350
University you know realizing that one

00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,870
of the one of the one of the great halls

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:08,270
had wrought and the beams like well this

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:11,660
is horrible because it is giant like you

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,800
know 18 24 inch thick oak beams like we

00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,050
can't replace those they don't make

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,520
trees like that anymore and you know six

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,870
months later one of the forester said oh

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,480
yeah there's this grove of trees on

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,190
campus that they were planted when we

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,660
built Paul last time they're ready now

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,280
they were built because we knew that

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,840
those beans were going to get worms in

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,340
them so we planted some trees at the

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,730
time two centuries ago and now they're

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,980
big enough to replace those beans that's

00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:37,490
weird that doesn't happen normal places

00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:39,260
Oxford is not a normal place you know

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,910
can you imagine that happening

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:46,930
UCLA you know or brooke Lee or wherever

00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:50,270
you know it doesn't it doesn't happen

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,670
but we have a lot of certain more

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,860
aggressive issues I mean we live under

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,800
condition of state capture right now you

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,940
know the notion that we have

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,610
representative democracy is a very

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,700
polite fiction which is sort of used to

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,560
keep people you know sort of feeling

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,200
okay with their amount of participation

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,940
in society you know well I went no voted

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,420
and so I've done my political duty I can

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,830
go back to whatever else i dunno you

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,390
know representative democracy as we

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,110
practice it in the West is

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:23,090
comprehensively failed you know the US

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,430
decided a while ago that it's you know

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,950
it's really not acceptable in a modern

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,200
democracy to have people bribing

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,390
politicians like this isn't okay it's

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,500
not okay that politicians break the law

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:38,240
and then arrives we need to stop this so

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,130
we legalized it now we call it lobbying

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:47,270
which just solved the problem right you

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:50,390
know so we exist in a structure of state

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:54,680
capture where it is impossible to do

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:56,660
things that operate outside of the time

00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,480
frames of the people who have captured

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:03,950
the states that we live with which means

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,460
quarters which means maybe years so it

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,960
is impossible to do long-term planning

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,360
you know you have structures of coercive

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,280
efficiency we're a city gets told well

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,020
such-and-such City closed all their

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,970
parks and all their homeless shelters

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,250
and poured that money into into tax

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,980
breaks for industry and if you don't do

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,080
it we're going over there you know and

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,030
this is this happens every day you know

00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,260
this this kind of structure it's it's

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,660
big conversations it's little

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,460
conversations but you know these are the

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:39,170
these are the conditions which we with

00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:43,580
which we live one of the a lot of this

00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:45,800
guilt well I don't want to say it's

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,820
personally the fault of the rich because

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,870
really it's the fault of the money that

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,490
motivates them and that moves them

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,000
because a lot of this is the logic of

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,270
capital

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,550
the logic of accumulative monies the

00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,250
logic of the time sequence by which

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:04,670
capital has fallen into as we've moved

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,440
from mercantilism the Industrial

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,560
Revolution through the capitalization of

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:15,140
Finance and we've gotten shorter and

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,430
shorter time horizons that said the

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:22,310
people with the money are the ones who

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:25,450
are doing this you know there are a lot

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:31,370
of things that we can do about this but

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:34,790
none of them involve the rich not having

00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,960
to change their lives and change the

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,060
influence that they have in the world

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,490
and by the rich I mean every one of you

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,950
including myself right because the

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:45,250
average wage in this world is two and a

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,200
half dollars a day we are all

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:51,940
fantastically filthily disgustingly rich

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:54,350
and the world caters to our every whim

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,720
not as much as it caters to the whims of

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,940
a few other people but you know we all

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,380
had some very nice coffee right you know

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,120
what social equality looks like social

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,500
equality looks like living under the

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:10,370
same conditions that the people who drew

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:14,480
that coffee but love it now our job if

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:17,450
we want to survive this century is to

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,880
learn how to live well without massive

00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:23,030
amounts of money and to learn how to be

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,800
poor gracefully because right now we're

00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:27,110
not very good at being poor gracefully

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,110
you know if you're poor in the West your

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,270
life is hell if you're poor anywhere

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,790
your life is some approximation of hell

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,650
but especially here and especially in

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,890
America especially in the richest

00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:42,410
country in the world we treat our poor

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,360
the worst of anywhere and we push that

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:51,050
oppression out as aggressively as

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:53,030
possible conviviality is one of the big

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,860
things that we're missing that isn't

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,810
just about income redistribution right

00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,300
you know because it's not just about

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,880
redistributing agency equally among

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,839
everyone but it's also about making sure

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,839
that

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,360
without depending on massive amounts of

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,300
money we get to live well and live well

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,950
doesn't mean you know having the

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,900
lifestyle that pays for the very nice

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,480
cameras and the air flights and all the

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,110
rest of it Living Well means actually

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,750
enjoying your life it means you know

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:30,430
having you know a nice dinner it means

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:35,200
having time to spend with friends it's

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:36,940
impossible right now to go and spend 20

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,240
years thinking about a problem in

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,760
America because you can't afford to do

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,190
it unless you already have a massive

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,140
pile of money and if you have a massive

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,580
pile of money the fact that you have

00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,690
that massive pile of money is going to

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,490
change the way you think about those

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:57,280
problems this is what the the profit

00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,880
extraction of academia has cost us among

00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,740
other things it's cost us the existence

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,080
of any place where people can go to just

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,460
think and see things out of that time

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:11,920
horizon and not need to publish a paper

00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:16,510
every three months not need to publish a

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,220
blog entry six times a day there are

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:23,080
some thoughts that you just need to sit

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:26,650
with for a very long time and the issues

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,470
that we are hitting our about those

00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:32,080
thoughts there about us not having time

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:35,880
to sit and think and understand the

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:40,030
consequences of our actions over time a

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,190
lot of these problems can be traced to

00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:45,520
in one way or another a betrayal of

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:47,320
trust you know it's it's a it's a

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,410
concentration of agency and that means a

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,500
betrayal of trust in the notion that

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:57,400
well I'll be fine if I trust these other

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,630
people to do the right thing no instead

00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,410
I'm going to take their agency away

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,640
because I can because I don't trust them

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,250
and a lot of that is about building a

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,810
cross class contact it's about building

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,190
experience and this is one of the

00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,680
reasons why I do travel as much as I do

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,910
it's about bridging communities it's

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,590
about becoming sort of one humanity

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,900
because it used to be fine well it used

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,730
to be not fine it used to be

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,110
tolerable that we were fragmented into

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,550
lots of little pockets whether they were

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:29,950
nations or religions or States or

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:33,070
whatever because our our reach didn't

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:35,590
actually go that far you know it wasn't

00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:39,610
a problem because our reach didn't

00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:41,170
exceed our vision and we we don't have

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:48,550
global vision right now but we do have

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:53,530
global reach so that's sort of the shape

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:55,030
of the problem there are kind of two two

00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,740
threads and I and I said I wasn't just

00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:01,990
going to just going to focus on the

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:03,100
problem so I'll try to honor that there

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,680
are two threats that I'm looking at a

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:11,620
lot as far as how we get back out of

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:15,390
this so decentralization is interesting

00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,890
not because it's a panacea but because

00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:22,210
decentralized structures are more

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:27,010
difficult to capture with the existing

00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:29,470
tactics that we're seeing deployed you

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:33,190
know it's a lot harder to capture

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:36,640
control of a cooperative market than it

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:39,700
is to capture control of an entity with

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,380
a single owner you know and so given

00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,860
that a lot of what we need to do is

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:46,030
redistribute agency back out

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,550
decentralization is a fairly natural

00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:50,050
place to start now it's not enough you

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,150
also have to ensure that you get the

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,840
kind of Liberatore potential woven into

00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:57,430
the ethics that you you intend to

00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,650
decentralize because if you don't have

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,800
both it doesn't work but the

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:05,710
decentralization is a prerequisite now

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,260
what an institution does you know

00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:10,240
whether it's a government or corporation

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,760
is it basically execute a bunch of

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,710
processes and then it has a certain

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,030
amount of tacit memory the tacit

00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,980
memories all the stuff that it doesn't

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,750
write down about how the process is

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,000
actually work and its understanding of

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,280
the world that one's a little bit harder

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,010
but on the process side it actually

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:30,630
turns out to be very easy relatively

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:32,169
speaking to turn any given set of

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,690
organizational process

00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:36,429
is into a set of protocols that a

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,669
distributed decentralized group of

00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:42,309
people can execute now you still need an

00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:44,019
institution you still need someone to

00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:46,210
hang on to that knowledge and say hey

00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:47,799
this is how this works this is how that

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,679
works whether it's teaching new people

00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:53,139
to come into the network or providing a

00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:57,119
space for reflection inside that

00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:59,289
decentralized group but that gives you a

00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,600
decentralization of agency and that's

00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,549
one of your prerequisites now there's a

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,460
lot of technical stuff that you can do

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,809
to support decentralization although in

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,259
the end a lot of it isn't strictly

00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:15,279
required but technology can be enabling

00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:19,440
here and this is I'm not a techno

00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:22,989
optimist exactly but I do think that

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,669
technology influences the society and

00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:26,799
society can shape the technology that we

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:28,989
build and we can have a positive

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,239
feedback loop here if we decide to

00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:34,659
commit to building the technology that

00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:35,799
gives us the world that we want most of

00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:37,090
the governance systems that we have

00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,129
right now that have been so thoroughly

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,899
captured were designed when horses were

00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:43,299
a really fast way of moving information

00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:45,989
around the country that's not true

00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:50,259
anymore which means that we have

00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:52,929
basically a lot of a lot of slop a lot

00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:57,179
of time slop in the system now what's

00:18:52,929 --> 00:19:00,519
happened is that the media and the

00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:02,590
people who would influence and reshape

00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,480
that system have absorbed all of that

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,769
time slot which is why we have the 24

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,600
hour news cycle all these other things

00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,809
despite having this much slower

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,090
political system we can accelerate the

00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:16,029
actual governance system up to something

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,220
that's a little bit closer to the speed

00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:21,519
at which information moves now and it

00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:24,549
drives out a lot of that attention which

00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,470
is frankly kind of hostile now obviously

00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:28,119
we have to do so in a way which gives us

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,009
time to think about these decisions and

00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:31,899
that kind of thing it's not it's not

00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:34,940
perfect but you can think of that time

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:38,730
slot this room too

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:41,280
room to make more or room to make less

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,660
efficient systems representative

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,880
democracy the notion of having

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,560
representatives is a system of

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,030
efficiency right it's a system of well

00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,050
not everybody can have input to every

00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:53,580
problem which is necessary when you have

00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,230
slow communication when you have fast

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,900
communication more people can have input

00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:00,210
more people can have agency a system

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,730
becomes less harder to capture so we

00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,110
need less efficient government I know

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,180
it's kind of hilarious to stand here in

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,340
California champion less efficient

00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,020
government but we need government which

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,760
is less efficient in the Liberatore way

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,380
not government which is less efficient

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:18,870
in a way that encourages that kind of

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:20,900
capture which is what we have now just

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,580
the technical side isn't enough though

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,100
we also need social prototyping and this

00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,840
is something that is it done very much

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,550
right now you know we basically build

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,440
technical systems and just sort of say

00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,060
well whatever the system ends up meeting

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,590
in society that's fine because it's

00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:39,930
technology and it's disruption and

00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:41,400
that's good right yeah there there's a

00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,660
whole pile of unemployed people out

00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,860
there who'd be happy to talk to you

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,590
about your opinions about disruptive

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:50,000
technology if you if you believe in that

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:55,590
which I assume most of you here don't

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,440
but we need to have systems that let us

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,090
look at the structures that we're going

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,670
to deploy before they're deployed at

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,080
mass scale before it's too late to

00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:09,090
change our minds on what they actually

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:13,170
ended up meaning so one of the other

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:15,510
random worlds I plan is the Scandinavian

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:17,580
LARP scene Scandinavian live action role

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:20,190
playing scene which is this hilarious

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,690
wacky little corner of the world and

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,970
they started out the same way all of the

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,050
other workers did running out of the

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,050
woods and hitting each other with foam

00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:31,860
swords and you know and it was exactly

00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:33,510
that and then because Scandinavia is a

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,030
kind of a communal asiah T in ways that

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,170
we aren't as people grew up they were

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,270
like well what if we tell real stories

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,400
you know because we're taking this stuff

00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:44,850
fairly seriously already and we already

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,770
have a notion that we can dive into

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,430
emotions because everybody is here to

00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:50,190
support

00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:54,420
everyone else's story not to get to play

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,770
the hero and they started telling

00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,250
stories about things which actually mean

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:01,500
things the first game I played in that

00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,220
community was called just at 11 it was a

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:09,660
three-day game played outside of Oslo

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:12,570
but set in a beach house or a you know

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,000
summer house on the Hudson over three

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,820
consecutive fourth of July parties in 82

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,280
83 and 84 in the gay scene of the start

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,650
of the AIDS epidemic and was played with

00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,010
the level of seriousness that that topic

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:30,210
deserves and it was incredibly difficult

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:33,690
than an incredibly moving experience you

00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:36,060
know it taught me a lot about what parts

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:39,660
of the history of the queer community

00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:43,080
that I'm part of actually meant you know

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:45,330
because I sort of had an intellectual

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,650
understanding or whatever but an

00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,140
intellectual understanding is very

00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,640
different than not you but someone else

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,530
having borrowed your body for a little

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,430
while to bury a friend of theirs that

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,660
they'd known for ten years now that was

00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:00,840
about understanding what a piece of

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:03,840
history meant but the same tool kit gets

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:07,830
used for thinking about what new social

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,990
structures made it interests me because

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:14,370
it's the first time I've seen anywhere

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:18,570
this kind of high fidelity emotionally

00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:21,150
closed first-person present tense plural

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,610
approach to storytelling that lets you

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:27,990
really live a structure in the world and

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:30,660
figure out what it means and I think

00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,100
that that toolkit combined with an

00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:36,270
understanding of decentralization

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:38,100
combined with a thorough effort at real

00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,530
meaningful governance change and not

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,260
like lobbying Congress are trying to get

00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,270
news laws passed but building things in

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,490
the world actively going on in building

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:49,740
things because a lot of the things that

00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,830
we care about a lot of the things that

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,870
are causing these massive horrifyingly

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,360
terrible long-term problems that are

00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:00,780
going to kill us all our infrastructure

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,430
and what we need our new infrastructure

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,740
that change the way the world works and

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,390
it turns out that a lot of the time you

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,390
don't have to wait to ask anybody's

00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:13,860
permission to build new infrastructure

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:15,750
certainly over didn't now uber and the

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,100
labor market might have a few things to

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,510
say to each other if we want to talk

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:23,070
about Liberatore effects of technology

00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:26,580
but you know you don't have to be over

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:30,080
you don't even have to be zipcar you

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,550
know you can build systems which have

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,980
good economic and ecological benefits

00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:38,010
leave value on the table promote

00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,560
decentralization promote collective

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,480
community decision-making and you can do

00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,130
so without just sort of blindly pushing

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,660
stuff out there because it's disruptive

00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,370
and different and you can actually

00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:50,400
understand the impact your heaven in the

00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:54,660
world if you take it upon yourself to

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,510
say gee you know my kids my kids kids my

00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:00,210
friends kids who ever you know our

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,670
species those other people who are human

00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:06,540
who's suffering matters just as much as

00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:08,190
mine if not more they need to have just

00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,440
as much of a chance as I've got they

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,030
need to have the nice lifestyle with

00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,530
anywhere they get to sit under avocado

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:19,170
trees and have nice toys and you know

00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:21,960
you can build this but first it's about

00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,820
collective responsibility and it's about

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,720
thinking about the impacts that our

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,720
actions have on the world

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,820
you

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,380
