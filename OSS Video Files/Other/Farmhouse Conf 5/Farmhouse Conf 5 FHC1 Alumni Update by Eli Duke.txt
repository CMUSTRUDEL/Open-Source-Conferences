Eli Duke is our next speaker Eli is

00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,910
nate's a little brother by four years he

00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,499
was in eighth grade when we were seniors

00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,800
I was never actually in school with him

00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:19,900
but after meeting Nate's going sledding

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,570
and of what I eventually made it over to

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,490
the Duke house after a few months and

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,350
met this little guy who was you know

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,990
about half as tall but the same size

00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:34,329
head and he was even more of a nerd than

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,820
than he is now we would watch like you

00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:39,370
know Nat Geo TV and like cooking shows

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:43,180
and stuff and are you gonna talk about

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,530
ballistic us know okay so Eli Nate and

00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,690
our other friend Matt used to really

00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,890
bully Eli because they knew they could

00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,989
push his buttons to the point where you

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,440
just like go apeshit and totally was

00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:54,700
like 02 Hulk smash in like 15 seconds

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,010
but they treated it like a nature show

00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,230
like here we have an it Eli's ballistic

00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,530
kiss in the wild he's just eating some

00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,899
of whatever so Eli is going to give us

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,820
this is his third time here he spoke at

00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:10,180
the first one and then read an update at

00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:17,740
two yeah and then here again at five hey

00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:20,070
buddy everybody so um at the first farm

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,630
house I thought it was really cool that

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,450
forget maybe was the last speaker was

00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:28,180
saying like harvest set let you

00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,280
harvested thrive the chain want to do

00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,990
this thing but he didn't feel like he

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,600
had to go reach out to far he could just

00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,680
go to his close friends and miu know see

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,320
if they have interesting things to talk

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,610
about so the first farm house was a lot

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,340
of his close friends and so he asked me

00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,840
if I would speak about my job which at

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,720
that point was doing season work in

00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,310
Antarctica and so I came and I talked

00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,650
about it it was fun and I talked about

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:58,330
working down there and traveling and the

00:01:53,650 --> 00:02:03,040
whatnot and I did for summer seasons I

00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,450
which is like October to februari and it

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,909
was it was a lot of fun it was very

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,619
interesting but I wasn't I felt like in

00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,689
the end I wasn't creating anything very

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,190
lasting you know you go there and you

00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:13,330
work and you come home and you see some

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,200
friends than you leave again and you're

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:20,150
not like building anything and so

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,020
for me after doing four seasons of that

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,220
I felt like I need to one um sort of

00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,140
disconnect from the Antarctic Program

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,260
because I know people that go years and

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:35,480
years and years and never break out of

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:37,940
that cycle and also that I needed to

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,490
build something a little more tangible a

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,170
little bit more lasting so I had been

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,380
living kind of in the Seattle Portland

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,730
area in between seasons and my brother

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,850
had just moved to Portland and so I

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,080
thought like that would be a good place

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,600
and it really has it's been very

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,040
wonderful sort of reconnecting and you

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,160
know there's sort of like the grass is

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,350
always greener people would see the

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,120
lifestyle I was living and say that's

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,700
amazing but I would see the lifestyle

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,020
that people were living where they had

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:10,310
you know like friends around all the

00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,620
time and had like sort of like weekly

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,390
little gatherings or meet ups or

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,800
potlucks or whatever and I was like

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,840
craving that sort of thing and then at

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,110
one point I found myself at a bonfire

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,790
with I think he was a National

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,730
Geographic photographer talking about

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,440
traveling and he was saying right in the

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,060
middle of me trying to figure out like

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,640
do I want to keep doing this thing or do

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,030
I want to settle down or how do I wrap

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,010
my brain around this and um he said he

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,230
was a little bit older than 55 or so and

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,580
he said okay well I'll give you some

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,280
advice if you want it and I thought like

00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:50,630
all right grandpa you know like what can

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,330
you tell me you know and he said um that

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,970
you should travel when you can as much

00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,340
as you can but you absolutely have to

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:01,130
have a home base if you don't have a

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,810
place of friends and people that you are

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,370
building something with something that's

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,700
lasting something that's more than these

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,580
sort of fleeting kind of adventures or

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,220
whatever then it's kind of for nothing

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,669
you can't just like constantly wonder

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,500
you have to some place to go home to and

00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:22,040
so it was really wonderful in that

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:26,419
moment in that space but not really able

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,820
to put such a fine point on it he sort

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,910
of laid it out there pretty simply and

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,440
surprise meal I was not expect

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:37,390
something you know his advice to be so

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:43,430
powerful to me so I took a tart and

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:45,260
that's what I did for that year but it

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,330
was a nice little dipping my toe in it

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,900
and then I went back tenerife again this

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,310
last season and sort of him at the point

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,310
now where I've kind of had my fill of

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,110
that and I'm back in Portland and sort

00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,390
of settling in and doing some of the

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,340
things that I couldn't do when I was

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:08,780
sort of like on the move all the time

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:12,520
and it's nice it definitely is good to

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,520
sort of have that balance I think and

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:20,750
it's weird being really excited for me

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,700
it's it's fun and it's very exciting to

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,920
just think like oh I can't wait to just

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,710
like go to work Monday through Friday

00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,110
and then come home and then just like

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,580
hang out and make some dinner and then

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,410
go to sleep and go to work the next day

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,180
and and then on the weekend go and hang

00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,140
out with friends and you know it doesn't

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:42,020
sound exciting and it's hard to if

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:45,770
that's your all the time to sort of take

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:48,880
that for granted but it's the little

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,370
things of meeting up with friends and

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,350
you know like helping them paint their

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,610
room or something like that or helping

00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:00,500
them do little things that don't seem

00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,940
like that's much of a deal so to connect

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,440
this a little bit sort of just a little

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:07,790
side story of collapse how much time do

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,580
I have changed okay so I didn't go this

00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,780
back this past season anak you know some

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,140
would say it was a good idea some would

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,030
say wasn't not a good idea but um the

00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,130
government shutdown that we all heard

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,750
about for so long you sort of think like

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,970
oh who's that really affect you know

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,940
like I don't really know anybody maybe I

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,340
do maybe don't but the government

00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,350
shutdown directly hit the NSF which

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,910
directly hit the United States an art

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,320
program and it turned out all of a

00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,790
sudden that was in national news I was

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,200
hearing about on the NPR that people

00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,030
were being sent home and I had friends

00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,860
that got all the way down to

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,990
Christchurch New Zealand and then were

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,010
sent home or people that went and got

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,180
there and they were there for a couple

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,560
days and then got sent home

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,060
um and so you know it was like this the

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,310
government shutdown the collapse of that

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,460
was like seriously pulling people out of

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,350
there and it was sort of weird hearing

00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,509
about these things about my friends on

00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,759
you know sort of like national news like

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,370
driving to work a little update on NPR

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,169
which was kind of cool but they're sort

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,000
of spooling back up and getting going

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,060
again and they're going to try to make

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,900
the most of this season if they can so

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:23,300
there you have it I'm gonna do a little

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:29,030
light of you here so can you hear me

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:30,830
focus ok what you did you have friends

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,320
there went in Christchurch when the

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,449
earthquake hit tube I did yeah you know

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,090
this this this random dinner you had

00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:40,099
with some aunt uncle's friend who is a

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,440
dentist so yeah like shaped your life in

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:46,940
the next six years in all these like big

00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,680
world it's sort of like how Forrest Gump

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,150
was just this guy but ended up like in

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,650
all these sort of like historical things

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,349
yeah you can say you could say I'm

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,320
somewhat of a modern day for us now yeah

00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:58,970
definitely look the part I'll take that

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,639
what so you didn't talk about the ice

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,110
much so what is one thing that would

00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:08,090
really surprise people that's that

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,099
people don't expect um well i would say

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,940
probably the most surprising to people

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:16,430
is that on New Year's Eve that evening

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,259
like leading up to the countdown is an

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,840
outdoor music festival with probably

00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:24,860
like 10 or 15 bands of the local

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,270
community is called I stock and the

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,440
first of the year is usually the warmest

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,300
time of the year because the summertime

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,970
there so that's like right smack in the

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,219
middle and if it's usually it's a sunny

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,289
day and it's warm and it's like 45

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:39,700
degrees and you could be outside the

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:42,589
t-shirt and it's really quite pleasant

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,240
and what what's the coolest thing you

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:47,750
are found in school or tell what school

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,220
is uh school it is a type of us like a

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,079
seagull like an anorexic oh they're

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,390
brown and brutal and they eat baby

00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:55,760
penguins and make nests out of rocks

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:59,150
they are so hard

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,630
they're so hard on and then there's also

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,250
they they're kind of like just a

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:07,070
scavenger in a lot of ways and so

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,410
there's sort of a free cycle in the

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,420
United States and our program that's

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,830
called Skua where like if you have a

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,570
sweatshirt you don't care about anymore

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,270
but still decent you there's like

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,310
drop-off locations around town you can

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,960
drop those off and then they're gathered

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,370
in a central place and you can go to

00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,260
that central place and it's almost like

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,860
you're kind of going shopping but sort

00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:31,940
of drifting and you know the coolest

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:36,740
thing ever found in school um sort of a

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,570
tough one what's that oh yeah so Nate

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,540
who just spoke with Lego he has a pretty

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:44,450
intense 8-bit Nintendo collection like

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:48,410
basically every title and I found some

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:51,320
weird soap it was like in the shape of

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,210
an 8-bit Nintendo game and it was like

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,520
in one of those black sleeves that they

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,040
came in you know and he even had like a

00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,900
sticker of like of an actual game it was

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,660
a bubble bobble yeah cells bubble bobble

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,790
it was like and as like I this is

00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,830
amazing and so I I held on to it give it

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,480
to when I got home all right what last

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,220
time you've how many times have you been

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,860
to the South Pole as part of going to

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,510
McMurdo just once so McMurdo is sort of

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,310
right on the coast my boyfriend the

00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,020
coast right by yourself a new zealand

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:21,550
south of christchurch and then how far

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:24,950
is the trek to the South Pole bus there

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:28,100
it's about three hours it's about eight

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,920
or nine hundred miles okay did you ever

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,440
go by land no I did not go by land just

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,910
flow as well give us one anecdote about

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,890
the south pole um it's like it's like

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,120
mythical place basalt yeah a lot of

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,410
people think that I go to the South Pole

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,580
it's like you go to a target you're at

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:50,300
the South Pole but the South Pole is its

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:51,350
own little like pocket and I'd say one

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,410
of the strange things about it is that

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:58,940
it is at about 10,000 feet elevation but

00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:00,410
that's all ice it's like the land is at

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,470
sea level are actually below sea level

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,360
right there and there's two miles of ice

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,780
and that's what makes it a high

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,680
elevation thing and so um you forget

00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,450
that a lot and just

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,980
walking around there it's like you're at

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,690
dinner and you get up and you're walking

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,550
maybe you go up some stairs and you take

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,410
two or three steps and you have to like

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:23,510
stop and hold on to the railing and like

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:25,250
I just breathe because you sort of

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,810
forget that they're at elevation it

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,029
doesn't it's like you look out and it's

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,980
all just flat it's just endless the flat

00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:32,779
white as I call it just the endless

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,459
straight line of a horizon so doesn't

00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:36,380
feel like you're in mountains or you're

00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:38,149
at a high place and so you have to like

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,980
they remind you when you first get their

00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,230
drink a lot of water and just walk very

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,750
slowly and if you drop something don't

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,120
immediately bend over to pick it up cuz

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,279
you'll just like fall over and pass out

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,970
it's like oh I drop that that's like mom

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,930
