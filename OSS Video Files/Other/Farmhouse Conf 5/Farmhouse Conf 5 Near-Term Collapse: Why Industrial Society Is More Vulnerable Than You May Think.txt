Description: 
	by Richard Heinberg

Rising energy costs, crushing debt burdens, resource depletion, and climate change are converging to undermine the global economy. Our political system appears incapable of responding. Previous civilizations have collapsed in the face of similar challenges. What does collapse look like? Is it likely within the next two decades? If so, what should we be doing?

so the years 2004 I I'm on this

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:17,310
I own a black you know GMC safari

00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:19,080
minivan I go on this road trip with a

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,300
couple friends like a tour like book and

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,950
film tour like too many tours on tour we

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,350
kind of had our moment we kind of like

00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,770
broke up and then I drove back home to

00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:35,460
Indiana I meet up with Eli and the

00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,589
younger Duke kid Hannah and the three of

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,600
us proceeded to drive Hannah out to

00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:41,519
Seattle for school

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,739
we hang out there for a minute my van

00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:45,960
breaks down I have to like calling the

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,960
friend like borrow money just to fix it

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,440
to drive to what was going to be home in

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,960
San Francisco and so I finally get the

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,429
van fixed I'm like this I

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,429
Seattle like I had a good time but it's

00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,659
just like it defeated me I'm out of here

00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:02,969
and this was like Seattle summer not

00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:08,340
even like the winter times and I'm

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:10,229
driving down was it the five and I'm

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,520
listening to like whatever the NPR is up

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,829
there and I don't see Helens had sort of

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,420
burped that day it wasn't it like an

00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:20,460
eruption was just I got a steam birth

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,590
well like oh the world is going

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,619
like explode I need to just drive far

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,270
away in one direction and I was on this

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,210
like freshly paved road or like a

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,609
blacktop version of Paves whatever is

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,719
just like smelly and like brand-new no

00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:38,369
lines yet and I turn on NPR and lo and

00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,350
behold it was whatever show where they

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,390
interview author of the books and it was

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,759
this guy talking about this this idea

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,109
called peak oil and his book that he

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,109
just written called power downer that

00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:52,649
was Richard Heinberg and I was like yes

00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:55,590
this is this is he speaking my language

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,450
I hadn't quite like articulated you know

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,999
I hadn't gotten to the peak oil stuff

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,409
yet and but he was just saying all these

00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:05,069
things that wanting definitely yes went

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,780
home got the book call up Eli he also

00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,149
got the book and then it was sort of the

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,390
only book at the time that was either

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,620
not super geological or only talked

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,780
about sort of peak oil

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,050
you know resource depletion tan gently

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,440
yes this is my book and then we did a

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,510
little like two-person book club and and

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,830
again like the best thing about like

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,880
throwing your own conference is you get

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,710
to call it people who are just like

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,420
otherwise like a name on a book in

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,459
Barnes & Noble if you remember that

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,590
place and it's like you know that's a

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:37,209
different world and turns out you could

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,400
just call people up and say like come to

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:43,090
my backyard

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,010
I'll have food there so 10 years later I

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,780
finally got to meet this guy and have

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:54,970
them talk to my backyard so here you go

00:02:46,780 --> 00:03:00,040
Richard how that was one of my favorite

00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:01,890
introductions ever thank you let me

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,330
start by telling you the story of

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,110
Desdemona Texas how many of you have

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,570
been to Desdemona Texas nobody ok it's

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:14,320
not surprising it's basically just at

00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:17,860
this point it's just a crossroads about

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:22,090
halfway between Fort Worth and Abilene

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:25,299
but back in 1920 Desdemona

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:28,390
was a happening place in nineteen in

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:30,880
1918 oil was discovered outside a

00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:34,570
Desdemona and within a few months

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,540
thousands of people had shown up hoping

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:41,170
to make a fortune and fortunes were

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,970
quickly made more often on trading of

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,180
stock shares than on actual oil

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,000
production but nevertheless millions of

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,280
dollars changed hands and fortunes were

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,910
lost just as quickly as they were made

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,549
in in robberies and collapses of stock

00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,549
values because what happened was within

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,930
just a few years oil production from

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,880
that field that had been discovered

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:09,970
outside of Desdemona started declining

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:13,750
and it was it was a typical boomtown you

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,600
know there were gambling robberies

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,519
prostitution the Texas Rangers showed up

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,220
and they ran the town for a while using

00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:28,110
really modern techniques like targeted

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:28,110
killing and enhanced interrogation

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:36,979
but you know but by the 1930s Desdemona

00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:39,050
was was this they closed the school in

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,000
the post office and basically there's

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,039
nothing there's nothing left there why

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,500
do I mention Desdemona because it's the

00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:47,870
template not yet not only for all

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,530
boomtowns but really for civilization

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:55,550
itself and especially for our modern

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:58,160
industrial civilization why so well I

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,580
got the first clue to that back when I

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,560
was 21 years old in 1972 and do a little

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,740
simple math tells you I'm 63 years old

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,080
mm-hmm

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,509
I read a book called limits to growth

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,680
was published that year it was a book

00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:18,680
that was written by a team of scientists

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:24,289
at MIT they were they were students of a

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:27,770
fledgling field called Systems Theory

00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:30,520
and they they had used a computer to

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,599
model the likely interactions between

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:39,169
population growth resource depletion and

00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:42,620
environmental impacts so they fed the

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:44,570
the best known values relevant to these

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,490
subjects into the computer and what came

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,770
out were a series of scenarios and the

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,940
standard run scenario showed a peak and

00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:54,770
decline in world industrial output in

00:05:51,940 --> 00:06:00,050
the first couple of decades of the 21st

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:02,690
century basically right about now but

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,280
they well they published these scenario

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,750
studies in the book limits to growth

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,259
which went on to become the best-selling

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:11,150
environmental book of all time

00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:13,070
conventional economists hated it because

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,669
they they didn't want to believe that

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,400
there were any limits to economic growth

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:21,349
but just in the last few years the major

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,659
Australian scientific research

00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:25,130
organization CSIRO the Commonwealth

00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:27,110
Scientific and Industrial Research

00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,659
Organisation did a retrospective

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,900
analysis of the limits to grow study

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:35,779
from 1972 and they found that most of

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:40,460
the values of the parameters that have

00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:41,390
emerged since 1972 have tracked the

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,420
standard

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:47,450
scenario pretty closely within about 15%

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,950
which is you know at from a certain

00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:55,400
perspective that's good news we're right

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:59,330
on track so how is this actually shaking

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:04,700
out in real time well in I'd like to

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:06,170
unpack three parameters and and suggest

00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,790
that's you know these are these are

00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,830
important things to look at now that

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:14,570
they're not the only things but they're

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:16,490
energy debt and climate energy first

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,400
energy first because it's the most

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:23,000
important thing in the world literally

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,310
without energy nothing happens and in

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,900
many ways our modern industrial way of

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:31,030
life is is all due to the fact that we

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,410
have available

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:37,220
amazing sources of energy that no

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:40,240
previous human society had namely fossil

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,580
fuels because fossil fuels have been so

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,530
abundant cheap and concentrated they've

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,360
enabled us to do things that human

00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:51,020
beings have never done before remember

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,600
it takes energy to do everything so if

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,430
you have lots of cheap energy you can do

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,400
amazing things you can go to the moon

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:02,690
you can do all the things that we take

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,520
for granted today so what's the problem

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,340
with that well of course fossil fuels

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,730
are depleting non-renewable resources so

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,530
like Desdemona Texas where we are a kind

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,260
of civilizational boomtown that's

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:21,440
running through the available fossil

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:24,590
fuels as fast as we possibly can now is

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,790
this a problem in in the short term yes

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:31,550
actually US oil production has been

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,170
declining since about 1970 most

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,450
oil-producing countries are seeing

00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:38,060
declining production in general the oil

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:42,650
industry has over the past decade

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:44,900
doubled its rate of investment but

00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,360
actual world oil production is stalled

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,840
out since about 2005 now you can fudge

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,960
that if you call biofuels oil or natural

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,930
gas liquids like

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,820
propane and butane and so on which you

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,220
know we don't use for the same purposes

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,899
as regular old crude oil and so on but

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,210
if you just look at regular crude oil

00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,460
it's been flatlined for the first time

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,920
since the beginning of the oil age and

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,160
oil is really important because it's all

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,450
of our transportation people virtually

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,660
yeah there are a few electric cars and

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:20,180
electric trams and so on but 95% of

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:24,920
transportation is oil and that means the

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,290
account is transportation so essentially

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,810
the whole economy is running on oil so

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,970
if oil is getting more expensive scarce

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,980
hard to produce that has an impact on

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,010
the economy that's one of the reasons

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,899
we're seeing stagnating economic growth

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,510
these days now of course you've heard

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:45,320
that US oil production is going up as a

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:48,230
result of fracking in places like North

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,839
Dakota and South Texas problem solved

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,690
right well what's actually happened is

00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:57,560
the price of oil has gone so far up that

00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:01,400
it justifies the extraction of the very

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,720
worst kinds of resources that geologists

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,700
have known about for a very long time

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,990
but thought were just too crappy to

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:13,430
bother with including tar sands in

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:16,910
Alberta and also the the the tight oil

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,800
as geologists call it in North Dakota

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,279
and South Texas and a few other places

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,440
my organisation post carbon Institute

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,980
recently did the most thorough study

00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,500
that's been done to date of both shale

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,260
gas and tight oil production in the u.s.

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:37,040
we we bought the proprietary rights to

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,560
data on all of the 65,000 currently

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,329
producing shale gas and tight oil wells

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,850
we looked at initial production rates

00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:46,250
production rates over time geographic

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,600
location of each well what we found is

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:53,180
that in each of the plays were

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,010
geographic geologic formations where

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,649
these fuels are being produced there

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,529
there's a core area where production is

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:02,600
fairly prolific and profitable but get

00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:05,150
outside of that core area initial

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,120
production rates are low the rate at

00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:11,750
which production declines is Savage

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,850
decline rates of 60 70 80 percent in the

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,710
first year so that means the companies

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,360
have to drill and drill and drill just

00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,390
to keep production steady much less

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,160
increase it the result is we're we're

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:26,000
almost certainly going to see a peak of

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,570
production in these areas by about 2017

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,270
and a rapid decline thereafter okay the

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,640
other organizations like the US

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,710
Department of Energy are gradually

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,400
catching up with our analysis but they

00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:42,950
they listen for the most part to the the

00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,230
the drillers who have every incentive to

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,460
overstate reserves and potential

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,040
production because that's what key

00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,840
thirst keeps their stock value up all of

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,610
these companies mostly small companies

00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,630
we're not talking about the Big Boy's

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,790
Shell Exxon Mobil and so on they're all

00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:01,070
heavily leveraged highly in debt and so

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,660
they're there for their you know their

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,060
whole business model depends upon

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:09,650
maintaining high stock values high

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:11,300
values of the the drilling leases that

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,250
they have obtained by the millions of

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,530
acres and now they're they're mostly

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,120
subsisting not on actual sales of

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:20,390
product this is especially true with

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,430
shale gas but resale of leases if they

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,810
can talk up the value of the leases so

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,330
it's basically another bubble it's

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:29,600
another real estate bubble but just in

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,550
the form of shale gas and tight oil

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,020
production and we've been told that we

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,940
have a hundred years of cheap natural

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,620
gas the u.s. is about to become energy

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:41,660
independent and so none of this is true

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:44,630
so we're actually in a bit of a bind

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:49,460
because over the short term we are going

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:52,850
to be seeing declining world oil

00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:55,190
production u.s. natural gas production

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,950
is going to start declining with within

00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:01,850
well within this decade that's going to

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:06,020
have major economic impacts okay that's

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:08,030
one energy second is debt well we hear a

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,890
lot about the problem of debt mostly

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,570
people talking about government debt

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,180
that's not how I want to attack this at

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,560
all if you want to understand our debt

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,420
dilemma you have to start at the

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,150
beginning of the 20th century when our

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,650
problem was overproduction because we

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,600
had cheap fossil fuel

00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,610
and powered assembly lines we could make

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,740
stuff faster and in larger quantities

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,230
than people were used to using or buying

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,820
it so that the solution that was hit

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:36,230
upon by industrialists manufacturers was

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,020
consumerism basically advertising

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,060
talking people into wanting and buying

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:44,210
more stuff that could only go so far

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:48,080
because people only had so much money so

00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:51,080
by the time people started maxing out

00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,230
the amount of readily available income

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,140
they had around the 1970s the next

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,060
solution was helping people to go deeper

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,520
in debt so that they could consume more

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,550
because by this time economic growth had

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,190
become a way of life our economy had

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,810
been built around economic growth by

00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,210
this point it wasn't in the that wasn't

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:14,180
true in the 17th or 18th century but by

00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:16,010
the the mid 20th century we had gotten

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,580
used to having evermore cheap energy

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:23,630
with which to make the economy

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:25,670
continually expand so in order for the

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:29,390
economy to expand people had to

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:35,080
constantly buy more stuff we had created

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:38,480
akin the first consumer economy and

00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,200
increasing household debt played a huge

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,730
role in that so since about 1970

00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,300
household debt has expanded at about

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:49,790
three times the rate of GDP growth okay

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,680
so that's kept the economy growing but

00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,750
that's not a strategy that you can

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:59,690
implement forever you run into you

00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:01,790
not everybody can you know take on that

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,320
make the payments on that much debt and

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,209
the bank doesn't want to loan you

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,260
anymore beyond a certain point and

00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:11,810
around 2008 around the time of the

00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:15,740
collapse of the housing bubble we also

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:18,440
ran into basic limits to household and

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,970
consumer debt in this country and many

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,560
other industrial countries around the

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:25,700
world the solution to that has been

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,610
government deficit spending and

00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,560
quantitative easing you know if it

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,690
weren't for those things the entire

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,580
financial system of the US would have

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:38,550
collapsed and we would be living in

00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,380
what would be obviously a rerun of the

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,300
Great Depression only only probably

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,390
worse but we've we've had--we've

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,880
we've managed to bail ourselves out and

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,680
we're doing so continually now of course

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,510
there are politicians who say well we

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,710
know there's a terrible government debt

00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,860
terrible thing we should cut off

00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:57,300
quantitative easing and get rid of

00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,510
government deficit spending if we were

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,610
to do that we would be plunged

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:06,330
immediately into depression once again

00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:08,940
but are these strategies of you know

00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:11,100
quantitative easing in printing money

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,840
and deficit spending are these

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,140
strategies that can be continued in

00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:20,160
perpetuity well maybe yes maybe no we'll

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:23,040
find out but the the evidence suggests

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,440
that we're on life-support essentially

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,080
we've reached these limits to growth

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,420
that were discussed you know 40 years

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:35,630
ago and it that's showing up in a

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,710
fundamental problem with economic growth

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,530
primarily in the previously

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:43,470
industrialized world okay the third area

00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:45,900
where we're bumping up against limits is

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,240
in the environment and of course this

00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,130
shows up in climate change I'm not going

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,690
to talk about this in any in any great

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:55,950
depth if you if you as I do have

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,630
opportunity from time to time to spend

00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,600
time with environmental scientists

00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:03,390
climate scientists and so on you quickly

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,970
understand that you know things are much

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,250
worse than we're being told a few months

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,190
ago I had the privilege of sitting next

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,949
to Sylvia Earle one of the great

00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:18,780
oceanographers National Geographic

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:20,550
fellow and we both given talks in a city

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,560
in Norway and we were so we were sitting

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,970
on next to each other on the plane and

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,010
I'd heard her talk and I'm it's

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,959
basically saying are our things really

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,030
that bad and she turned to me and she

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:37,520
said the way we're going right now the

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:40,470
oceans will be dead by 2050 okay so

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,450
enough said there are environmental

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,540
limits there are environmental sink

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:48,750
limits that we are that we are

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:52,900
approaching at the same time

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:55,330
so collapse is is not something

00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,060
theoretical and more and more people who

00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,700
watch these trends are coming to the

00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,020
conclusion that we are facing a kind of

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,180
civilizational collapse

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:07,870
now this shouldn't be surprising in fact

00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:10,590
there's the collapse Studies is a

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,890
booming field of studies right now in

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:17,110
sociology anthropology and history

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:19,840
you've probably seen Jared Diamond's

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,850
book collapse it's by far not the best

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,250
book on the subject I would recommend

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,860
Joseph's painters book the collapse of

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:30,040
complex societies which was really the

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:33,240
the spark that that started collapse

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:37,800
studies painter makes the point that

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,800
complexity is really the essence of

00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,700
civilizations higher society completely

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,710
and it's a problem solving strategy but

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,020
it has costs associated with it it

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,630
entails especially higher energy costs

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,970
in order to build a complex society you

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,800
have to invest energy right so we we've

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,650
had lots of energy we built an amazingly

00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:00,730
complex society but the investment of

00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:03,850
energy in building complexity yields

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:06,160
diminishing returns over time and so

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,460
every civilization that's existed has

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,900
collapsed every past civilization I

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,790
should say there have been something

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:18,570
like 15,000 recorded human cultures in

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:21,610
the in human history each with an

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,080
identifiable language and customs and so

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,350
on but there have only been about 24

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,000
civilizations these are really unusual

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:31,420
events in human history all of them have

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,570
collapsed and here we are having built

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,940
the the first really global civilization

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,390
the first electronic the first fossil

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,190
fueled civilization amazing thing and

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:44,140
we're tracing out the same trajectory as

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,270
all of those previous civilizations the

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:49,960
same trajectory as Damone as Desdemona

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:53,260
Texas for that matter who what does that

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,150
mean how do we how do we how do we

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,510
conceptualize that what do we do about

00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,120
it

00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:01,120
well that's that's basically what I've

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,960
spent my entire adult life thinking

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,510
about since I

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:10,029
read limits to growth you know forty

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:12,210
years ago and all of us who stay awake

00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:15,010
at night thinking about these issues

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,840
really have come up would have come to a

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:20,649
similar conclusion most of this I would

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,990
say there some diversity but I would say

00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:26,700
there very few of us who see survivalism

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:31,029
per se as as an adequate response

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:36,190
regardless of the enormity of the of the

00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:39,179
challenge you know as a previous speaker

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:42,730
said you know collapse is a normal thing

00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:45,850
it's normal in human lives it's normal

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,490
in history so we should we should try to

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,669
understand the dynamics of collapse and

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:54,820
what it's likely to lead to collapse is

00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:58,480
a process by which societies become more

00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:01,659
simplified having built up unsustainable

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,299
levels of complexity they simplify

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:07,480
themselves so that right there tells you

00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:10,240
a lot about what the future the collapse

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:15,250
collapse future if you will is likely to

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:22,960
look look like simpler slower more

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:26,820
communitarian less mediated by things

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:31,000
like automobiles and electronic machines

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,860
now that may sound kind of scary but you

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,649
know that also sounds a lot like how

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:39,789
most of human beings throughout most of

00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:41,590
history have lived right so if if you

00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:43,799
want to prepare for the future I would

00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:48,840
suggest doing things like learning

00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:51,940
practical skills and building community

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,159
learning how to share things because if

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,970
the financial economy is one of the

00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:00,850
things that may collapse first in this

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:03,460
in this whole process that it is

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:07,110
unlikely to occur overnight but more

00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:11,409
likely to occur over a period of decades

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:15,400
then then yet learning how to get by

00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:17,500
without money makes a lot of sense

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,960
right learning how learning how to share

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,480
learning how to build community learning

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,440
how to do things for ourselves and for

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,960
each other now there are those who are

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,780
suggesting that in fact in many ways in

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,059
many ways life could be better if we do

00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,700
these things because we become so

00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:40,630
alienated from one another with you know

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:45,400
the financial system and technology that

00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:46,270
we've actually had to sacrifice a lot of

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,000
our humaneness

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:52,300
in the process of building up all of

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,120
this societal complexity okay so there

00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:58,059
may be be some opportunities here those

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,880
need to be explored and mapped and there

00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:02,860
are folks doing that for example in the

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,720
transition movement there are transition

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,940
towns hundreds and thousands of them

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,160
that have sprung up all around the world

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,130
with the basic premise that life can be

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,740
better without fossil fuels we just have

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:18,280
to come together in community and find

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:21,490
out how so it's not all doom and gloom

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:25,030
but this is reality this is the time

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:28,630
we're living in it's not something again

00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,280
that's likely to happen overnight it's

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,760
going to happen over a period of decades

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:39,280
but that doesn't mean it's not happening

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:41,050
and so it's been a privilege and a

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,600
pleasure to share these thoughts with

00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:46,720
you and hopefully this is a conversation

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:50,470
that you will find yourself engaging in

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,990
in with your friends and family because

00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,570
the more of us who understand that this

00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:58,360
is the process that that our world is

00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:00,940
going through the less likely we are to

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,920
just blame other people when things

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,590
aren't working out the way we expect

00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,280
there's going to be a lot of blame to go

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,130
around

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:12,370
for why you know society is coming apart

00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,440
in various ways but blaming is not going

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,500
to get us anywhere

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,450
building community will so maybe that's

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,510
the right note to end on thank you

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,510
you

00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,210
