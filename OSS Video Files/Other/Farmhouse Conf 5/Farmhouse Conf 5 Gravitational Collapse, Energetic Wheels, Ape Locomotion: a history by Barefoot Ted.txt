Description: 
	A quick look at strategies used by the genus Homo to enhance and extend the joy of mobility past and present. Starting with the evolution of bipedalism and the radical growth of the brain, I will catalog what I see as the most important behaviors, capacities and inventions that propelled humans into the now..., and I will demonstrate where I think we are going next.

ok so my my anecdote to introduce our

00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:17,660
final story teller barefoot ted goes

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:20,270
like this this here is bukas bukas and

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,520
his older brother scott and couple other

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,860
kids from Salt Lake all went to a zine

00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:31,550
symposium in Portland in 2003 and I was

00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:34,160
living with a guy who made a zine about

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,629
sort of traveling and stuff at the time

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,429
and I was doing I was tryin to make a

00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,870
website version of a zine distro where

00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:40,640
you download PDFs instead of mail

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,260
ordering you know pieces of paper like

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,969
idiots so we went to the zine symposium

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,370
and was just full of what people would

00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,350
now call hipsters we didn't quite call

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,089
each other that then but people who

00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,879
collect like antique typewriters right

00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:58,609
in like hand stitch they like binding in

00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,739
their threads are in their jeans it was

00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:03,350
it was not the zine set that I had grown

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,390
up with of like this sort of like punk

00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,430
rock photocopy you know we make these

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,100
scenes as a way to communicate across

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,210
like scenes and like time zones and

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,120
state lines because we didn't have

00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,430
myspace and facebook and blogs and web

00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,500
really I mean we barely had like AOL or

00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,420
whatever so we made these scenes out of

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,770
a sort of like pragmatism and then that

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,950
pragmatism was sort of stripped away by

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:28,880
the web rightly so so now that the sort

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,970
of zine culture is more for like the

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,170
aesthetic of it or for the like the

00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:36,350
Kitsch is too strong but you know like

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:39,010
the sort of as a craft yeah you know

00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,950
more like the etsy set and less like the

00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:45,950
like the mohawk set so we're at this

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,660
thing I meet bukas and his brother Scott

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,760
and our friend Gary because they were

00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,070
the only other like punk looking kids

00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,080
and I was like oh my gosh and they like

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,770
some of them turn out to also be vegan

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,750
straight edge or some combination and

00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,670
they were the first people to say oh my

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,410
gosh you live in place X I've always

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,050
wanted to go to place x which in this

00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,160
case with santa cruz and and then scott

00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,899
actually showed up like a month later

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,099
that never happened to me before like I

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,840
always traveled my friends they don't

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,549
really come to me and like they showed

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,780
up I was like awesome and then I ended

00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,819
up kind of like fall in love with these

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,549
like batch of kids that live

00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:21,590
this squat house in salt lake city and

00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:24,139
then of a later moved there and then

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:30,680
later we all move up to Seattle I'm gone

00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:33,620
a long way for this one and yes but it

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,049
doesn't end in a pond unfortunately and

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,939
you know like all things sort of houses

00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:41,120
you know things fall apart we go our

00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:45,500
separate ways and one day Scott bukas

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,749
and Scott are in ravenna Park volunteer

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,109
park slacklining between a couple trees

00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:52,489
and this guy was there too and they get

00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:54,799
talking to each other because you all

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,540
had read born to run so they had read

00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,519
the book born to run they're like hey

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,469
are you barefoot ted we just read the

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,139
book with like slacklining let's be

00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:10,159
of the story to tell that i won't tell

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,109
his side and then so you know this book

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,969
was sort of introduced to me years ago

00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,370
you should read this which i think

00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:17,419
everyone should read it's real great

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,949
even if you don't fancy yourself a

00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,969
runner don't want to become runner it's

00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:24,560
just that's really like kind of

00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:26,569
fascinating story and years later I end

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,519
up at the square office like square calm

00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:30,349
little swipey thing and they had on

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,639
their like stack of free books everyone

00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:33,139
should take one of these born to run so

00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,720
I finally picked one up like two years

00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:38,359
ago and then finally just a few months

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,150
ago at Bernie man i took my stack of

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,199
like you know bound printed matter and I

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,780
was like this is gonna be my apply a

00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,030
project i want to read books and I read

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,409
Born to Run like like 36 hours I

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,939
couldn't put it down and I woke up one

00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:55,120
morning I was like I'm going to go for a

00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:59,900
run I have burning man and which is the

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,299
hottest windiest dustiest run you'll

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,819
ever do maybe not hottest but it's up

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:06,409
there but it's also the flattest right

00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:09,109
like I just ran in this big circle and

00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:10,340
like I kids deceiving how far you're

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:14,299
actually running when you could see all

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,699
the Train and turns out there was a 50k

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,500
happy to you and I did not run a 50k but

00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:20,000
I was on like my first lap or what would

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,070
have been my first lap if I did more

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,900
than one when everyone was on their last

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,580
lap of this like seven mile loop and

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,530
they were like you look good buddy I was

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,000
like thanks and then like at

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,980
after i saw you know like the first guy

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,390
in like purple spandex pants and no

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,920
shirt with like a number there i thought

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,680
oh that's it's like burning man costume

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,390
he's like marathon or guy and then and

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,180
then I see another one and I'm like

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,710
that's maybe a group a camp there's like

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,630
the marathoners camp and I see a bunch

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,920
and we passed this like thing that's

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,940
clear like the start/finish line I was

00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,770
like is there something happening there

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,050
like 50k that's when people start giving

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,600
compliments I was like I'll take it so I

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,960
ended up I ended up running a little

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,840
seven mile loop which was the longest

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,430
run i had done largely because I you

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,080
know woke up pumped from this book going

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,510
to run and that sort of brings it all

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,890
back around barefoot ted is one of the

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,680
characters in that book and that book

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,290
sort of collects characters and I

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,960
actually started trying to get Ted at

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,480
this since the first one and our

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,860
schedules just kept not aligning I'm so

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:28,050
happy he can make it for the final talk

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:30,960
at the final cut off barefoot ted thank

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,480
you yeah that story actually there's an

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,300
it's connected to I've got a bizarre I

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,700
had a lot of fun making you know Shane

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,830
wanted collapse in the title so i was

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,120
like collapse whoa what the hell am I

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:47,070
gonna say about that and then I was like

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:49,440
oh yeah collapse ok so my title is kind

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,440
of bizarre and but I will enjoy trying

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,060
to explain what it means and the title

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:59,670
of my talk is gravitational collapse

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:03,950
energetic wheels ape locomotion a

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:06,270
history and I know that's crazy and

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,880
believe me I take great pleasure in

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,280
telling you that I know that's crazy but

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,020
I want to read a little bit more about

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,120
about it and then I'm going to fill in

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,130
all the gaps how's that sound so then i

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,950
say i want it i'm going to take a quick

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,410
look at strategies used by the genus

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,050
Homo to enhance and extend the joy of

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,970
mobility past and present starting with

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,130
the evolution of bipedalism and the

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,350
radical growth of the brain I will

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,080
catalog what I see as the most important

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,510
behaviors capacities and inventions that

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,400
propelled humans into the now and I will

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,350
demonstrate where I think we are going

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,600
next

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,280
I had so much fun writing I was like oh

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,180
my god what the hell are you gonna think

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,790
about that I'll get to it I'll get

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,070
to it but I want to get back to several

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,690
things um number one the book born to

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,910
run I don't know has anybody read that

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,800
book anybody here so there's a few their

00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,960
port in Chapter for those you haven't

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,880
read it go to chapter 25 verse 1 that's

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,090
the way I like to say it the sentence is

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,680
the following one of the finest

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,470
sentences in American literature I think

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:16,310
it goes like this barefoot ted was right

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:22,040
of course okay so that basically sums it

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:24,250
up now it turns out i grew up spending a

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,200
lot of time under avocado trees and and

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,790
avocado trees have a really big part of

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,890
my life actually so it's kind of cool to

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,380
be sitting here above my kitchen is an

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,630
avocado leaf from the tree that my was

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,400
growing in my grandmother's garden which

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,310
isn't very more than 20 miles away from

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,380
here and she had one tree that fruited

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,360
in late summer and one tree that fruited

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,130
in the fall and I ate avocados all my

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,200
life all the time and I had no idea that

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,150
they were expensive or valuable I just

00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,250
loved them along with pomegranates and

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,870
figs and and all the other good stuff

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,880
that you can grow and believe me i just

00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,130
spent six months in turkey this year and

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,050
i found out where the holy land is for

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,000
all this stuff and let me tell you well

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,060
avocados not that that's not one of them

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,440
do you know Nava cotton out all is

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,780
testicles anyway how did I get there I

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,220
don't know back to the gravitational

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,630
stuff so bukas and and his brother are

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,340
slacklining in the park I come running

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,920
around the corner with my two siberian

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,230
huskies at speed barefooted on wet grass

00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,180
and come to a screeching halt and this

00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,280
guy goes we know who you are something

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,260
like that I'm Who am I there barefoot

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,360
ted and I'm like oh cool and I was like

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,680
oh I want to slackline to you in anyway

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,180
long story short they taught me out a

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,120
slackline and I was like oh these guys

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,340
are cool and it turns out that i had

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,919
already met bukas about a year before

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,080
that and it's kind of connected to my

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,780
whole entire history of playing around

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,940
with movement and mobility I met bukas

00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,980
riding my high-wheel bicycle through

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,860
volunteer park I have one of those you

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,460
know 1890 is the last year of them you

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,440
know though aunt

00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,750
bicycles those things are awesome I

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,920
really love them and the reason i love

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,380
them is because they're one of the few

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,360
form vehicles human-powered vehicles

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,430
that allow you to keep moving like a

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,720
human being human beings are upright

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,040
creatures you might have noticed that

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,900
you know this is like a much more

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,910
appropriate position to be standing then

00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,830
sort of like this right this is kind of

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,110
weird the only other animal that I know

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,740
that moves while it's sitting is a dog

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,690
with a scratchy but so you know I don't

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,230
know what it's it's like we've we've

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,130
sort of got ourselves used to sort of

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,780
contorting ourselves to fit the

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,340
equipment because the efficiency comes

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,530
from contorting ourselves to the

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,450
equipment IE the very basic what's

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,610
called a safety bicycle as opposed to an

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,460
ordinary bicycle high wheel bicycles

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,990
were known as Ordinaries safety bicycles

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,940
were known as safeties and they weren't

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,000
any good until that pneumatic tire was

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,010
developed in 1889 and by 1890 the whole

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,440
world changed and a lot of great things

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,900
happen I mean you can say some feminists

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,130
will write that a lot of women's started

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,450
being able to wear pants and ride

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,670
bicycles and they had freedom and all

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,130
that but that pneumatic tire screwed up

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,530
this history of machines that allowed

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,450
you to be like this up above your work

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,040
and when you're riding a high wheel

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,170
bicycle it feels as if you're just

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,330
willing yourself through space it's kind

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,180
of similar to walking and the problem is

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:13,130
as joyful and as wonderful as awesome as

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,660
is right I will bicycle they're not very

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,480
practical they're not very safe in a

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,250
less than 0 point 0 0 1 percent of the

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,130
world's population is ever going to ride

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,840
one so there you have it I met him I was

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,700
riding through this park and nobody else

00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,350
was like really like they're kind of

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,180
like Seattle people don't want to like

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,590
pay attention like if something's new or

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,710
that they just kind of doesn't exist

00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,330
aren't scary yeah and he was like hey

00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,040
you know they kind of you know we had a

00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,280
conversation year later I'm stopping

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,620
their our relationship begins I'm trying

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,230
to start a sandal company because i had

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,000
spent a lot of times investigating

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,220
another form of mobility and that is

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,050
running i was having a great difficulty

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,390
trying to crack the nut of running i

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,070
decided before my 40th birthday i was

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:58,160
going to try to run a marathon because I

00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,780
see a california senator Sun and and

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,250
there was a guy named Alan Cranston his

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,200
son ran a marathon when he was four

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,730
years old and he had a party at the

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,230
Santa Monica Pier carousel that my

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,300
family was operating at that

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,950
time and I thought holy crap a 40 year

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,600
old man can run a marathon my god I'm

00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,400
gonna shoot for that when i get up in

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,010
those age you know that that high age

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,480
bracket and that date was coming and i

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,190
started investigating running and i

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,410
found it to be a brutally hard and

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,610
impossible thing to do and I really

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,740
thought that the only way it was

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,050
possible is that you either had to take

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,060
painkillers or be insane or really have

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,790
to find some really cool technology and

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,140
I decided that the technology part was

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,360
going to be the solution so I started

00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,700
doing a lot of investigating and I found

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,530
some incredibly bitchin shoes from

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,930
Switzerland called kengo jumps I mean

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,820
they were awesome leaf springs are built

00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,740
into the boot and you I basically they'd

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,960
come out with a new one and i was i was

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,430
googling and eyeballing those things

00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,690
that i was going oh my god i'm going to

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,190
be one of the first to get these things

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:56,840
and i'm going to tigger myself into

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:58,550
history so with regular running shoes I

00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,750
was getting to about an hour I could run

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,880
for about an hour and then it was just

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,260
like it was didn't it wasn't that I

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,820
didn't have any more juice as you can

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,890
see I got some juice but I was like in

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,810
pain and I like going what the hell am I

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,850
going to do so I had the solution i was

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,410
i bought this is expensive i didn't

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,090
really have a very much money was

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,090
waiting waiting for they come they came

00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,680
i figured instead of one hour i figure

00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,720
on the first day with these things since

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,370
they were they were really hyping them

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,770
they were like I forget how many times

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,910
more impact they were going to resist

00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,680
and you were going to be able to go this

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,200
that and and I was thinking two hours

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,240
out of the box well I put him on in like

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,770
15 minutes later I was basically feeling

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,050
same kind of pain as I was getting when

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,090
I was you know running for one hour in

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,370
my better running shoes so I was like

00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,280
whoa crap i turned the dial to 11 and

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,770
here i am still nothing not no good so i

00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,060
had to really reconsider what the hell i

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,470
was going to do because i was really

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,200
committed to trying to learn how to run

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,330
so i started investigating it and it

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,370
just so happens that there were people

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,160
back in that time that we're suggesting

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:01,040
that the possibility is that human

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,510
beings had evolved to become like like

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,790
they were the consider to be the

00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,550
preeminent endurance animal on the

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,440
planet and if you added heat distance

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,180
and speed you would could you would end

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,860
up having humans ride to the topic we're

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,930
not the fastest we're like really

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,550
incredibly slow i mean a squirrel will

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,590
beat some of the fastest human beings

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,690
but when you add time and heat

00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,490
because we can sweat and you add our

00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,990
brain to the whole package and you have

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,180
somebody following something like in

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,860
tracking an animal well suddenly humans

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,650
like rise way to the top and there's

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,050
these people many people in in the past

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,000
it and even to this day people in South

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,340
Africa the song people still do it

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,960
what's called persistence hunting and a

00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,090
friend of mine now dr. Lieberman who

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,380
wears our sandals which is I kind of not

00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,860
getting into the story correctly but

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,110
nonetheless he writes about how human

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,890
beings are these you know our preeminent

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,870
as a running species we are by virtue of

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,510
being able to both number one read

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,100
tracks figure out what those mean start

00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,480
following something and two to five

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,730
hours later we actually could

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,950
conceivably without even having invented

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,920
a weapon have something to eat that was

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,030
kind of a kind of a model of

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,070
evolutionary biologists are talking

00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,560
about for human beings now okay well

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,110
anyway I think okay cool barefoot

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,050
barefoot might work now growing up here

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,850
in Southern California my brand of

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,130
clothing that i wore and the kind of

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,470
culture that i was born into was surf

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,330
and skate culture I was part of you know

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,180
if you've seen the movie dog town you

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,430
basically see my life unfold before you

00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,290
accept I was in the suburbs and they

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,020
were on the you know well they were in

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:39,200
the low end beach and that during that

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,030
period hang ten was like my you know my

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,130
clothing had to have hang I had to have

00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,300
to friggin feet on my closer I wasn't

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,240
going to be cool and I wasn't going to

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,950
be happy and at the surfing culture at

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,870
that time really surfers don't count

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,330
anything skateboarders it's all about

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,270
experience it's all about being out

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:58,670
there and and it's very basic equipment

00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,620
and it just takes the skill that you you

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,060
you develop and you end up doing these

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,000
incredible things and you share these

00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,890
incredible experiences and I'm before

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,360
the urethane wheel when we were

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,860
skateboarding most skateboarders went

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,200
barefoot it wasn't unusual there's a

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,790
great moving from 1964 called skater

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,560
data I recommend you check out on

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,060
youtube and you'll see dudes like

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,650
skateboarding they've got like all these

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,330
club uniforms on and they've they're

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,160
like kind of an upper-class palace

00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,840
varese every one of them skateboarding

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,970
barefoot because barefoot was best

00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,980
everybody knew that then your thing will

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,480
came in all holy crap everything changed

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,459
and then Van Doren's which was a

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,290
California company and one of the

00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,670
early ones was in my neighborhood we had

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,589
to start wearing shoes because we were

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,660
going too fast and it wasn't cool

00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:41,899
anymore to like you know wipe out when

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,360
your feet were getting torn up so long

00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,579
story short barefooting was part of my

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,189
life as a Southern California person it

00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:51,319
and basic shoes were normal to me and I

00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:52,910
never had any of the fancy running shoes

00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:56,149
that ended up becoming what everybody

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,429
was wearing in the 1990s and then up

00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,920
until when I started wanting to run so I

00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:02,929
got kind of curious about these people

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,040
and evolutionary biologists and other

00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,600
saying that human beings were these

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,689
great runners what was obvious that they

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,819
weren't running with anything fancy and

00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:13,220
so I was wondering about that and I

00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:15,050
ended up stumbling on a website where

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,269
this guy was riding and had been running

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,759
barefoot and I was like whoa is this

00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:21,499
really possible and I read everything on

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,480
his website spent like three days

00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:25,699
studying all these links that he had and

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,379
all these studies and all of this stuff

00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:29,869
and if you were willing to put the time

00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:30,709
in back in 2003 when I was doing this

00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:34,040
you would have come to the conclusion

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:36,230
that it might be possible to actually

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,720
learn how to run well and actually

00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,059
better without any shoes on then with

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,699
shoes and I was like it is this really

00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:47,629
possible well it ended up becoming

00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:49,579
possible and for me I really like the

00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:51,740
first day I started running barefoot it

00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:55,069
was like oh my god it was like I'd

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,869
finally like realized when you learn how

00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:59,299
to master this kind of movement pattern

00:16:56,869 --> 00:17:01,490
that's really old I mean human beings

00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:03,740
have been moving in this way for

00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,929
tremendously long periods of time you

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,449
know way more than historical time and

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:11,120
if you get tuned into the way that

00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:13,250
movement pattern feels like if you had

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,709
not experienced it before it like

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,779
suddenly feels like it's like it's like

00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,370
if you somebody how somehow mistakenly

00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,649
learned how to jump rope landing on your

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,899
heels you know it would be really kind

00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:25,789
of ridiculous if you were doing that and

00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:28,459
particularly like with the slow cadence

00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:30,080
but once you start like learning how to

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:31,640
jump rope and you like bland more on

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,860
your forefoot and you sort of get into a

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,260
rhythm and you start feeling this kind

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,210
of sense of exhilaration of like energy

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,000
storing and recoiling in your body if

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,409
you start tasting that and playing

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,710
around with it it ends up being

00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:47,710
something that comes very natural to

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,649
while human beings and I got playing

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,799
around with that and it led to all kinds

00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:55,690
of fascinating adventures for me which

00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,640
went from like wanting to run a marathon

00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,320
which I ended up being able to run a

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,600
marathon barefooted which was really

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,460
weird and at the time everybody was

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,890
telling me that can't be done and well

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,539
it of course I was doing it and at the

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,730
time I was just really trying to be

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:12,159
somebody who could find a way to enjoy

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,779
sort of biohacking and in the end that's

00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:16,570
what it really came down to it was like

00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:19,720
being a human being is really about

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,309
being able to be a self of self

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,740
experiment of one and playing around

00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:26,890
with what you have and seeing how it can

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:30,640
work out well it worked out well for me

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:32,590
and at that time I started thinking well

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,870
human beings obviously worth footwear

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,390
now what what was so wrong about

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,760
Footwear as it existed at the time that

00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,340
when I was starting to run and it came

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,590
down to the idea that most footwear was

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,679
assuming that human beings are like born

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:51,039
broken like somehow the foot is in and

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,750
of itself some kind of problematical

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,309
feature on the human being and that if

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,990
you could basically chop that off at

00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:58,750
birth and put some kind of rubber stump

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,279
there you'd be better off but if you

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,230
can't do that then at least you could

00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,450
sort of like tether it and keep you know

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,130
support its arch and squeeze its toes in

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,490
and give it so well it turns out the

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:11,230
more many of those kind of koalas or

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,049
junk science and mass marketing

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,880
solutions ended up being kind of common

00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,340
sensical to everybody so that

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,200
barefooting seemed extraordinarily

00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,419
subversive now I don't know many of you

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,000
have paid attention to it but there's

00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:27,610
been a radical seat shift in the way

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,010
that people look at an approach running

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:35,470
and it's like bless has become more and

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:37,390
being part of that process has Billy

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,940
really interesting to be able to have

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:42,460
done and one of those things has been my

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,110
own personal investigations in what has

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,049
been the natural selection of footwear

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,990
in human societies over time and as i

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,760
did that i found that simple sandals

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,130
were being still being worn and been

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,529
used for long periods of time by people

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,950
all through all over the world and at in

00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,720
modern times

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,580
there were three groups of people that

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,169
were still using either barefoot or

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,210
simple sandals to do what we would

00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,460
consider extraordinary things on their

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,929
own two feet one were the song people

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,429
that I mentioned before the other were

00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,950
these people called the Mount marathon

00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:15,500
monks of Hijaz on these Japanese monks

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,480
that run approximately 50 kilometres a

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,029
day for a hundred days in a row wearing

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,529
a 3-ounce rice straw sandal and the

00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:23,809
third group with these guys called

00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:25,309
powder amata or the rah-rah moody as

00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,049
they call themselves who are these

00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,809
incredible long-distance runners who

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:31,669
live in Chihuahua Mexico well that was

00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,440
pretty close to Iowa Mexico sorry I

00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:35,630
started googling and I found that there

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,220
was a guy who had gone down there and

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,539
started living with these people and had

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,970
been running with them and he had

00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:42,860
created a race and was trying to get

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,019
people to come down and be part of this

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,480
50 mile raced to come and run with these

00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:49,340
Indians and I was thinking whoa that

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,080
sounds pretty good i think i'd like to

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,029
give that a try and i was very

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,260
interested in checking out their sandals

00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:57,019
and like playing around with this

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,299
ancient technology and that's it it sort

00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,940
of comes down to some of these solutions

00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:04,460
these very basic mobility solutions have

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,529
been solved very well and used for long

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,059
periods of time and it turns out this

00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:11,179
sandal that these people were wearing

00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,830
was something that I was really itching

00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:15,110
to give a try I tried some of those

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,700
sandals that does Mount marathon monks

00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,590
were wearing there were like rice straw

00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,870
sandals like I said wearing three ounces

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,340
the problem is they make about a hundred

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,409
per year and they make them themselves

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,389
out of rice straw well you know I'm not

00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:28,250
going to be a hundred pair of your

00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:29,929
weaving rice straw doesn't sound like

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:33,289
it's going to be the most economical way

00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:35,809
to you know proceed where's the tot

00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:37,190
amato we're using car tires and wrapping

00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,980
them on with leather I thought that was

00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,139
probably a better better gig well I went

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,049
down there and I did learn how to wear

00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:48,110
those sandals and I was totally blown

00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:51,139
away at how both simple they were and

00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:53,299
yet effective and so when I ran into

00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:54,980
these brothers running that day I had

00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:56,779
been spending about a year trying to

00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,539
figure out how to go down to Mexico to

00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:01,700
start up a company that would be reef

00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:03,740
creating these sandals for you know

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,720
people like us so that we could you know

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,539
most people are going to go out and cut

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,179
a tire and and uh make a pair of sandals

00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:11,870
well these brothers had done that when I

00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,540
showed up

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,190
day the his brother was wearing a pair

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,900
of sandals that he had actually made out

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,610
of you know that's how that's what kind

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,440
of guys these are they had actually made

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,020
their sandals out of tires you know big

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,820
heavy pieces of rubber well I knew what

00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:29,240
I knew I had some interesting people

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:32,000
when I saw that so we I was at the time

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,590
in my garage making these sandals and I

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,390
was like trying to figure out how I

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,130
wasn't even telling anybody was making

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,350
any more that the book Born to Run

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,050
hadn't even come out yet or had it oh

00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,580
yeah that's right of course and people

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,140
were that after before the book had come

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,960
out I was like selling them and it was

00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,940
kind of cool maybe 10 para week 20 para

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,470
week whatever after that book came out

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,300
it was like there was a lot of people

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,070
trying to order them and I was like no

00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,750
longer interested in trying to like keep

00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:59,059
up with the demand and I couldn't

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,620
imagine how anybody would want to like

00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:02,420
help me make sandals I don't know why

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,090
but I was just like thinking that that

00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,760
was not possible anyway the beautiful

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,590
thing about this in the end is that

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:13,280
organically we all sort of like it's

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:16,490
like my company was a one-man show and

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,010
then it slowly started growing and it

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,200
turns out that all of these kind of

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,990
connections were just it just happened

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,240
like through relationships in a weird

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,760
way it was just like people that were

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,290
like within my space it turns out many

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,240
of the people ended up who end up

00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:35,000
working for the company Luna sandals are

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,059
people I met for the first time in

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,630
volunteer park and that really was

00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:45,410
blowing my mind anyway so here I am now

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:47,240
it's been 2006 was when the book born to

00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,130
run the story the book Born to Run is

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,750
talking about happened and now we have

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,150
this sandal company that we're selling

00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,860
sandals all over the world and people

00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,920
are running in them and doing their

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:00,800
lives in them and whatever and I got

00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,320
very intrigued again earlier this year

00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,780
our late last year about trying to

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,840
imagine i'd always been imagining

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,370
growing up in the skateboard world and

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,990
five years ago six years ago I set the

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,030
world record for distance covered on a

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,429
skateboard in 24 hours I was just always

00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,260
very very much intrigued about finding

00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:20,300
some kind of solution some kind of

00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,120
machine that was going to allow us to

00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,670
you know ride like a like upright and

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,710
have fun doing it and do it safely

00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,960
and it turns out I found some kind of

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,580
machine like that so here's here's

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,310
running here's the basic concept of

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,410
running running is you stand up to all

00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:38,720
your head balance on your shoulders your

00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:41,690
core slightly engaged and you slightly

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,990
sleen at the lean at the ankles and you

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,610
actually start to collapse your gravity

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,380
actually some riders call it that

00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,480
there's there's some people who write

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,150
about running and you as a human being

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,830
you buy in this position start to lean

00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,500
and at some point you're going to fall

00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:59,780
and then what you do is you begin to

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:03,050
turn your feet over in a certain pattern

00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:05,990
and that pattern is sort of like if you

00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:08,240
look at it when the impact charts of

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:10,520
running it's almost like a smooth wheel

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,010
when you're running really well it's

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,560
almost like this really smooth energetic

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:18,890
wheel you're creating and when you ride

00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:21,710
that wheel well it really feels good and

00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,930
actually before a talk I did in before

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,150
that at the New York Marathon couple

00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,520
years ago dr. Lieberman from Harvard

00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,040
University said hey you need to google

00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,590
this word endocannabinoid has anybody

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,200
heard the word endocannabinoid there's a

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,240
few of you it's really trippy so he says

00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,610
might might want my one of my colleagues

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,690
is studying on the runner's high and

00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,760
everybody's heard of the runner's high

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:49,190
right everybody assumes it's like an

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:51,110
endo ra endorphin experience and he said

00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,440
my colleagues thinking no this is not

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,090
the case it turns out that the endorphin

00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,040
molecule to get to the place where this

00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,810
euphoria is happening is a little bit

00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,640
too big it doesn't seem and he's got

00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,010
another theory about what it might be

00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,010
well the theory turns out to be now

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,440
science fact and what it is is when you

00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,110
move well when you when you're moving

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,700
smoothly and I this kind of creation of

00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,560
this energetic wheel when you're running

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,480
really well is kind of the smoothness

00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,580
that I'm talking about you can get it

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,920
through dance too and some other smooth

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,110
and human scale movements not too fast

00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,560
so that starts getting adrenaline driven

00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:29,800
but it turns out unbelievably the

00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,150
euphoria you're experiencing is an

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,730
endogenously created cannabinoid

00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,310
experience in other words if you were to

00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,990
take a nice big puff of ganja right now

00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,610
you'd have a can

00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,160
ab annoyed experience in this case it

00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,780
would be an ex-jock exogenous

00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,280
cannabinoid experience but the reason

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,559
you would even be able to have that is

00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,750
because human beings along with some

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,940
other long distance running animals as

00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:55,610
opposed to animals that don't run long

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,620
distance are actually rewarded uniquely

00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,590
for moving well over a long period of

00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:03,650
time and that unique reward is a feeling

00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:06,260
of oneness connectedness of being

00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:08,900
exhilarated of being happy that is

00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,280
endocannabinoids at work did you know

00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:15,350
that well that's what I'm here to tell

00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:17,450
you skateboarding I believe is an

00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:19,429
endocannabinoid experience surfing I

00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,350
believe is an endocannabinoid experience

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,770
a lot of these exhilaration sports are

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:26,450
endocannabinoid experiences I've always

00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,550
thought you know one thing that's always

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,640
depressed me is the commute

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:34,820
people do in cities I divorced myself

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:39,380
from that man badass terrible

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:41,300
I mean seriously and you know the

00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,490
bicycles awesome but you know talking

00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,260
about there's some things about it that

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,270
I don't like and so it's not very

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,370
comfortable it's not very safe sometimes

00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,920
so I've been always dreaming I've been

00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:54,620
always imagining how in the hell could

00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,720
we come up with a way that would be your

00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,790
commute would be exhilarating

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,429
you'd get to work like feeling high

00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:04,100
you'd be ready you'd be like totally

00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:06,190
like stoked and furthermore and this is

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,660
where it gets tricky to me you know

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,640
bicycles are awesome no doubt about it

00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,160
and they're the most efficient human

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,620
powered vehicle that's ever been created

00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,809
this is a fact it's it's more efficient

00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,300
than walking or running for sure the

00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:22,580
problem is this is what really blows my

00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,800
mind do you know you know Michael Pollan

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,950
pointed this out recently the average

00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,650
American diet for every one kilogram or

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,900
one gram of caloric energy there are 10

00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,400
grams of friggin fossil fuels involved

00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,320
in the creation of that one gram of

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,780
cattle orac-energy for the average

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,390
American diet right that's trippy we're

00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:43,460
 petroleum eaters that means that

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,200
you know even when you're riding your

00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,580
bike you're burning some petroleum well

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,160
anyway don't get depressed you can ride

00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,260
your bike ok

00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:54,010
but it turns out I found something

00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:57,370
better I found something better and it

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:59,500
turns out sometimes you find what you're

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,410
looking for and I want to encourage you

00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,480
to do two things there's this dude I

00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:07,150
really like called Howard Thurman he was

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,060
Martin Luther King's mentor anybody

00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,590
heard of Howard Thurman yeah cool well

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,290
Howard Thurman has this one little

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:17,310
phrase that I like he it goes like this

00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:21,840
it says don't ask what the world needs

00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:25,030
instead ask what makes you come alive

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,740
because what the world needs are people

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,660
who have come alive right you know and

00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:32,920
I'm like oh dude I like that man because

00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:36,340
I like being alive right and I like

00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:38,890
people being alive because I think that

00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,390
when you're alive problems are like

00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,240
opportunities I mean you know that's

00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:45,550
very cliche but it's true and if you

00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,410
start getting inspired and start feeling

00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,900
like you want to do something and you

00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,910
start looking for it and these days men

00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,190
we have the tools like no other time to

00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,170
start looking for things finding our

00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,940
community finding the things that

00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,280
intrigued us finding the things that are

00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,140
going to solve the problem we have it

00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,640
more than ever I mean it's like a dream

00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:08,050
of mine to live like we're living right

00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:11,290
now I mean seriously so I've been having

00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:12,790
this dream all my life of sort of like

00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,880
how I'm riding the high wheel bicycle

00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:17,500
but wouldn't it be friggin awesome and I

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,330
would do the stand for the last two

00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,910
years or these pictures of me doing like

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,830
this tata-sia kind of stand after races

00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,330
and stuff and what I would be doing I'd

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,190
be standing like this with my hands to

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,600
my side kind of putting my weight into

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,120
my ankles and sort of leaning slightly

00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,520
forward and I was imagining in my mind

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,840
that I was willing myself through space

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,700
sort of like I would do with my

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,620
high-wheel bicycle so when I would be

00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,390
riding that bicycle I'd get into the

00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,180
state were certainly endocannabinoids

00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:46,600
and possibly XO cannabinoids were

00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:49,510
involved where I would be like totally

00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,520
like flying I would be flying in

00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:53,070
complete control and it was like

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,110
tripping me up but so I was like going

00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:58,750
man I want to see I want to live to be

00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:00,340
able to do this like this and I was

00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:03,010
really thinking this okay

00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:06,429
last year how am i doing on time five

00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:08,500
minutes perfect so last year I you know

00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:09,880
because becoming barefoot ted all people

00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,500
all over the world know who i am now and

00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,700
that's really good for our company so

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,200
that we can make sandals and tell

00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,419
stories and that's what our company is

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,919
really about it's a long story and it's

00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,299
connected to all kinds of stories in

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,789
