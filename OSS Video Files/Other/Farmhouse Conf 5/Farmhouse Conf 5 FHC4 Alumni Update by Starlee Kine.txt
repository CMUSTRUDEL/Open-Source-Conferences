00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,950
couple years ago 2007 ok handful of

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,620
years ago now i heard this you know

00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:25,529
episode of this american life that

00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:26,400
Starly was on that it is okay if i ever

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,330
countless are you telling a different

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,810
story okay that it's one of my favorites

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,670
this american lives i just heard the

00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,110
like five millionth episode or whatever

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,790
university they had where they invite

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,219
all their two writers and editors to

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,110
give like it was like a clip show of

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,809
their favorite clips order and this one

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,460
showed up on there or whatever but sorry

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,710
was in a relationship this will be

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,050
interesting to see how much i get right

00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:57,930
and that they had kind of bonded over

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:59,460
this phil collen song called against all

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,300
odds right the postal service later

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,769
covered that and then you know they sort

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,180
of bond over the song it's like you know

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,710
part of their relationship babyish they

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,630
break up and then she found herself

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,400
actually saying those lyrics to him as

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,140
he was like you know breaking up walking

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,450
away and then so i was going through all

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,520
the emotions of break up and decided

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,710
like in order to like exercise these

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,170
demons i want to write a breakup song

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,430
and she goes through all these motions

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,800
of trying to do and eventually finds

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,270
herself talking to Phil Collins on the

00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,990
phone getting advice on how to write a

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,540
great break up song and then also after

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,710
she writes it and gets music made for

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,600
and stuff and sort of puts it together

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,310
like has another phone call with him

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,900
where she like plays it back for him and

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,760
he's like that's pretty good you know

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,900
like I like this line there I never

00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,060
would have thought of it that way or

00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,430
whatever and I was like this is such a

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,130
great you know like I love the small

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,480
world knows of this and that we're all

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,660
pretty interconnected it was just such a

00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:58,230
great story anyhow and then again years

00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,850
later I find myself organizing this

00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:04,530
conference and I was talking with

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:07,140
Heather Peterson who helps with a lot of

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,390
the things she planted the bogan videos

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,510
up there that are those pretty pink

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,310
flowers by the barn and um she was like

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,170
what about Starly kind I was like why do

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,580
I know that name we like sort of like

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,740
rekindled at all I was like

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,080
yes if you can get her somehow that'd be

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:26,960
great and sure enough it's just a matter

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,960
of like asking so Starly kind everybody

00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,610
you got that it was you did good I don't

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,100
think you got anything wrong the lyric

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,340
that I quoted was how can you just walk

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,590
away it was very fitting and then

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,060
somebody wrote me recently who I've not

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,660
written back yet and I feel very bad

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,970
about but I'm bad with facebook message

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,300

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,560
boyfriend she and her boyfriend her

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,880
broken up and when he was breaking up

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,850
with her he found she found herself

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,530
quoting my song to that boyfriend which

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,900
I was which was great and she definitely

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,700

and other kind of other radio stuff

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,690
although not that much other NPR stuff

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,940
because it doesn't it's like different I

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,300
don't know we still really like oil and

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,360
water but um us but I was going to since

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,780
I've been here I was here last May right

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,790
that's when it was so in that time is

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,910
well during that time too i'm actually

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,760
working on a new radio show now and it's

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,800
called mystery show aunt about mysteries

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,510
somebody some girl here in there was

00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,400
saying she was making a pirate video

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,920
game called like pirate game that girl

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,600
are you here anyway anyway i thought it

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,910
was very similar but muscle my show is

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,100
called mr. show it about mysteries and

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,580
in it i'm going to attempt to solve

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,830
people's mysteries cuz i really like the

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,209
mystery genre a lot but i don't i love

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,310
the mystery genre but what I don't like

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,510
about mysteries I try not to use my

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,340
hands too much because I write a comment

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,590
did someone wrote about me they said I

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,360
reminded them of the character and

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,890
Fisher King like the girl did he falls

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,539
for their like if you love that girl

00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,280
you're gonna love watching star Leeteuk

00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,870
and I was just like this is that's a

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,980
very weird comparison

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:39,210
and I got self-conscious um but ripped

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:42,810
this remember that girl Lydia you think

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:45,090
Lydia Lydia um okay so I like the

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,610
mystery genre a lot but what I don't

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,650
like I usually don't like the solutions

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,240
even when they're solved I hate

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,200
mysteries that are not solved my number

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,900
one thing that you not like about

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,430
mysteries that i read about it's like if

00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,830
i read an article that sets up the

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,450
greatest mystery of all time and then

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,950
suddenly they'll just like it but it was

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,110
never solved and that crazy and it

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,180
drives me insane and this happens you

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,570
can if you subscribe to like those kind

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,610
of long read kind of lists I guarantee

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,200
probably once a week there'll be an old

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,910
article that will have that kind of

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,320
setup and it will not have an answer not

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,880
nothing to do with the list that you

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,010
sign up for not their fault but there's

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,410
a lot of this format and it drives me

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,700
crazy and so I don't wanna do that but a

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,710
lot of times the mysteries are solved

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,870
they're all so unsatisfying I find the

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,000
solutions like Sherlock Holmes mysteries

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,010
often have kind of a I like the new

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,740
sherlock show a lot the british one not

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,330
the whatever weird American one but I

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,650
find a lot of the answer kind of

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,200
unsatisfying because they're kind of

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,230
like this forced and wedged in there so

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,940
I want mine to be my show is going to be

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:48,390
where people bring me their mysteries to

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,470
solve and I'm going to try to even if I

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,170
can't solve them i'm going to try to

00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,750
guarantee something satisfying happens

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,340
and so I want this I want the stories to

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,610
kind of lead into each other and it's

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,350
going to have kind of an essay flow and

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,020
the rule of the show is going to be to

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,420
let your curiosity guide you that's what

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,970
I will try to have happen and I'm not

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,140
going to fall back on not knowing the

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,340
answers better than answer because we

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,500
know that's not true and at the cop out

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,610
but it's gonna if there's something that

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,260
happens along the way I will not be like

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,430
so single-minded on just finding the

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,290
number one answer that I won't be able

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,080
to follow it and miss an example of this

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:27,210
was one of the mysteries in the first

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,090
episode I made was I have a friend who

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:35,190
went to go return a she was living in

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:36,450
New York and she rented a video and she

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,160
was kind of like I think she probably

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,720
didn't break up mode and she chose a

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,080
rom-com so she and she remembers very

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,760
clearly that it was a must love dogs

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,940
that was what the movie wasn't as she

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,170
knew

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,060
she wasn't a clear state of mind because

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,970
she rented that and she went to the

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,320
video store on a Saturday and she filled

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,180
out a membership card because she'd

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,920
never been to that store so she had a

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,780
register from membership card signed up

00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,190
rented the movie and the new she

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,620
returned to the next day cuz she's one

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,080
of those people who does that I I don't

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,030
do that but she's one of those which is

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,330
a so she's better than I am is what I'm

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,910
saying anyway so so she returned it to

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,890
she went to go return it the next day on

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,420
Saturday must love dogs and the store

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,740
was completely boarded up and out of

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,510
business and she was really confused

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,060
because they'd let her sign up for

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:24,090
membership card and welcomed her and not

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,040
said you might as well keep this pen in

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,500
this video and like are your money

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,670
because we're never gonna see you again

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,200
and so she was super confusing that

00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,390
happened years ago so she told me to go

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,530
find what happened that store and I did

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,330
end up finding what happened to that

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,800
store like I found the owner I went

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,770
around Tribeca and I went to all these

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,100
places and I asked around that was not a

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,950
buzzer than my out of time okay anyway

00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,450
okay so I went to go find it i found the

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,400
owner and it was fine and but it wasn't

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,560
that exciting the answer but along the

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,260
way I I also found this man who was in a

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,480
bar and hema at a different video store

00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,100
that had burned down and he had his

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,810

favorite movie and he talked about

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,860
fellini's la strada and then he talked

00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,240
about his lost love and how he regretted

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,280
it and it's very touching and then it

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,830
