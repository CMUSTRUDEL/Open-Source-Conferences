first up is Greg Vinick who both both

00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:15,160
Greg and Brian spoke at four bells come

00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:20,590
to the theme there was mapping within

00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:24,519
him not a napping cuff that these two

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:30,460
are going through it's like sleep cuff

00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:34,360
and they're on the nap track so greg was

00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,620
is in a band called trial and trial has

00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,360
this song it's like you know it's like

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,400
their hit song if they were on the radio

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,510
but it's the song that everyone knows

00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,330
and every now and again I find myself in

00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,739
a position talking to someone who

00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,989
doesn't know what I'm dropping like song

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:52,600
lyrics in conversation and I've

00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:54,909
definitely used some trial lyrics more

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,440
than once in conversation specifically

00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:58,210
this one where I sort of ellipsis

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,760
through like eight lines but it's we

00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,589
were born into suffering you know we're

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,210
a bunch of things and we want something

00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:08,020
more and I found myself sort of like

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,430
referring back to that several times

00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,610
that really has nothing to do with his

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,110
talk much I really loved that line it's

00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,700
really important to me advancement

00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,800
important to me and then Greg really

00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,150
swell did we've become you know better

00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,010
friends or the past few years largely

00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:25,380
because of this but he's going to give

00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,380
us an update on his farm scalp to talk

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,500
so I have a few minutes to talk to you

00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,870
about collapse and a few minutes

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,690
therefore to talk to you about process

00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,100
at farmhouse to when we were talking

00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,020
about mapping I stood up and talked

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,850
about 100 for Haiti which was a

00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,290
nonprofit that I had started to do

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,210
development work and post-earthquake

00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,950
Haiti and what we were doing was a

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,270
program called moto logistics and you

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,400
can learn more about it if you watch the

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,100
video of my talk that day but basically

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,020
we were sending money down to Haiti in a

00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,140
microloan program so people could

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,510
initiate their own moto taxi business

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,220
and give themselves jobs because someone

00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,840
had said to me I don't want your money

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,310
this was in Haiti I don't want your

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,049
money I want a way to make money a way

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,660
to survive on my own meaning like

00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:16,810
self-generating so I talked about moto

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,290
logistics and it was going to go great I

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,730
mean we're

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,709
talking about a new roadmap for me was

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,879
going to go amazingly well well tell you

00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,500
a little bit about what happened after

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,019
we started sending money down to

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,819
targeted individuals and organizations

00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:32,709
in Haiti one guy stole our money I know

00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,810
this because people who live near him in

00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:37,540
Haiti said that he bought a new car

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,879
shortly after they knew that I had sent

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,590
money down to Haiti and that's shocking

00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,420
like some haitian guy roaming around a

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,250
nut and a new car where people don't

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,219
have a lot of cars and this guy suddenly

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,840
has a new ish car the only saving grace

00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:51,340
i have in the midst of knowing that i

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,780
sent money that was given in good faith

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,209
down to haiti and that this guy bought

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,950
his car is that I know who he is I know

00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,930
where he lives I have a description of

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,579
the car and one personal motto that I

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,470
always go on in my life and I hope that

00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:04,450
you go on and yours it's very simple it

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:10,000
goes like this it's never too late for

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:12,280
revenge another person we send money

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,269
down to in Haiti got a little bit

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,829
confusing they're like you know we're

00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,450
not sure how to run a moto logistics

00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,280
program even though we were explicit in

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,260
our directions and on how you might do

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,879
this and this person said you know is it

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,040
okay if we send the money back and we

00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,690
said sure so you know two weeks later

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,180
we've got this money back or like well

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,190
that was largely ineffective okay third

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,109
person that we sent the money down to

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,699
and this happens in Haiti the person

00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:36,549
accepted the money started the program

00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:37,930
and then suddenly for no reason died it

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,000
happens I mean it happens to all of us

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,459
and it can happen all this but in Haiti

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,379
people just die and it's partially

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,060
because there's not adequate health care

00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,620
it's partially because Haiti is a petri

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,359
dish of every disease known to humankind

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,699
in every second with everything you

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,729
touch eat drink and see but this person

00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,959
just died talk about collapse I mean

00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:58,180
we're sitting around going okay what are

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,370
we doing with ourselves but in the midst

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,319
of collapse you carry on so I could tell

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,479
you that we also started working with a

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,310
small village and we sent them money

00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,169
down for their motor logistics program

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,239
and it went crazy they started using

00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:12,760
this mototaxi started making money

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,049
wanted money for another mototaxi which

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,609
we sent down they started making money

00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:17,859
with that and started repaying their

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,780
loan to us and it started to transform

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:21,370
their village okay well this is great

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,110
news and I could tell you that we

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,150
started to branch off a little bit we

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,340
found a safe house for former child

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,479
slave boys who had been saved from the

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,789
streets of port-au-prince and

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,249
surrounding areas and we sent them down

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:33,739
money

00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:36,229
just so that they could buy bicycles and

00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:38,989
these former child slaves of varying

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:41,179
ages from age six or so up until age 17

00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:42,979
or so suddenly had bicycles that they

00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:45,709
could ride around and suddenly they were

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:47,689
liberated in two different ways one

00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:50,059
because somebody actually cared about

00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:52,279
them too because they literally had

00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:54,829
their freedom their physical freedom and

00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,959
ability to mobilize and move through

00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:58,879
space and time on their own accord on

00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,319
these bikes and they sent drawings of

00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,269
the bikes and themselves on the bikes

00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,499
and these haphazard little drawings with

00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,869
pen and what not it's really

00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:08,479
heartwarming that's amazing fantastic

00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:11,809
but the question is why in the midst of

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,759
collapse do we continue on not what did

00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:17,269
we do or what did 100 for Haiti or Greg

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,979
do why why do we continue on and I'd

00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:21,169
like to suggest that we continue on in

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:23,689
the midst of collapse because collapse

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:26,209
is an inherent part of process that is

00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:28,339
just as valid as the successes that

00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:31,159
we're always striving for we live in a

00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:33,259
mindset of success where if we fail or

00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:35,089
if we are improper if we are broken or

00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:38,179
damaged we have inherently failed and

00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:40,189
that we are then useless but collapse is

00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:42,139
an inherent part of process and it's

00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:44,149
something to actually celebrate its just

00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:47,329
as valid as the successes we experience

00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:48,949
which is why coming up in January I'm

00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:50,779
going to go back down to Haiti I'm going

00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,610
a few hours north of port-au-prince and

00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:55,309
I'm going to help finish the works

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,929
already been done but our in process is

00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:58,129
being done I'm gonna help finish a

00:05:56,929 --> 00:06:00,409
medical clinic down there that's going

00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:02,269
to be all Haitian run Haitian staff to

00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:05,329
Haitian inspired will put moto logistics

00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:07,399
in there as well okay well there has to

00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:09,139
be a political component to this in my

00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,329
opinion when talking about Haiti because

00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,489
it would be very short-sighted to talk

00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,709
about Haiti and not recognize the fact

00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:17,389
that Haiti and the problems it faces are

00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,849
not the result just of an earthquake but

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,469
of 200 years of oppression and being

00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:23,449
pushed down which are the results of

00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:25,339
global capitalism and greed and the

00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,809
quest for power and if you know anything

00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,159
about Haitian history the fact that

00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:30,829
there was a Haitian slave revolt that

00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:33,739
ended in 1804 which caused haiti to

00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:36,079
exist and generally liberation is bad

00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:37,489
for business which is why people in the

00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,529
united states in terms of government

00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:41,239
officials decided long long ago to start

00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:42,529
suppressing these people keeping them

00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:45,080
marginalized and this is why their

00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,000
country struggles so with that in

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,039
mine it could be seen as we're putting a

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,960
band-aid on a gushing artery in Haiti

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,550
meaning the work that I've done in that

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,800
maybe we should be attacking larger

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,419
structures instead of just helping these

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,000
individuals who just want to make a

00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,039
living on their own well go down to

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,080
Haiti sometime and talk to people about

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,969
the rebel of the revolution and

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,680
rebellion and about global capitalism

00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,180
and about theory and about you know all

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,370
these ideas that are going to overthrow

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,409
the world system all of which are valid

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,789
and well and good but oftentimes in

00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,560
Haiti what I've heard from people is

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,210
okay that's great now what are we going

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,889
to do now what what what's what's

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,569
actually happening love the theory but

00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,000
now what are they hate the theory and

00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:26,060
now what and what what I found is that

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,430
they want the reality the reality of

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,340
what we are going to do not what we

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,139
theorize could be done and I suggest

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,389
that we all want that too meaning we

00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:38,419
want reality in our lives we don't want

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:40,400
just the glossed over beautiful image of

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,960
success we don't want just the the

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,210
highlights of our lives but we actually

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,979
cherish the lows of our lives we cherish

00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,289
the collapse or I hope that we cherish

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,449
the collapse because we need the

00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:52,490
collapse too or else we're just living

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:55,430
at this ridiculous dream world

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,800
constantly and our dreams can deceive us

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,620
and send us off track I mean literally I

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,389
woke up this morning completely confused

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,960
and discombobulated about a dream that I

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:08,000
had last night and this is exactly my

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,610
night into my morning last night I had a

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,279
dream last night that I was standing in

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,589
a desert and I'm looking down at a

00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,960
lizard that has walked slowly up to me

00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:19,490
and then stopped and the lizards there

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,159
and I'm looking at the lizard and the

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,279
lizard looking at me and we are locked

00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:27,139
in eye contact and the reason that I'm

00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,240
locked and I contacted the lizard is

00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:32,180
because the lizard's head is the head of

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,469
my 8th grade science teacher and the

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,500
lizard's looking at me and I'm looking

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:41,089
at the lizard and the lizard says can I

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:43,190
pinch you and I said no and the lizard

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,750
reaches out one of its hands I don't

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,250
want to make a lizard human but whatever

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,130
you call the lizard like appendage that

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,660
is this and or this or whatever lizard

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,209
does but in my dream it went like this

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,560
and pinch the back of my arm and just

00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,029
SAT there with this extended arm

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,970
pinching the back of mine and I said

00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,649
stop it and the lizard did

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,839
and we kept looking at each other and

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,600
then the lizard said can I pinch you and

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,920
I said no and the lizard riches reaches

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,019
out his hand and pinches the back of my

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,970
arm and this went on not about 20 times

00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:13,579
until i was so aggravated with this

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,439
lizard that i woke up at seven o 1am and

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:17,029
now I'm like awake and angry and my day

00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:18,980
is ruined it's like I don't want to come

00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:21,350
here talk to you or anything it's like

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,870
our dreams can ruin us if we latch on to

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,029
our dreams as a reality it's critical

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,310
that we embrace a more full version of

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:31,160
reality in terms of the triumphs as well

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,379
as the collapses I make most of my

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,839
living by training people and how to be

00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:37,850
speakers entrepreneurs and tech people

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,930
too but individuals just people who want

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,819
to learn how to speak more effectively

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,310
come to me I train them and I had a

00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:44,870
client who is a physician who had to

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,879
give a presentation in front of 300

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,800
people and she came to me for some tips

00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,029
and advice on presentation and one of

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,350
the first things I did is I said okay

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,720
well you gonna be in front of 300 people

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,339
unless you've trained as an actress or

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,259
an actor you're going to need to use a

00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,209
microphone and I set up a little PA

00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:00,980
system I put the microphone in her hand

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:04,790
or at least I held out the microphone to

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,230
her and she literally went and backed

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,209
away from this microphone I thought she

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,189
was going to have a nervous breakdown by

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,779
days one two and three were literally

00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:14,779
getting her to hold the microphone and

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:17,360
say hello like it was going to be a long

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,829
process long story short i was in

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,800
finland the summer I was on tour Jonah

00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:23,899
spoken word to her and I get a text on

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,850
my phone and it said did the speech

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,709
standing ovation like she did this

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,360
speech after months of training and got

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,620
a standing ovation I freaked out I ran

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,449
out in the street and I called her I'm

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,889
like whatever this cost it's got to be

00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:35,779
the worst thing in my life next month

00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:37,370
but for right now congratulations you

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:38,899
rule you know and she's like thank you

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,730
so much I'm like great that was 59

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:43,550
seconds plate before we hit a minute you

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,990
know but a point being is that what she

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,269
had done is come into this situation

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,639
with a dream that was going to be

00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:51,980
perfect she was going to try so hard and

00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,110
speak and have it be exactly what she

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,449
wanted with no collapse whatsoever and

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,189
what I told her was if you're afraid

00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:01,850
when you're in front of the audience be

00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:04,160
afraid feel it your hands shaking let it

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,509
shake don't try to stop it because then

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,949
something else is going to start shaking

00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:09,199
and also in the audience like what the

00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:11,630
hell's wrong with this person be afraid

00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:12,830
if you go up on a word or up on a line

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,300
go up on the word

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,070
up on a line if you forget what you're

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,840
saying you forget your name you forget

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,520
why you're there stand in front of the

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,780
audience and embrace the fact that you

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,550
have forgotten your own name and you

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,650
forgotten why you're there and let that

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,530
collapse just be part of the whole

00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,000
experience and that's what I guess led

00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:31,520
her to having the standing ovation

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,610
experience so what I'm here to offer

00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,070
today in this quick review is to embrace

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,870
our collapse embrace our individual

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,940
collapses in terms of our process and in

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,830
terms of our life because the collapses

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,230
that we face and experience are just as

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,670
valid as the triumphs that we are

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,670
striving for thanks everybody

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,120
