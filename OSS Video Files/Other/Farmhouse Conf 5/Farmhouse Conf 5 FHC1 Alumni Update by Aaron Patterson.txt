Aaron Patterson alphabetical yes 2 a's I

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,090
had the good fortune of working with

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,200
Aaron Patterson twice once in Seattle

00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,660
once here in LA with Kobe who here knows

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,640
Aaron Patterson or tender love on the

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:29,189
internets all right we're in good

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,809
company then so I invited him to I want

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,120
to retell one of your jokes he thought

00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:34,559
it was he thought the first one was

00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,710
farmville call so he came here to talk

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,510
about his digital farming that he had

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,970
done and then he was let down and then

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,890
he told embarrassing stories about me so

00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,420
two and a half years later he's going to

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:53,700
tell some more stories for five minutes

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:56,640
and go hello I'm not going to introduce

00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,160
myself Thank You Shane so I'm really

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,600
excited to be here ok I got my notes up

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,780
and make sure I'm within the five

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,309
minutes I'm really excited to be here

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,930
but I haven't heard anything about farm

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,990
houses yet I thought there's a

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,960
conference about farm houses but it is

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,580
not also I didn't know I really didn't

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:28,170
know that a farmhouse comp would be so

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:31,020
intense I was trying to think about puns

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:37,320
about avocados but I thought I should be

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:39,530
more pithy five minutes is this fee

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,340
though

00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:45,960
so I'm happy to be here out like walking

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,500
around in LA and I think it's pretty

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:55,730
awesome i see a lot of signs um that are

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,730
in Spanish like Luud dot and love pd I

00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:06,410
think that's pretty cool uh that's in

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,410
Spanish it means without dot and the PD

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:14,160
so I was at I was at a conference

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,640
cascadia that Shane here helped put on

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,470
few years back and there they served out

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,030
a lot of they had a lot of candy and

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,210
everybody had candy and it was really

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,150
cool except that all the ladles there

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,400
were all right handed ladles so like I'm

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,950
left-handed this that's why I'm using my

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,730
left hand this is this is actually a

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,650
useless appendage chair over here oh so

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,210
the problem is they're all right handed

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,670
ladles they have like a little a little

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,330
spout on the wrong side so if I tried to

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,800
use it it was impossible to use so like

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,170
Shane was super kind he wanted to be

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,180
like very inclusive at the conference so

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,980
he replaced all the ladles with ambi

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,570
ladles and I thought that was really

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,459
awesome i gave a lightning talk about

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,170
ladles at this conference so I was

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:08,570
really happy that he stood up for the

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:11,520
rights of left's every five minutes

00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,660
anyway so also like cachet I noticed

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,250
shane has a company where you're like

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,340
sells t-shirts I guess he's starting

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,410
another company doing book publishing

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,930
and so I just wanted to let you guys

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:26,030
know that now you have a friend of the

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,030
publishing business machine company

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,620
yeah how much time do I have left 22

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:37,370
minutes like two minutes right okay okay

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,450
so I got two more two more stories here

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,350
these ones aren't these ones aren't

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:45,000
really puns just stories that I guess

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,590
the theme is collapsed so I'm just going

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,280

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,810
