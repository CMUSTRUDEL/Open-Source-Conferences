Title: Farmhouse Conf 5 The Collapse of Hope & Letting Go of What Could Have Been by Willo O'Brien
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Farmhouse Conf 5
Description: 
	Launching our big ideas into the world takes courage & moxy. We dive in, our eyes twinkling with possibility and hope, and if we're lucky we catalyze collaborators, supportive fans, customers and a community along the way. But what happens when you've lost that loving feeling? Or when you realize it's time to let go of the baby you've put your blood, sweat & tears into and move on? Letting go of what could have been may just take more courage & moxy than getting the idea off the ground in the first place.

are you mentally prepared emotionally

00:00:05,979 --> 00:00:16,209
spiritually okay so hello Brian was one

00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:20,439
of the organizers of yes why yes yes it

00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:23,289
was this awesome little event conference

00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:26,319
of sorts sort of unconference yes the

00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:30,419
hole that was at the ACE and impulse for

00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:33,280
ya raising hands up who was there and it

00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:35,170
was for me personally it was sort of

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,059
like nerd summer camp where we just like

00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,090
we're sort of nerd spring break we just

00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:41,949
hung out the pool a lot like you do at

00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,829
the ace in Palm Springs but instead of

00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:47,469
talking about whatever we talked about

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,839
you know startups and design and Mike we

00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:53,550
had a ND web camp meet up in the pool

00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:56,890
that was fun we talked about you know

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,079
decentralized data ownership mumble

00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,289
mumble but in the pool and there was a

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,140
problem and Willow was kind enough to

00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:07,600
hop on the speaker roster like three

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,230
days ago when I had two speakers

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:18,070
canceled on me in one day so give it up

00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:19,960
for willow yeah it's a good thing that

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,820
this is just kind of like stream of

00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,250
thought storytelling cuz I was like okay

00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,960
well I have an idea but it was like two

00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,080
days ago that we decided for me to be

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,710
here so but it's really great because

00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,140
I'm so happy to be here and I've seen

00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,000
this and heard of it and just like

00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,590
thrilled to be a part of it and I know

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,640
it's also bittersweet though because of

00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:45,400
the last one which is exactly what my

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,770
talk is about actually it's um the

00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,700
collapse of hope and letting go of what

00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:55,210
could have been and so very similar to

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,980
this that you know he started and who

00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,220
here has like started a big idea

00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,930
launched a company who hears an

00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,570
entrepreneur can I say a raise of hands

00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,070
you consider yourself an entrepreneur

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,150
who here is an artist consider

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,150
themselves like an artist

00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:17,800
so uh the the collapse of Hope which

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,030
sounds so dramatic but i think that

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,350
essentially anytime you start something

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,540
big I have made like big bold leaps in

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,000
my life and the first one was probably

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,380
ten years ago when I first went out on

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,650
my own I've been out of my own for like

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,560
ten years and got laid off actually and

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,120
so I was like okay well um you know I

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,310
feel like I've known pretty much what I

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,440
wanted to do and like Who I am a lot of

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,090
my life but you get laid off or

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,220
something happens like that and all of a

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,390
sudden like the bottom drops out from

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,730
underneath you and you're kind of like

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,060
lost you know that lost feeling or

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,890
you're like um what do I do next and so

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,680
I feel like there's kind of two things

00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,820
there right like there's the feeling

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,530
like you know what you're doing which is

00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,150
like kind of connected be feeling

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,890
connected to your purpose or what you're

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,650
creating or what people are counting on

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,570
you for and then there's like good to

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,190
maybe make money as well like there's

00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,340
like that financial security and

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,650
stability so there I think there's two

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,840
ways that we can feel kind of like lost

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,730
is either we're sort of in our

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,320
fight-or-flight mode of like holy should

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,960
i need to actually make money and figure

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,520
this out or we're just feeling like lost

00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,830
at sea in terms of what we're supposed

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,810
to be doing and where we're at and i

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,450
think that this happens really big time

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,160
into like three different main main

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,930
areas probably one is like when you lose

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,980
a job or have something going on with

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,160
your career where you're like what am I

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,600
supposed to do next and um the second

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,430
one would be like you know after

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,960
relationship ends and you're kind of

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,360
just like oh my god you have that

00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,840
feeling of like there's a hole where

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,760
that once was and talk about that

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,170
feeling of like that hope of what could

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,900
have been if you've ever been in a

00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,810
situation where you either have launched

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,100
a business and you so like the farmhouse

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,350
is such a great example that's right

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,560
like he's he's pulled together this huge

00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:09,080
entire community of fans and supporters

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,270
and like it's finally kind of on the map

00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,530
so once he puts it out like okay farm

00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,320
outside is coming like everyone

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,620
registers and it's like to just let that

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,169
go like what happens next right so my

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,100
bike's getting back to a personal story

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,230
of that is

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,710
so I went out on my own like 10 years

00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:30,140
ago and then about five years into it I

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,210
was doing like web and flash design

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:37,190
graphic design flash totally dates makes

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,690
those I'm so far go but I doing

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,160
illustration and then I was like I want

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,000
to do my own thing I want to do my own

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,650
baby so I started a line of gift line so

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,420
i was like designer tees and tote bags

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,360
and greeting cards and it was Willow

00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,860
Tunes where dekhe meets rock and roll so

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,790
is for the geeks and the rockers many of

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,910
you guys would have loved with the

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,830
t-shirts I'm sure and so that was so fun

00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,170
and so I did that for a couple years and

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,730
I loved it and it was the same thing

00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,470
right very similar to this where like

00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,630
I'd catalyzed this whole awesome

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,520
community of fans like I'd see my

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,010
t-shirts in the wild and people be like

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,140
what it's like with this whole thing it

00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,990
was so exciting and a couple of years

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,880
into it I was like ah I suck at folding

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:21,110
t-shirts by the way I like absolute

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,420
forgot it and stress like stretto sorry

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,070
I'm stuff like stresses me out like

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,780
having all this inventory just like

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,850
stressed me out so I was like I don't

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:33,110
think this is my like the business for

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:35,660
me after all and and so I I was like but

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,040
what else do i do I was so kind of like

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,690
wrapped up I mean that was a very

00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,300
particular case in the sense that like

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,370
the name of my company was very much

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,110
like willow tunes like I was will willow

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,740
tunes I was part of that company so my

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,570
identity was really wrapped up in it and

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,670
but I also so I was like okay I want to

00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,530
move on but this was like my big jump

00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,230
right like this is my big thing that I

00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,910
had created and this is what people know

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,090
me as this is what I do like what else

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,890
would I possibly do so it felt really I

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,380
felt like okay well I know I want to

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,180
move on but what else do I do thankfully

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,720
I was able to actually find at that

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,390
point a startup that I joined on with

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,150
and that was so exciting and I was like

00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:19,130
yes and so I just put my all into it and

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,950
I was co-founder this startup which also

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,110
helped people who are making and selling

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,850
things it's called storenvy and so I

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,130
joined on as a co-founder there and

00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,860
they're kinda like a competitor to Etsy

00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,380
and it's like a social shopping

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,550
marketplace so I did that and worked my

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,400
ass off for like six months

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,050
and long story short we ended up like

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,670
bringing a huge community and got

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,380
funding and then I was like something

00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,480
this isn't something's not right I need

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,240
to like hop back out be on my own again

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,190
and so it was like again kind of that

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,710
like okay well wait a second what am i

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,570
doing now you know so it's like this

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,220
journey it's like the classic hero's

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,440
journey if any of you guys know Joseph

00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,970
Campbell it's such a classic hero's

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,450
journey I think of like how we go

00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,700
through our lives of finding ourselves

00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,620
feeling like okay this is it I'm so on

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,270
board I'm so in the on the track of

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,890
where I'm supposed to be and then all of

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,780
a sudden kind of finding ourselves like

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,280
wait a second where am i what am i what

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,640
am i doing again like I thought that was

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,440
it and now it's not and so here I am so

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,960
that here I actually did a video series

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,300
that was all I've learned a lot from

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,760
basically like working my ass off and as

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,470
an artist or as a creative I have gotten

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,100
really passionate about how important it

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:34,140
is to take care of ourselves so sore

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,910
like self-care and even staying

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,560
connected to your inspiration what you

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,680
love because I think a lot of times when

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,960
we're doing what we love we can

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,030
sometimes I'll like almost get that like

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,920
resentment or like we're so burned out

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,710
or so spread so thin that we're like

00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,000
wait a second joint am I am I supposed

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,710
to be doing this I thought this is what

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,050
I love but I'm kind of hating it right

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,820
now and so really looking at that like

00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,580
burnout so I created a whole video

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,020
series all about that and it was on that

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,420
track and actually then found another

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,630
startup and joined on as a with another

00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,580
startup but long story short that i was

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,290
at for like a year same thing it went

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,680
really great and then let that go and

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,240
the whole this whole like fascinating

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,770
thing so i think when we let go of

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,060
something right so i was in that same

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,490
situation where i was like we'll wait a

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,620
second I was like co-founder you're into

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,210
the end like no matter what happens and

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,860
not all of a sudden I realized like

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,590
something's missing something's not

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,230
right and the way that I say it is

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,480
essentially I've had this career path of

00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,240
like following my feeling the fear and

00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,910
following my heart anyway so even when

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,130
it's totally scary or just feels

00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,560
completely like lost it's like I think

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,230
this is about listening listening really

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,660
closely to what is within you that's

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,320
what's missing right first of all with

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,300
what's missing

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,460
and I realized that I was trying to be

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,740
whatever I could right it's kind of like

00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,390
in a partnership right where you're just

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,890
like I'm going to just be the best

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,450
person I can in this I'm going to just

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,030
try to give it my all even though

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,160
something's not quite right and yet then

00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,690
at the same time when you let go and

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,360
when you're like I don't know something

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,560
is missing even if it's right for like

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,880
so say we're even talking about a

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,620
relationship whether it's like

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,660
co-founder being a co-founder and

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,480
startup is very so much and like a

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,670
marriage or relationship and even when

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,680
you let go even though it's good and

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,450
best for both parties there's still that

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,180
life morning that has to take place

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,220
because of what could have been right

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,200
you start it with this like these

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,300
grandiose visions of like what this

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,710
could be and how great it could be but

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,480
then all of a sudden when you have to

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,860
let go and then there's even that weird

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,690
thing of like when you break up with

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,700
somebody and you have to then share it

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,530
with other people and you'll have to

00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,260
almost like sit through their morning

00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,840
I'm like their grief about half you

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,970
letting go of your relationship so I

00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,140
think it's an interesting thing so I

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,200
think number one it starts with

00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,480
listening really closely to and then now

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,670
I feel like I also because i have

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,850
listened so well i feel like i'm

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,520
completely on my path which feels so

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,770
cool to be like doing my calling at the

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,050
heart of it you know it sound so boo boo

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,940
i'm sure about like it just feels like

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,770
so amazing like i want that feeling for

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,720
everybody you know and it's i feel like

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,970
there's so much self-discovery that

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,380
happens when you are in entrepreneur

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,540
you're an artist and you're actually

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,910
just really trying to lick listen listen

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,040
listen and keep acting on that and then

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,050
to also create a business out of it

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,790
we're actually like you know marketing

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,080
it to other people and their then signed

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,900
on with your vision so it's like almost

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,370
the same thing over again right like

00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,740
catalyzing these awesome like customers

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,690
and fans in a community and just hoping

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,640
that they're going to like rally on and

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,900
stay with you through your various

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,940
incarnations of creations so it's pretty

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,280
exciting there's actually I just put out

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,650
this course that's called harvest and

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,540
thrive which is essentially all about

00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,250
like leveraging the harvest so like if

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,499
you've had this like long career of

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,209
wherever you've been in your career it's

00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:07,149
what's the thread so it's like you don't

00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:08,919
have to so great example even is Shane

00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,019
in this farmhouse conference that he

00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:13,029
doesn't need to like completely go out

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:14,739
there and like you know what I say is

00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,749
like he doesn't have to like find brand

00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:18,489
new fields and like plow the fields and

00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:20,949
plant new seeds like he already has this

00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:23,469
like really really rich harvests right

00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:25,119
here of like people and community and so

00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:27,069
like whatever he decides to do next he

00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:28,719
can actually leverage this but they're

00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:30,279
so often than I see artists and

00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:32,019
entrepreneurs that think i have to like

00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,299
reinvent the wheel or start something

00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:36,039
brand new but it's so beautiful to

00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:37,809
remember that you have so much like

00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:39,189
that's within you and it's you know your

00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:40,929
community and everything that you can

00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:43,479
really tie that together and keep going

00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:44,919
so there's one specific module in this

00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:47,169
course that i'm super super excited

00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:49,959
about and it's called gathering the

00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:52,269
courage and i think it's because if i

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,519
have done anything if I've like studied

00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:56,829
anything the last couple years it's been

00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,749
about courage right which there's

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:00,879
courage and in starting something new

00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:02,979
there's kurds and making big bold leaps

00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,629
of joining on as a co-founder and like

00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:07,599
letting go of my other companies and all

00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:10,059
these things and it's like I've almost

00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:12,759
gotten good at that right like really

00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:15,939
good at when it's super scary just going

00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:18,399
for it and really catalyzing like that

00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:20,259
movement but it takes major courage it

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,259
takes courage listening and trusting

00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:25,419
trusting that's all going to be okay and

00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:27,819
I think also that it takes like

00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:30,339
acceptance sort of i phi like even drill

00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:32,799
down some core things about this whole

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:35,739
like letting go and moving on or we're

00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,049
making big jumps it's i think comes down

00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:39,220
to first of all forgiveness especially

00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,679
in the letting go whether it's a

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,569
relationship or an old job that didn't

00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,939
go well or position that didn't go well

00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:48,639
it's like that forgiveness of just like

00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:50,709
forgiveness and acceptance of just like

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,379
okay how can I just accept that this is

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,869
what's going on and like it is what it

00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:57,369
is and kind of forgive myself maybe for

00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:58,899
something not working out or forgive

00:12:57,369 --> 00:13:02,799
someone else for something not working

00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:05,259
out and then like listening to stay and

00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,239
listen and kind of gathering that

00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:08,829
courage one thing and I love it that

00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:10,689
there's actually a talk on this today um

00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,609
I think her name's Julie that's talking

00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:14,589
about this the one from github is all

00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:15,769
about resilience and I was like that

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:16,910
tizen so perfect

00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:22,249
so I'm so excited to hear her talk

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:24,350
because it's yes because um that's one

00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:27,170
thing is like we are such resilient

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,610
creatures it's it's the one thing that I

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,949
feel like we can always really count on

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,989
is so while this title of my talk was

00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:34,639
like the collapse of hope the beautiful

00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:37,459
thing is that we're such resilient

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,619
creatures that that while we may find

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:42,199
ourselves in a place of like feeling

00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:44,239
really lost sometimes or feeling really

00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:46,069
hopeless or feeling really like what the

00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:48,649
 is going on with my life where am i

00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:50,600
and what's happening we inevitably it

00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,970
then all of a sudden see a glimmer and

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,069
see the light and find our way out of it

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,959
and and find yourself on the next

00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:58,959
journey thank you

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,620
