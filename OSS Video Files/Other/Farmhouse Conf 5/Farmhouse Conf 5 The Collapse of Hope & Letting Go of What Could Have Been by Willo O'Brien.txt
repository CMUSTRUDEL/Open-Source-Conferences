Description: 
	Launching our big ideas into the world takes courage & moxy. We dive in, our eyes twinkling with possibility and hope, and if we're lucky we catalyze collaborators, supportive fans, customers and a community along the way. But what happens when you've lost that loving feeling? Or when you realize it's time to let go of the baby you've put your blood, sweat & tears into and move on? Letting go of what could have been may just take more courage & moxy than getting the idea off the ground in the first place.
