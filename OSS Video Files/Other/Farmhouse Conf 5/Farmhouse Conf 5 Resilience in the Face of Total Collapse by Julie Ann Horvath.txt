Description: 
	Every end collapse marks a new beginning. But where does momentum to start something new come from? Where does resilence originate?

I want to tell you all my own story of personal resilience and how the best of things can come from the worst of situations. Or, how I learned to take power away from those who thrive on negativity and conflict and use it to create beautfiul movements of empowerment for those of us who deserve a better world.
