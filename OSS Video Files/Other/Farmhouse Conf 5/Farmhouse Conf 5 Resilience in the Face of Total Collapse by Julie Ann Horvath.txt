Title: Farmhouse Conf 5 Resilience in the Face of Total Collapse by Julie Ann Horvath
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Farmhouse Conf 5
Description: 
	Every end collapse marks a new beginning. But where does momentum to start something new come from? Where does resilence originate?

I want to tell you all my own story of personal resilience and how the best of things can come from the worst of situations. Or, how I learned to take power away from those who thrive on negativity and conflict and use it to create beautfiul movements of empowerment for those of us who deserve a better world.

00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,880
ignoring you it's that I'm preparing to

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:28,680
blow your mind so I want to start out

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,940
with them a little story about my

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,950
introduction to San Francisco actually

00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,290
I'm from San Francisco I'm actually from

00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,689
the east bay south of oakland california

00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:43,030
how many people here know where oakland

00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:47,290
is oh sweet it's also fun so that's why

00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,759
I'm from I moved to San Francisco to go

00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,950
to school and I'm going to tell you

00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:56,740
first about one of my experiences in a

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:58,780
classroom I am also biracial and there's

00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,240
some an amazing blog post that someone

00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,909
just put out its entitled coming out is

00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,829
biracial I recommend you read that if

00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,420
you're confused as to why this very

00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:09,489
white girl is calling herself biracial

00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:14,200
and it turns out there's this thing

00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:16,240
called genetics and it's a pretty much

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,490
chance with the who's

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,310
whose features you end up with but so

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,170
I'm biracial I am half mexican and half

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,890
white my mother's from Texas that is

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:32,530
very very very European wipe or at least

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:34,480
that's what she told me so I started

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,900
school at you at the University of San

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,410
Francisco and it was immediately like a

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:45,850
very affluent school a lot of white

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:47,830
people nice white folk and and it was

00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,760
it's always been a little overwhelming

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:53,470
to me to be around mostly white people

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,320
because that's not how I grew up I grew

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,990
up in a very diverse environment I was

00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,240
one of you know ten identified a white

00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,470
kids at my high school and since I

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,240
always been a little awkward and I've

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,130
always felt a little privileged for

00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,890
having been able to blend in and not

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,450
really stand out but there were specific

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,530
conversations that were had in

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,410
classrooms that made me incredibly

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,760
uncomfortable and I kind of just wanted

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,590
to share this with you because it's

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,320
pretty unbelievable that this happens

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:24,160
and our profit Center says someone

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:29,170
referred to them earlier so this

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,820
conversation originated while we were

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,560
discussing wide specific immigrant

00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,470
groups occupied certain parts of San

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,340
Francisco and the conversation quickly

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:42,510
devolved into why white people were the

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,770
most wealthy predominantly in the US and

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,720
that was that was already a little hard

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,820
but then you know this these words were

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,900
said verbatim white people are the

00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,840
richest because they work the hardest

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:59,350
and I and and i was i was 18 i think at

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,970
this point and terrified like my jaw was

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:06,040
just kind of on the floor at this point

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:08,080
um but i don't think that anybody really

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,820
noticed why I was upset and I was

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,080
looking around trying to find an ally

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,459
you know like trying to make eyes of

00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,120
someone who is like yeah this is just

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:18,700
crazy didn't come easy but it got even

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:23,050
worse I got to the point where the class

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:25,600
decided was help from the instructor dad

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,610
white people you know lived on the you

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,009
know they didn't want to live next to

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:34,300
ethnic people because ethnic

00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:37,059
we're always asking them for money and I

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,009
you know and as somewhat like I don't

00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:40,449
know if it was a really weird thing for

00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:42,520
me because I don't think people expect

00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,379
me to be upset about that and my article

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,199
I mentioned the girl talks a lot about

00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:48,399
how people will say really racist

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,990
in front of her because they think oh

00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,300
you're white like of course that's okay

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,919
it's really not okay anyways at that

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,409
point it was made really clear to me

00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,309
that there wasn't space for people like

00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:03,249
me in that institution and I didn't

00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:08,080
really quite experience that again until

00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:09,789
I joined tech technology but this is a

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,370
different kind of space I mean there

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:14,499
definitely isn't a lot of diversity as

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,419
far as ethnicity goes or background but

00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:23,469
there's also not a lot of gender

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:25,629
diversity this is an incredibly personal

00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:27,370
story for me by the way the first time

00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:30,520
I've told it and how do you guys all

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,439
know what chatham house rules are what I

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,990
say stays here I would really appreciate

00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:38,740
it I'd like to go home to a job that

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:41,949
would be really awesome I kept my head

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,409
so um I recently took a trip to Rwanda

00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:46,689
and it was an amazing experience for me

00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:48,999
and I tried really hard to sit down with

00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:50,620
people and connect with them just know

00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:52,240
what their life is like day-to-day like

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,909
what are their challenges what you know

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,139
try to see if I could even relate to

00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,459
them in any way possible it was

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,729
definitely the most culturally different

00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:02,860
place I've ever been but one thing I was

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:05,949
having a conversation with a young lady

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,610
by the name of Diana and she she kind of

00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:11,499
summed up her attitude towards feeling

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,330
marginalized and she said you just

00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:17,559
accept you just learn to accept your

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,629
circumstances and there's this for some

00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:22,509
reason there's this really thought to

00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:25,089
pardon me that says no that like I

00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:28,569
have never I've always had this idea in

00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:29,979
my head that I know people deserve more

00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:33,189
than that and especially the people i

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,749
know who you know or my friends and my

00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:36,370
family and i don't think they deserve

00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:38,490
less because they're women i don't think

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,349
they deserve less because they they're

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,449
mexican or black or you know subscribe

00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:44,189
to any kind of

00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,719
just a good religion there's all of

00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:48,360
these different facets of life and I

00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:53,789
don't think anyone deserves less because

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:55,319
of them so i told myself then back in

00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,509
school that back after that happened I

00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,800
went home crying by the way just bawling

00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,360
because i didn't i didn't know what to

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,710
do there's nothing you really can do i

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,809
didn't feel like anything I could say

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,129
could change those people's minds and

00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:07,949
like they were pretty made up about it

00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:11,339
and pretty sure about their conclusions

00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:13,199
in school at least um I was just really

00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:14,969
shocked and I you know I went home and I

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,400
just you know I cried a lot and I called

00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:19,439
my mom and she was like Julie there's

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,610
just there's just idiots everywhere like

00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,029
you're always going to run into those

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,089
people don't let them see you you know

00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:29,719
drown so I told myself that day I said

00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:32,580
the harder I push now for people like me

00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:34,439
the more space I can make for them or

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:39,240
the easier it will be for them to follow

00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:41,249
in my footsteps so um previous to

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,949
college my childhood was a lot about

00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:46,949
turning disadvantages into into a niche

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:49,680
and letting them and like inform my

00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:52,199
decision making and I hit kind of a bump

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,819
when I got into college so um twenty

00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,300
percent just to get some like statistics

00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:59,249
about the area I'm from and what um I

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,659
here on articulate I got a lot in high

00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:03,449
schools like Julie why you talk so white

00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:06,209
and I'm like uh I'm white like that's

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,680
why I talk so I and also TV like I just

00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:10,169
watched a lot of TV when I was younger

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:15,120
probably cartoons and I just made me

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:16,499
sound like a snob i guess um so twenty

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,050
percent of students at my high school

00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:20,610
are accepted into college six percent of

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,909
those students finish or graduate with a

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:26,849
degree I great some graduate it 11 thin

00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:28,740
my high school class of 657 and nearly

00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:31,439
failed every single one of my college

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,089
classes when I got there I was really

00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,800
behind and that was just based on the

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,800
public education system that I came from

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,000
I was smart within the context of

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,519
Hayward or within the place I come from

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,639
but not nationally at least not

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,709
competitively so life kind of drove me

00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,660
into the arms of the Internet actually I

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:54,449
wanted to know how to catch up and I

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,010
wanted to know what I could learn to

00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:58,740
kind of faked my way

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,780
into feeling like I'm I'm on the same

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,250
level or the same playing field does

00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,720
everybody else that I saw around me I

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,120
know I was just as smart as I'm I just

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,550
didn't know what skills I could provide

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:13,110
in order to become painted the same way

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:14,970
that they are so life is all about

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,680
making adjustments I hate sports

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,900
analogies usually but it really is a

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,460
game of inches and so I started to learn

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:25,350
to make adjustments I left college early

00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,880
my first startup boss asked me actually

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,440
like how much do you need to leave

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,170
college full time I was like 45 Grand

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,910
and he was like oh sure you got it I

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,920
didn't realize at the time and I was

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,780
being in credit like low-balled because

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,390
to me that seems like a lot of money

00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,340
like my mom retired after 35 years of

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:47,070
working for the court system you know

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,630
she retired at a salary of 50k and so to

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,700
me I was like holy in a year i'm

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,630
going to outpace my own mom I didn't

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:58,530
realize the class cap was that that big

00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:01,230
or that wide and so I took a very low

00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,660
salary net which I hadn't come basically

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,830
because it kind of set the stage for how

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:12,900
I expected to be treated and paid and

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:14,490
dealt with in the future so I really

00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,190
always felt like there was a chip on my

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,700
shoulder from both my childhood and my

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:22,620
education and I think that chip really

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,700
showed a lot I think it came out in

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,490
resentful ways and mean jokes and

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,470
unfortunately things I can't take back

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,470
the ones I got into my 20s I realized I

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,180
could choose who I want to be when I was

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,360
a kid I didn't have a choice in what

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,190
environment I got put in and but when I

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,570
you know once I realized that I was free

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,630
of that environment it was up to me to

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,400
make my own the phase I'm going through

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:51,600
right now is making peace with who I am

00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:54,900
my past and also where I come from

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,970
there's this amazing moment in the movie

00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,340
away we go has anyone seen that movie

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,550
the focus feature it's incredible Maya

00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:05,340
Rudolph this amazing story that she

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,980
tells in the movie in sentence so she

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,080
grew up on this big like plantation type

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,000
house and

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,830
on the Mississippi and she said that

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,550
they had an orange tree outside of their

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:19,000
house and she says that her dad would go

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,170
outside every day and look at this thing

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,560
sprouted fruit because he really liked

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,210
it was like a hope thing for him and so

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,880
every day he would do this and every day

00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:31,460
nothing would grow and so one day her

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,740
her mom and her sister went and glued a

00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,690
bunch of plastic fruit to the tree and

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,460
they hid in the truck and they waited

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:43,220
for their dad to come and when he came

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:47,330
she said that heat for a moment it felt

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,400
real for like a moment he believed that

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,010
the tree and magnificently sprouted all

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:56,030
like bananas and grapes and all these

00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:58,280
things that don't grow together but what

00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,590
I took that to mean is really like you

00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,330
you make your own family like you make

00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:05,150
your own future you meet you get to

00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,640
choose what things you keep in your life

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,130
and what things you can push out and

00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,740
what people I think this is so like a

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,690
really beautiful metaphor for friendship

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:19,190
and the people you want to work with as

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:22,130
well so when I first heard about github

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:26,360
I was really in love with the idea of it

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,740
I love the idea of open Technology

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,140
because that's how I learned I'm all

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,090
self-taught and I learned from

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,730
around on the internet quick i went from

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,380
opening up web inspector and learning

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,930
how to reading other people's code and

00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:42,080
so I loved the idea of github as being

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,970
central to that idea of openness and

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,010
what I loved about github was it wasn't

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,450
built to run a single person it was

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,370
built around a single idea and that's

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,850
open source and it's such a powerful

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:55,820
idea that it always out like it always

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,200
outshined any of the founders and it

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,700
seemed like everyone had an equal

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:04,060
investment and the openness of the web

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:08,030
but from the moment i joined github i

00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:11,360
started fighting a very hard fight from

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:15,320
basic communication things to being told

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,850
to watch my tone and which is if you're

00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,190
a feminist probably the one thing that

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,060
just like makes your skin crawl

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,880
I've had some pretty terrible

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,860
experiences but I'm still in love with

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,180
the eighth with what github stands for

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,340
because i think it's bigger than any of

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,920
us i think the idea of open source and

00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,410
being able to contribute to it community

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:45,130
is an amazing idea that none of us can

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:48,190
kill so one of the hardest truce or

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,190
lessons that I had to learn was that

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,570
people won't do the right thing people

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,480
won't do the right thing if it even

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:59,050
slightly inconvenient system or their

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,960
personal lives or their day-to-day my

00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,820
big thing with who I work with and Trust

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,890
is like can I trust you to be the person

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,390
you say you are just a matter for

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,850
different if we think different things

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,890
if we believe in different things but

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:16,120
can I trust you to be the person you say

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:20,620
you are I ran into someone who I felt I

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:24,460
could it and this person was supposed to

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,860
be leading me and that was so hard for

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,200
me it was heartbreaking for me to deal

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:33,010
with I honestly felt like I was looking

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,940
at a wolf in sheep's clothing and then I

00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,980
was the only one who could see it the

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,770
thing about growing up kind of in the

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,200
ghetto so ridiculous when I say that out

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,210
loud the thing about growing up there is

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,700
you know who the bad people are like you

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,230
can see them there are people you know

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,520
they're drug dealers they're people

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,620
carry guns I mean don't get me wrong

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,780
they're sneaky people there as well but

00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:01,150
in our tech earn our industry they're

00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:03,460
sneakier like you don't know who they

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:08,800
are until it's time for them to make the

00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:11,910
decision between right and wrong I felt

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,980
in a lot of ways that I had been lied to

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:18,090
I felt alone and afraid and really

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,370
threatened it took me back to this place

00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:23,710
like I only had myself to depend on and

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:27,700
it made me distrust everyone not just

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:32,410
this one person some of this is my own

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:35,209
problem my coping plate was totally full

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:40,519
but a lot of it was the environment it

00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:41,930
was toxic it was people refusing to

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,589
acknowledge a problem because it was

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:49,839
inconvenient for them and I was doing

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:49,839
the only thing I knew how to do nothing

00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,579
at the time I didn't know what to do I

00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,709
was afraid to tell anyone what was going

00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,329
on because I'd lose my job but I was

00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:01,910
miserable misled and severely

00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:04,040
disillusioned I was mostly afraid to

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,339
rock the boat disturb the utopia that my

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,709
friends had made a home for some reason

00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:12,890
I let this negative situation consume me

00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:16,730
I felt my world collapsing in on myself

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:21,470
and on me I was drowning and I was stuck

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:23,420
I was looking for guidance and it wasn't

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,070
until I looked out into the community

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,760
that i found that guidance that I really

00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:30,470
needed or my truth and there's a

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,459
wonderful woman by the name of gin

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,560
Meyers and she's a designer developer

00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:39,140
she works at dev bootcamp but he is a

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,449
fantastic writer and I found her I

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,839
stumbled upon her blog for her blog post

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:46,490
first before any of her work and it's an

00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,220
amazing piece called how to avoid

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,500
feminist burnout I'm going to read you

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,350
this portion that really kind of

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,800
switched the light on for me and really

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,540
just kicked me in the ass it takes a lot

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,130
of courage to tell people in a position

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,230
of power and privilege that they are

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,000
doing something wrong and even more

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,919
courage to withstand the abuse you will

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,140
take as a result as a result of that in

00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,730
order to do it you have to grow a thick

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,240
skin and learn how to stand your ground

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,530
but when making sure they they don't get

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,850
away with their it's equally

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,040
important not to let their

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,500
dictate the rules of the game remember

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:26,299
the saying never wrestle with a pig you

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:29,030
get dirty in the pig likes it row

00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:31,179
continues see kinds of people even those

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:33,290
who aren't kind of you this may sound

00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:35,120
like it takes more energy out of you

00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,580
than meeting hate with hate I once

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,669
thought so but hate takes so much more

00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:44,210
energy out of you so much more you don't

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:46,080
have to lavish kindness on but

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,330
forgive them and move on

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,090
chances are they're horribly unhappy and

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,340
Confused themselves your hatred will

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,039
only strengthen their defensive myths

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,179
and exhaust you also there's always the

00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,740
chance that one of them just need

00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:02,070
someone to be kind of them to consider a

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:05,039
different viewpoints so after reading

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,500
months I decided to stop lending the

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,539
toxicity the power it needed to survive

00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,649
or sustain itself and put all of my

00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,019
energy into creating the right

00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:15,330
environment so that the next time doing

00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:18,360
the right thing could be could maybe be

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,769
easier to choose to make clearer what's

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,210
wrong and what's right and to surface

00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:27,210
and give power to the voices who have

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:30,870
rightfully deserve with it it's hard to

00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:33,179
remember this but it's a really good

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,669
staple of mine now if everyone is doing

00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,980
their best some people's best really

00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:39,659
 suck like sometimes I have to

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,690
look at people I'm like Todd your best

00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:46,860
stuff today your best is making my life

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:49,370
hell but it's your best and I Otis I

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,240
gotta take it man I got to take it so

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,669
it's a really great thing to remember

00:18:51,240 --> 00:19:02,039
you know when when people are being

00:18:53,669 --> 00:19:04,260
dicks so about a year ago I came up with

00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,909
an idea and I was like you know what I

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,549
actually know a lot of really badass

00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:10,110
women I had been I felt trampled after

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,450
that whole negative incident and I

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,630
wanted to put my like all of all of my

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,919
frustration into something positive and

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,710
so I was like you know what I know I've

00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,269
been following and you know taking tabs

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,279
on all these fantastic women that I

00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:25,110
think would give amazing talks and I

00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,820
want to bring them here to github and I

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,610
want them to stand up in front of a room

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,230
of all men all women whatever and I want

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,360
them to speak of their truth and I want

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:37,139
people to be more exposed to women as

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,029
leaders and so in this next part of the

00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:42,120
talk in which i call changing the world

00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:45,269
by one sneaky maneuver at a time i can i

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:51,330
can i created a repo under my personal

00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:52,860
account privacy and and i basically came

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,779
up with the idea for passion projects

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,539
which is if you haven't seen it at all

00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,299
it's an all-female Talk series where I

00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:04,080
by women from all walks of tech

00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:07,769
community management to really loud

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,659
helicopters engineers designers

00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:12,739
everything in between Jessica his shoes

00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:15,869
here is given a talk at passion projects

00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:18,629
and so I decided to come up with I came

00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:20,669
up with this idea very small seed and i

00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:22,049
created a repo for it and i did all the

00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,460
legwork like you know people are very

00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,929
comfortable if you hand them bulleted

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,190
lists you know so I'm like I'll just

00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:27,869
make all these bulleted lists for all

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,039
these people but I decided I was just

00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:32,879
going to do it and I was going to wait

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:35,009
until someone told me no I got really

00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:37,049
tired of everyone talking about how we

00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:39,570
should hire more women hire more women

00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:42,059
and this is coming out of the same men

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,519
who refused to treat me as their peer

00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:47,220
and it's funny I actually got an email

00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:51,320
the other day that was like how are

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,999
women at github and as I go ask them I

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:58,580
don't speak for them that's a weird

00:20:53,999 --> 00:21:00,659
thing to ask um really fun really fun um

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,950
you know and a lot of the stuffs not

00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,809
malicious I think it's just really

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,299
people have no idea what they're

00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:08,700
saying or they or they just come from a

00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:11,039
different world which is okay too it's

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,279
all of our jobs to educate them to

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,590
correct them um kind of lost my bro

00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,789
anyway so I put this all into repo and I

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,429
got up we have these things called

00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:22,320
github summits every we assume every six

00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:23,609
months now we do them once a year but

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,769
everyone has the opportunity to give a

00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:28,200
lightning talk for five minutes so it

00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:30,779
was perfect because one of my colleagues

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,549
and one of my founders got up right

00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,229
before me and talked about how important

00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:36,419
it would be for us to focus on hiring

00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:39,809
women developers now I go great this

00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:42,210
talk again and so right after that I was

00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:44,489
like I have something and I like go up

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,080
and I pitch passion projects to them and

00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:47,820
I'm like these are the speakers i want

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,039
to invite and I'm like oh get up will

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,139
you bankroll this and I put them

00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,639
completely on the spot because I was

00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:57,049
like oh but you really care about women

00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:59,639
developers this is clearly something

00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:08,730
like you just that I swipe that I

00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:10,230
reported it pretty ballsy um and lo and

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,450
behold the only founder sitting in the

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,590
front row

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,330
poor guys feel really bad about this

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,669
actually he had all the pressure on him

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,629
to you know say and I was like hey if

00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,820
they're gonna say no to me they're going

00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:22,529
to say no in front of 200 people and I

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,149
wanted to make it as easy for women to

00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:26,149
say yes to speaking in this series so I

00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:28,169
wanted them to pay for travel hotel

00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:30,149
transportation costs I wanted to be

00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:32,249
super flexible I wanted to have been

00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,720
picked the month they came and spoke I

00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:35,220
wanted to speak about anything they

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,480
wanted to speak about and github was

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:41,850
going to sit there and listen so poor

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,159
Tom from the front I think he felt the

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,609
pressure of 200 employees breathing down

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,749
his neck but he gave me the thumbs up

00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:50,580
and I was like great i'm gonna run with

00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:53,789
this until no one until someone gets in

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,259
my way so so that was the birth of

00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,499
passion project so i got up i got up

00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,909
into that that was really fun and then

00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:01,320
what i did was i transferred the repo

00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:04,409
over to github and I said okay let's

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,700
crowdsource I already had a list I I I

00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:07,830
wanted to do something really special

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,570
for these woman because I think that as

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,609
a woman in half you get blanketed with

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,220
just email after email I come speak at

00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:15,749
our event because you're a woman that's

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,580
kind of lame like I want these people to

00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:18,809
feel really bad ass and special like

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,669
they've caught my attention that caught

00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:22,499
my co-workers attention I was going to

00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:25,529
feel great and so what I did was I super

00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:30,029
stock them on the Internet I got all of

00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:32,399
their dresses and then I continued but

00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:34,169
and I am so I'm mostly a web designer

00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:37,470
I'm really comfortable drawing bosses in

00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:39,119
HTML and CSS it's great but I challenge

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,440
myself because I wanted and the thing

00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,259
about being a designer and starting

00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,210
something like this I was able to do all

00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:47,279
of the creative work for this like

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,749
basically on my own and just ship it I'm

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,539
just like a I'll just do it and

00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:52,559
so I am without like any approval it was

00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,820
just I was just like oh this is

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,929
happening that's what you got to tell

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,399
people you gotta tell him no it's just

00:23:54,929 --> 00:24:01,379
happening don't let him ask questions

00:23:56,399 --> 00:24:04,379
that's the bad part um and so we that's

00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:07,889
really bad so we um so I designed like

00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:09,629
these hatley personalized invites that

00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:11,460
were probably pretty horrible but I was

00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:13,499
so proud of them when you send something

00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,480
to print it's not like putting it on the

00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:17,009
web because in the web i can push a page

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,869
builds of something in eight seconds

00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:21,149
when i send something to print on shaky

00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:23,519
and pouring sweat just like parks I'm

00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:24,720
like if I it up oh well but I got

00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:29,400
known and given me a budget

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,470
so that was fun and but anyway so I

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,390
printed these invitations supersoft them

00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,909
for their addresses and I just mailed

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,799
out all these invitations with like we

00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:39,780
had these really special github only

00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:41,640
hoodies that had a pink octa cat on it

00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,590
and it was reserved only for staff and

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,059
the significant others of staff but I

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,220
wanted to kind of like invite these

00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:49,380
women into like our secret club like I

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,640
wanted them to feel really special and I

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,780
wanted them to know that we really

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,600
appreciate the work that they're doing

00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,700
and in technology whether or not they're

00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,270
a COO whether or not they're a designer

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,340
developer thanks doesn't matter like

00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:06,000
badass women really really matter in our

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:09,000
community um and so I sent these invites

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,640
out and then I and then I had surgery so

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,900
I actually know first first was the

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,809
website so i made a website because

00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,370
that's how things get real things are

00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:22,200
real if they have a web page by the way

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:23,730
no one can stop me now and anyway so i

00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,169
sent out the invites and i had had

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,500
surgery and i was sick for about three

00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:30,750
weeks and then I start getting these um

00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,429
so literally like a physical collapse um

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,260
but I start getting all these emails

00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:36,360
back because i had left on the invite

00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,100
you know replied a passionate github com

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,440
if here if you're interested in speaking

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,030
and I start getting flooded with all of

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,130
these emails where people are just like

00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:46,350
oh my god this is amazing i'm so excited

00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,120
like thank you so much for all the stuff

00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:50,220
and even the few people who couldn't

00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,049
make it they said you know i'm gonna

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,700
wear this hoodie every day so you know

00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:56,100
Kurt like I created like this group of

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,870
super fans amongst this incredibly

00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,059
talented group of women and I was really

00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,100
proud of that was really proud of that

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,240
and so I was like oh i get that was

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,740
like my oh moment where I was like

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,600
oh now I actually have to do the

00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,789
legwork oh you actually have to make

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,890
this happen but it's weird because the

00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:13,230
team that formed around passion projects

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,940
it happened totally organically like our

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,919
AV team and production team was like oh

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,940
we should we should stream these we

00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,039
should put them everywhere on the

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,230
internet we should record them and they

00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,970
have been amazing ever since then that

00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,650
the team is formed organically because I

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,130
think everyone on that team really cares

00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:30,360
about the purpose or the goal and

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:33,480
whether or not everyone in github cares

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,950
i can't really be sure but my friend

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,539
chrissy tells me that there was a github

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,739
before passion projects and there was a

00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:42,330
github after

00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:46,239
I'm really in a back that's right cool

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:48,580
so um so anyway so I had nailed down a

00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:50,950
few speakers and real like you know real

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,509
real life so that I wouldn't come up

00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:58,409
empty-handed if the boxes never made

00:26:52,509 --> 00:27:01,479
their way to all be in invitees and I

00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:06,879
need to go back to my notes ok cool and

00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:10,179
then the website ah so since then here's

00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:13,779
my rob lub we've done seven talks we

00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:15,340
received 53 speaker suggestions we've

00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:18,460
been covered in a ton of press of

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,749
venture be Forbes Business Insider but I

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,409
think the thing I'm most excited about

00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:24,940
is like this is my Caine's Arcade like

00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:27,729
it's an avenue to meet incredible women

00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:30,009
and to see them meet other incredible

00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:31,809
women and I hope I get to see that grill

00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:34,109
a lot and I want to recreate that in

00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:37,330
other places not just an Francisco I

00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:40,179
can't really measure those things but a

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,669
really great tangible byproducts is that

00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:44,559
I get to hire women like women to run

00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:47,019
the event so I hire all female

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,159
photographers um Jessica the past

00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:52,479
speaker does khahesh designed our logo

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,889
the websites completely designed and

00:27:52,479 --> 00:28:00,279
built by a woman me um I count right um

00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:02,710
and I ask I only ask the ladies to

00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:04,690
collaborate on all of the blog posts

00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,399
with me and asking the events because I

00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,830
think their opinion they hold a little

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,019
weight there there's a lot of

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:14,710
satisfaction and creating more jobs for

00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:16,629
fantastic woman so if you've ignored me

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,950
this whole time here are the things you

00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:24,580
need to know there's only three of them

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:25,840
try to focus on the positive list so

00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,210
let's say you know I have that one

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,759
really negative situation over here this

00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:33,749
is my cons list of life this is the

00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:36,519
making my life hell and then here are

00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:39,249
usually a ton of people literally

00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:41,109
assaulting me with kindness doing

00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:43,539
amazing things for me supporting me

00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:45,249
showing up to pack moving mark Otto gets

00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:48,129
up and moves furniture for me before

00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:50,019
passion projects like I don't know I I

00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:51,130
think we spend too much time focusing on

00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,960
the small problem

00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:55,150
and giving them too much attention I

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,650
wish we'd focus more of that on the

00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:00,460
positive parts of our lives and how to

00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:03,850
grow and sustain that the next day is if

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:07,420
you went to XOXO fest the first know

00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,460
anyone cool so Dan Harmon gave a really

00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,900
interesting talk i hear but i really

00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:15,250
liked what he had to say about building

00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,810
communities and his uh his i think the

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,780
quote was you could correct me Willow if

00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,670
I was wrong it's stand on roof stand on

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:28,960
the rooftops and shout until you find

00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:30,880
your people that just that like that's

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,340
amazing this is me standing on top of a

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,770
roof top and shouting and I've gotten to

00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,290
meet so many amazing women and connected

00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,660
them with other amazing women and it

00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:42,760
really is like my cane skirt arcade like

00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,320
I sit there every before every talk and

00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,950
I'm just have this big smile on my face

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,270
it's pretty amazing um and be a White

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,670
House said the last speaker Leslie

00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:54,430
Bradshaw really really dovin on this

00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:56,920
concept of like whatever you believe in

00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,540
be that be that lighthouse for other

00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,830
people like you and it's similar to what

00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:04,270
Dan Harmon's had to say about you know

00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,230
screaming on top of a roof top I don't

00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,650
know how to like gesture that

00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:10,480
appropriately but be the lighthouse for

00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,580
people like you make more room for them

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,990
make more space for them it's incredibly

00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,480
important and I think it's up to all of

00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,250
us to be lighthouses and also if other

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,350
people don't like it them they

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:24,360
don't have to live with who you become

00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,360
you have to live with who you become

00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,070
