list Megan Dean so I built bike frames

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,220
um everything I do is custom I don't

00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,330
know how many people were here for three

00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:01,250
or four I can't believe it's been only a

00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,290
year since the first time I spoke

00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:08,090
because it feels like it's been a year

00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:10,899
since six months ago um but so I feel

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:14,509
like my collapse talk was last time I

00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:17,240
basically came here from just moving out

00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:19,340
of Los Angeles quitting my job ending a

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,649
six year long relationship last time and

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,179
so now I've spent the entire summer kind

00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:27,979
of trying to figure out what in the [ __ ]

00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:29,569
I'm doing with my life um I've just been

00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,069
letting things kind of happen I tried to

00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:33,429
move to oakland and buy a bike shop with

00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:36,380
someone that fell apart real real easily

00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:38,299
and it just happened that two months ago

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,280
i had a friend that said you want to

00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:43,219
move to colorado i have space plays for

00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,549
you to work and so i moved my [ __ ] to

00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:49,189
colorado three days ago and now live in

00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,810
boulder colorado but have spent less

00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:52,810
than 24 hours there since i moved

00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:59,509
basically what i've been up to all

00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:00,979
summer is when i quit my day job i was

00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:03,590
in a position where i was really behind

00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,999
on work like things going wrong in my

00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,310
relationship things going wrong at work

00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,200
like everything was a big [ __ ] so

00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,349
i fixed it all pretty much this summer

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,549
and I've kind of tried to figure out

00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:15,110
frame builders have this problem where

00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,760
they're perpetually broke they're always

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,019
like struggling there's

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,939
always you know problem after problem

00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:22,519
everyone's always late on their orders

00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:25,280
you know it's just this industry that

00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,340
attracts people like me who are really

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:33,349
bad at business and really bad with time

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:35,840
management so in an effort to sort that

00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:38,060
out I've actually brought on a friend of

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,370
mine who has helped me we're setting up

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,890
a production schedule where he's helping

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,909
me with do orders on bike parts he

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:48,769
sorted out you know I'm turning over my

00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,720
website to him shortly as soon as

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,069
possible because you know I haven't

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,459
updated it and probably a year no one

00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:58,069
knows where I live things like that so

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,500
we're working out a situation to like

00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,329
basically not keep making the same

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,180
mistakes at every other custom frame

00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:06,680
builder has made for the last 30 years

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,400
because I don't want to be 45 years old

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,250
and crippled and poor and I'm already 30

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,599
and somewhat crippled and poor so I'm

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,680
not really starting out in a good place

00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:21,109
but uh so along with that and along with

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,530
trying to figure out you know what where

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:26,060
my life need to go to go and what was

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,910
going to happen next with frame building

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,519
and racing and I've you know quit racing

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,319
last year unintentionally just just from

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,169
being overworked and overstressed and

00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,599
whatnot so I started an all vegan race

00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:41,030
team this coming year so 2014 we're

00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:44,480
launching a new team that's kind of an

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,299
national group of people really low-key

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,549
just kind of good racers but mostly an

00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:53,120
emphasis on funds so it's just kind of

00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:55,699
been a summer of rather than collapse

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,799
like trying to fix what happened after

00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:02,470
the collapse of everything that I knew

00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,470
so next

00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:20,989
what is your all vegan race team called

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:24,030
sloth attack sloth attack and if you

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:27,389
aside from hiring a friend like be the

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,100
suit basically what would help your

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:33,810
business be the business you want it to

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,949
be like are you missing me besides

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,780
someone just handing me money to

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:40,199
bankroll it for a little while I mean

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,820
would that do it uh they're not not

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:47,580
entirely I mean you know it would take

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:49,169
some of the stress wish I could probably

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,080
spend another five thousand dollars in

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,479
equipment that would roll things along a

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,820
little bit easier and you would make

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:03,750
more bikes faster if you had that

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:06,750
equipment yes okay so that was your your

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:11,130
