Mitch artman spoke at the second

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,320
farmhouse cough and I met him a few

00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:21,109
months ago at Burning Man on the desert

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:24,529
in the desert on or on yahoo in young at

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:26,810
center camp on the playa at the fly of

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:27,679
the playa it was my first time going to

00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,839
Burning Man and it was sort of

00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,810
everything you expect it was and also

00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,850
sort of everything else and I just I

00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,690
took a bag of avocados and gave him

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:42,200
strangers not unlike every day here

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,760
Mitch was another those random

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,710
connections my friend Scott by Ben was

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,290
in town right before farm else come to

00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,880
us we're scrambling everyone's schedules

00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,980
weren't lining up and then he was like

00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,710
oh there's this guy mumble mumble Mitch

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,360
I was like okay sure and a mitch has

00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,680
turned out to be like an institution at

00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,860
farm house cause he's come back every

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,420
time and giving us wonderful crazy

00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:14,960
stories of life in Skid Row Mitch

00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:17,570
Hartman I know the intro to my speech

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,090
the moment I found out the date welcome

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,689
everyone to the 22nd anniversary of my

00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,689
bar mitzvah

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,170
medically attended by a man with a

00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,020
Chewbacca now so we won't do this in

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,880
Hebrew I'm here because she asked me

00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,940
originally because I'm a social worker

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,350
in Skid Row which is to my knowledge the

00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,380
biggest concentration of homeless people

00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,090
in the US and that mental illness in the

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,420
US which is basically what i do

00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,400
homelessness and mental illness so I was

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,860
thinking how do I overlap Skid Row and

00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,930
collapse because in a certain sense Skid

00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,330
Row has collapsed and it's more about

00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,070
the rejuvenation parts no and then I

00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:01,360
thought okay I know exactly what I'm

00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:03,880
going to do so I'm 35 almost figure you

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,160
know if I live normally I'll have 50

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,869
years left people in the crowd are about

00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,640
my age or younger most of you are not

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,980
Jewish you have a better life expectancy

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,739
than I do so everybody here is a decent

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,270
shot at seeing the next 40 to 50 years

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,440
so some current trends and some future

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,320
trends and then I'm going to relate this

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,410
back to skid row and what this has to do

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,440
with collapse current trends going on in

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,239
the world in the last 12 our Mitzvah

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,790
right so the last 13 years since 2000

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,560
bush administration's severe severe

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,820
severe concentration of wealth unlike

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,549
anything really ever seen in this

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,580
country everybody who's losing their

00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:42,310
homes that money is going upwards false

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,320
flag attack with 911 to oil wars we're

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,700
already having wars over resources that

00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,700
are going away public population this is

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,350
not as fun as other talks it's okay the

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,480
public population that has ceased even

00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,769
remotely pretending to think you know we

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,910
go two wars for weapons of mass

00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:02,019
destruction that just just just where

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,299
the are they they were never

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,130
anywhere and no one ever gets mad why

00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:07,780
where is the storming of the Bastille

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,970
where is the flipping over of cars where

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,280
where is our anger it's nowhere to be

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,380
found so the government can go to war

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,360
for very very very very very blatantly

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,650
faked reasons and you know there are a

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,700
few protests but it doesn't stop

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:25,030
anything I finished writing this maybe

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,019
three minutes ago our economy if it's I

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,820
mean it's been like this for a long time

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,160
but our economy has been very very very

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,110
clearly shown to be basically a Ponzi

00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,459
scheme and it collapses every several

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,330
years and then they inject more money

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,520
and a non sustained

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,950
fashion so the false ecology of the

00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,570
economy and the biological ecology that

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,740
we live in are both being non

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:46,330
sustainably destroyed and you also have

00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,100
the government very blatantly defying

00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,020
the Bill of Rights so not like secret

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,850
 you find out but you know the

00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,740
government's like yeah hey Devon I read

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,230
your emails I mean I do any emails me

00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,810
but so does everyone else now right and

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,850
we read your texts and we spy on you you

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,990
know if this is what they tell you I

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,360
mean ordered what are the things they're

00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,950
not telling you right so these are

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,480
current trends which are much better

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,120
than the future trends so seeing a

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,800
future trend some future trends one

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,870
we're not going to have oil we've

00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,090
already had peak oil in 50 years oil is

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,170
going to cost what fifty a hundred three

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,989
hundred five hundred dollars a gallon

00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,220
there's not going to be oil only half of

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,380
the oil that taken out of the ground

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,720
turns into gasoline which means we won't

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,010
have cars and and you know in the long

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,880
term that's probably good but in the

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,680
short term when you don't have an

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,300
infrastructure that's bad that's a

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,400
civilizational collapse the economy

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,470
collapses everybody's retirement account

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,580
goes away the 2008 financial collapse

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,250
will be like nothing that was an

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,750
exception this is going to be the rule

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,400
the other fifty percent of oil gets

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,090
turned into plastic which is really

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,380
crucial for industry and computers so

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,660
that's another tool that people will be

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,280
less able to rely upon in the future to

00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,770
solve the problems that we have now and

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,730
oil is also used for fertilizer and I

00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,169
know a lot of people will say that's

00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,730
great I'm so glad you know there's some

00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,380
vegetables growing over there right

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,760
there's some avocados growing here and

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,070
in the long term that's probably good

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,240
but in the short term it's very bad when

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,440
you don't have an infrastructure to

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,820
replace it you end up having mass

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,530
starvation and finally I was thinking

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,970
and this might seem nightmarish but I

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,500
don't know is it so unrealistic I was

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,490
thinking about drones will be like in 50

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,229
years when the government starts

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,760
cracking down on people because once

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,020
there's the civilization and economy

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,520
start to collapse the government really

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,260
starts to kick up what it's doing right

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,610
it can start saying well I'm spying on

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,080
you right because now we have wars so

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,490
the more Wars you have the more the

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,510
government can do to you and I was

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,830
thinking drones instead of being like

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,510
planes would be almost like sort of

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,979
mechanical birds that this may seem

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,140
unrealistic but there are already little

00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,880
mechanical mosquitoes that can go around

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,169
and get blood samples from people and if

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,750
you don't believe me look it up it's not

00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:42,910
paranoia it's true this is what exists

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,289
now little drone mosquitoes that can go

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,690
around getting blood samples from people

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,750
no it's real so that's your

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,400
government hard at work

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,290
and I was thinking of the future like a

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,300
very scary 1984 future where you'll have

00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,560
like little drone vultures that are just

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,060
going on every city block just kind of

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,710
looking for people who are doing

00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,480
wrong and shooting them when they you

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,740
 wrong and maybe like paralyzing

00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,390
them and like getting out a mass email

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,920
remember that thing a couple months ago

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,180
and everyone who had an iphone got an

00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,040
email from the government was like a tax

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,810
and it was like ostensibly like a

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,390
missing kid or something like nice

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,650
that's like the cover to make it look

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,760
like what it isn't which is the

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,830
government is trying to see if they can

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,660
link start to control everyone or send

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,860
information to everyone immediately such

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,900
as hey there's going to be lynching in

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,150
three minutes on sunset and gower or

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,610
something you know so I think that these

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,460
kinds of bad things may happen and then

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,470
I was thinking okay there may have more

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,940
microchipping of people who might have

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,530
electric more electrical stimulation of

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,850
the brain to control people you can read

00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,950
up on Juan del Gado who's doing this

00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,140
stuff 60 years ago he would put an

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,550
electrode in a bull's brain and he was

00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,780
just we had a radio transmitter that

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,160
controlled it and he would put the

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,630
electrode in the Bulls fear Center and

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,890
he'd let the bull charge him and he had

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,570
no defense and on the bull would get

00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,010
near him he would hit the remote control

00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,050
and the bull would just cower away from

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,070
him that's 60 year old technology I mean

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,870
I'm just sort of curious what they were

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:58,010
doing now anyway so that's all the

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,870
negative stuff and I was thinking so how

00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,760
does this relate to skid row and I

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,440
realized that in the future our lives

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,979
may be a lot more like the way Skid Row

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,510
is now in certain regards and for me I

00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:10,460
want you guys to understand that for me

00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,500
Skid Row is the holiest most beautiful

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,419
part of Los Angeles not to the eye but

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,919
to the heart for me it's the most

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,160
beautiful place and I'm so grateful I go

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,810
there almost every day so in addition to

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,660
being a place of mental illness and

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,210
poverty and drugs and filth and violence

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,919
and all kinds of things it's also a

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,900
place of love it's a place of healing

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,130
it's a place of hearing and I was

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,630
thinking about the community values

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,890
there that skid row maybe teaching us

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,970
because I've been thinking about I've

00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,650
been there only two years but it's

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,090
really sort of rewired my brain about

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,500
the way I think about things that would

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,200
ostensibly have nothing to do is get a

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,810
row am I good with one more minute and

00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,130
go ahead so I was thinking well what

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,200
goes on there there's a lot more

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,580
community sharing both in terms of

00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,140
sharing emotions when people speak in

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,669
groups there's a lot more time spent

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,720
outside of your home people are not

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:55,280
typically on their phones all the time

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,520
there it's not that it doesn't happen

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,819
but it's not like

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,180
and but he's doing something important

00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:05,740
it's okay there's a there's more

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,169
communal housing we may start living

00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,460
more community in so sometimes I help

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,050
people get housed and then they tell me

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,789
about the stuff that goes on in the

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,400
housing agencies where they are so that

00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:17,680
in their own housing there's therapy and

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,530
yoga i would like therapy yoga i'll do

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,849
you do those things so there may be more

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,159
resources pooled in terms of

00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:26,949
human-to-human interaction which may be

00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,509
helpful there may be more compassion

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,860
there may be more senior neighbors

00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,380
problems as your own because i think

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,669
even when things like you know well you

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,440
know the government's bombing Iraq it's

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,789
not mean or you know those people are

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,620
losing their houses but I'm paying my

00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,180
rent it you know the government's

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,860
reading Devon's email but you know I

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,240
don't care about Mike you know it's

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,560
always like it's okay when it happens to

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,880
other people you know that I mean even

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,350
you know I'm a social work on Skid Row

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,360
but I have an apartment I have a dog I'd

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,250
health insurance so it's like I care but

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,230
I would care more if it was me that's

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,790
just reality I try to care as though it

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,170
were me and I get as close as i can but

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,000
its asymptotic you get really really

00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,440
really close with compassion but it's

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
really hard to love people as much as

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,589
you love yourself if you ever get there

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,220
you know please teach me I'm trying to

00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:08,500
get there myself so I think seeing

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,200
others as problem as our own is crucial

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,060
and I think that's one of the key issues

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,950
there I think when a collapse finally

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,180
does happen civilization Lee we're going

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,399
to start recognizing that everyone's

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,810
problem is our own right I think that's

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,980
the beat the big issue you know it's

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,230
kind of like when the Nazis were coming

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,700
up well it's this abatement oh it's

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,170
Czechoslovakia well it's Austria well

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,459
you know eventually it is your problem

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,540
eventually does your problem and

00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,920
everyone likes to wait until it's their

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,110
problem and one day when the middle

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,610
class is living with very low standards

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,779
then everyone will care about the

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,730
collapse and right now we still have

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,170
cars we still have internet you don't

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,420
really fuel the government watching you

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,490
just kind of know what's happening but

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,810
you know I put stuff on Facebook about

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,339
what I think of the government is and i

00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,779
always think I know someone's reading

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:48,130
this you know if you ever put

00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,480
something on Facebook about how you

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,130
think the government is corrupt or

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,570
spying on you were killing people and

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,070
not telling you about it someone's

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,420
reading that it's a computer at

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,070
first and the NSA that's reading your

00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,300
things and then sending it to someone

00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,470
else who's reading it and we putting on

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,950
a loop you know whatever it is they're

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,650
doing what they're doing something with

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,540
and so far they kind of know how to keep

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,760
the fascism very kind of soft and gentle

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,190
it's sort of like 1984 for the foreign

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,990
countries and brave new world here here

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,610
it's all like gentle so it's okay but

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,020
eventually the gentleness is going to go

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,720
away and what we're doing to everyone

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,630
else will come home so at that point I

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,770
want it to close with two things one we

00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,880
should remember the most important

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,210
lesson I've ever learned from Skid Row

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,280
which is that hope continues okay and

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,870
hope in love will always continue and

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,400
hope and love are not just emotions if

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,410
they're just emotions they eventually

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,030
falter you eventually feel despair you

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,160
eventually feel like and you want

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,210
to give up but hope and blood or

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,860
something that are much stronger than

00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,380
just the emotions we associate with them

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,340
they're actually a life force and that's

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,900
going to keep going no matter what

00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,100
collapses so the collapse is on the

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,750
outside but it doesn't have to reach

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,240
inside the ripple effects can stop right

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,490
here the collapse does not need to enter

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,470
your heart and the second thing is that

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,820
just as we're speaking of a future you

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,260
know in 50 years which will have much

00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,700
more change in the last 50 which had

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,920
much more change in the previous 50 and

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,120
so on this future however turns out

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,470
whether it's great and Rosie like

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,850
reycarts file and others think or

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,710
whether it's really bad like I think or

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,860
whatever it is that future will have a

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,210
future and that future of the future

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,530
will probably be as different as

00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,270
whatever it is we're anticipating now

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:17,000
and so I hope that as we move forward

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,890
and you know when we're old we see some

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,200
bad things likely happening you're going

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,970
to hold space for this too shall pass

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,190
for the concept that whatever it is

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,690
that's coming is just going to give way

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,300
to something else as well so that's why

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,130
I really like that the person who said

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,230
you know it's not khalaqa all collapses

00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,190
this is a transition I also remember

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,020
what changed it to me when we bumped

00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,550
into burning man each other in Burning

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,960
Man which you should all go to use talk

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,760
about these runners in Africa and they

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,080
run in this very unique way went on and

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,060
on pretending this is fascinating and

00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,740
you said they run in a certain way where

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,270
it's all a controlled collapse and

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,530
that's how they can be very efficient

00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,420
with their energy and just keep going

00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,860
and so I'm going to put back at shame

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,720
and say that's it's brilliant you know

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,550
and maybe we're going to have a collapse

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,840
and even though it's systemic and even

00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,760
though it's really gonna engage the

00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,530
suffering and death on untold scales

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,640
maybe in a way it is a controlled

00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,579
collapse and maybe it will lead to

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,639
something better thank you

00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:06,639
you

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,380
