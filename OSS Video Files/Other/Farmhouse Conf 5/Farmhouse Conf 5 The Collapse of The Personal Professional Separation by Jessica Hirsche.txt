next speaker is Jessica HISHE she is a

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:16,610
mid-level manager at a regional box

00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:20,630
company she has the claim to fame that

00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:23,210
her grandma grandmother claimed to have

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,870
I believe this invented the corrugated

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,540
part of corrugated cardboard but her

00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,270
sort of greedy manager at the time filed

00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,160
the patent so the hitch family isn't you

00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,699
know she's not an heir to the the

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,160
corrugated cardboard fortune she's just

00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:48,980

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,430
fair I need to go to more of those and

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,099
also I have a fun MailChimp story too

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,200
since there's a mailchimp for the room I

00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,690
worked on the rebranding for mailchimp

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,510
and they were absolutely wonderful to

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,340
work with and they like ruined me on a

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,569
couple other projects because I like

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,099
worked for a couple other companies

00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,540
afterwards and I was like this will be

00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:14,470
amazing in collaborative just like

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,319
MailChimp nope totally [ __ ] and also a

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,660
person wrote me that I like sort of like

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,370
no just through friends this woman

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,230
Hillary and she was like Jessica I know

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,019
that you have contacts at MailChimp I'm

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,060
doing this really weird specific art

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,709
lecture talk thing do you think that you

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,450
could hook me up with someone that would

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,099
help sponsor it and I was like I don't

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,959
want to be put aside you know I don't

00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,209
have sponsorship people and I only have

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,879
the creative directors email so i just

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,049
wrote her back and i bcc'd the creative

00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,849
director that i worked with and I was

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,829
like hey you know it's great to hear

00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:46,600
from you I can't straight-up send you

00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:48,819
their name because I would feel weird if

00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,489
like someone sent my name when

00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:53,680
someone was asking me for money but I

00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,790
just bcc'd him like well maybe if they

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,530
think it's a good match they'll just get

00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,329
in touch and she emailed me like two

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,099
weeks later and was like so they never

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,780
contacted me but I just got a random

00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,120
donation of five thousand dollars for

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,170
mailchimp so that was awesome so I have

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,099
to say so I I like what I am into

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,569
talking about I should probably set a

00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:13,359
timer because I'm a really good Rambler

00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:17,400
um you got it okay cool so you just yell

00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:20,769
at me when I'm talking too much um so ah

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,539
so like the topic of like everybody has

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,099
been having such awesome talks today and

00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,599
they're hit like a little on the like

00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:27,550
end of the world pessimistic side sub

00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,930
dives and I was like [ __ ] how was my

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,370
talking to even fit into this because

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,680
I'm like the most world's most

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,530
optimistic person in the whole planet um

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,750
so and the word collapse was like really

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,180
hard to work a talk around because i

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,009
have not had much i mean i have had

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,349
collapses happen in my life because

00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,669
there's no one that doesn't but I feel

00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:47,380
like I'm one of those people that is

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,699
like I'm like a spinner I like I'm like

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,789
oh well that was really helpful for me

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:53,440
to have that horrible thing happen um so

00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:54,580
I was like what kind of collapsed am I

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,509
going to talk about because everything's

00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,610
[ __ ] roses right now and then so I

00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:02,650
the thing that I really wanted to talk

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,599
about is sort of the collapse of like

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,849
the personal professional life

00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:08,409
separation and I know that some folks

00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:10,659
earlier we're talking about like oh

00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:12,190
there's these privacy services that you

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:13,900
have had to have paid for so that nobody

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,120
can get your nonsense about the NSA is

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,430
in sniping your [ __ ] all the time and I

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,639
am I am like kind of a believer in that

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,699
the more open you are the less people

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,500
are likely to steal from you who here

00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,889
had a horrible rumor started about them

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,110
in high school a couple people how many

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,990
of those people would you sit like of

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,490
all the people that raised their hand

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,530
how many would consider yourselves like

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,639
a like a complete open book everyone

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,610
knew all your seek out of your

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:46,870
everything about you in high school like

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,449
just like one or two right oh that

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:53,009
should be fun

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:54,870
um so I I was always liked old like Oh

00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,400
mystery is important like you know you

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,620
don't want to be saying everything to

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,139
the world or whatever and I always found

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,879
that like people are really interested

00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,319
in your [ __ ] if you're not telling them

00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,259
anything about yourself and they will

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,059
make stuff of value and so I had a

00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,589
couple of really serious awful times

00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:13,229
like that in high school in which people

00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,419
were you know I wasn't being forthcoming

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:16,889
about my private life because I didn't

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,330
feel like I had two and because of that

00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,159
people would make assumptions about what

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,810
was happening in my private life and so

00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,120
that's a great time for that to happen

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,039
right when you're 14 and like everything

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,229
is awful to begin with because people

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:32,009
are terrible between the ages of like 13

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:34,379
and 20 um just just bad people just bad

00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:36,469
people and i get i gave a talk one time

00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:39,210
to a bunch of art school students and

00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:40,710
like the whole thing was just about like

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,060
how art school is the most amazing time

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,039
in your life and that you should be like

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,110
love and every second of it but i

00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,149
started the big part of the talk of like

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,399
man you know like we're all so horrible

00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:51,899
were teenagers right and like and or

00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,520
even like when you're 22 you're like

00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,050
doing all this [ __ ] like i did [ __ ] when

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,789
I was a teenager that like my mom

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,199
reminds me of now like she gave she like

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:00,330
saved up all this money and like bought

00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,129
me this like gold anklet or something

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,819
because it was like 1996 and that's what

00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:07,740
people bought um and I was like mom I

00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,899
don't wear yellow gold I only wear a

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,749
white gold and the sushi regain me that

00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,279
gift when I was like 27 and was like I

00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:15,719
was like hey this is what you said to me

00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:21,479
then cuz you were a dick and I like you

00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:23,459
now so and but I feel like it's just so

00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,439
anyway I'll long story short it was a

00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:26,819
really crazy time in my life and one of

00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,099
the things that was the craziest is that

00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,740
I kept being told by my family over and

00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:33,509
over again that the [ __ ] that was going

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,719
down with them was a secret between us

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:38,520
and so I couldn't tell anyone about any

00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:41,459
of the [ __ ] in my life and it built up

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,319
so much stress so then finally when I

00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,240
got off to college and I felt

00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,789
independent from that situation I felt

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,999
like I wasn't beholden to all this drama

00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:53,249
that was happening all the time I just

00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:55,800
fell in love with every single person

00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:57,599
around me so I'm like I like get super

00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,969
emotional I'm like a mega emotive person

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,310
so if I get all weird like forgive me or

00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:03,290
hug me later or whatever

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,970
um I'm also getting over a really bad

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,110
cold so it might just all be sinus

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,540
problems but we could blame it on

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,520
whatever and so when I got to college

00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,410
and I saw that they were just like I

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,390
just couldn't believe how many amazing

00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,640
people there were in the world like

00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,830
everyone was just so like understanding

00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,390
and human and what and I got really

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,660
interested in every single person's

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,640
story um to the point where I was like

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,590
why don't why I like just want to tell

00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,270
every stranger that I meet that I think

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,400
is an awesome person everything about me

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,600
right I just like feel like I don't want

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,950
to hold anything back I don't want to

00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,630
have this like pool of secrets that I'm

00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,650
not allowed to tell people I just want

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,380
to put it all out there to the whole

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,760
universe and that is it's a scary thing

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,830
to a lot of people to think about not

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,560
having secrets and to just like be open

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,570
about everything that you do and it's

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,280
especially weird to people now like in a

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,840
you know internetting environment it's

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,160
not weird to some people like I'm sure

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,540
anyone who follows me on twitter is like

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,080
those not weird you tell us about all

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:59,960
kinds of [ __ ] um but it's something that

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,430
like wasn't necessarily the thing that

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,830
everybody was doing then especially

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,390
right when I graduated art school there

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,250
was this huge thing of like no one

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,530
operated under their own name you know

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,200
everybody had a cool named studio like

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,790
you know brain sucked design or whatever

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,100
like you know even if it was just you

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,040
you would like make up this weird name

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,690
for yourself like you know and I I knew

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,300
like a ton of my friends from Philly all

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,830
did that and like even if you were the

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,840
only person there you're like our studio

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,610
is a multidisciplinary studio and blah

00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,340
blah blah and I just never had any

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,160
desire to do that in part because i

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,500
started in graphic design but ended up

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,730
becoming an illustrator and illustrators

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,110
just always operate under their name

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,700
because it's very transparent that

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,640
you're the one making the art you know

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,370
like it's not like you know Rome during

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,350
the early papacy we're like it's like a

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,820
person is hiring of millions doing stuff

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,840
for you it's just you sitting there at

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,810
three o'clock in the morning doing your

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,760
work so it was always really easy to me

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,190
to just be me when it came to like

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,590
marketing myself and my art but I didn't

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,650
realize how important it would end up

00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:08,180
being for my career just to do that and

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:10,130
in a lot of different ways so what I

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,170
worked for a woman named Louise feely

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,090
who is like a super old school awesome

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,840
designer in New York she's amazing she

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,520
was like an awesome

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,670
mentor to me when I was first starting

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,100
out but she has she was very clear that

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,320
her studio was Louise feely ltd it is a

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,060
business that is not just her like she

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,490
worked on her own her own name which was

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,080
like relatively rare in terms of like

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,480
everybody else was like pushpin studios

00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,760
or whatever like people were making

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,760
studios under other names but she was

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,560
very very clear that like this is my

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,750
profession it has nothing to do with my

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,430
personal life and I think it just has to

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,500
do with like a generational thing and

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,870
with women in design and she you know

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,190
worked for herb lubalin and you know

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,740
really like ended up being an art

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,720
director at a book publisher and like

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,060
made tens of thousands of book covers

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,650
and it was she was always kind of like

00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,420
an underdog in termine she was always

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,190
had a really lust root of career but

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,800
being a woman in design in New York then

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,230
like a super small portion of people

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,790
were women it was very man centric and

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,740
even now the type world is like still

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:14,120
very boy son trick just as the tech

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:15,560
world is still very boy Cedric but I so

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,420
I thought that I was going to drive her

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,100
[ __ ] crazy by being a person that

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,540
just always was like and this is

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,600
everything that's on my mind you know

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,060
because she controlled the like what her

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,550
studio was so much and like I eventually

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,740
ended up helping with the redesign of

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,120
her site a while ago and like I was like

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,040
you should do a blog you should talk

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,890
about process but she would spend like

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,260
11 days writing like a blog post about

00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,530
like a product that she had launched and

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,570
it just it was very like clean

00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,660
professional marketing speak nothing

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,180
that was personal and I found that like

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,400
that didn't work for me and I just ended

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,200
up having this like epiphany that like

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,510
the more personal my work is the more

00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,370
people pay attention because people are

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:01,040
so obsessed with process and they're so

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,500
into like actually knowing the people

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,620
behind the work and it's especially true

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,640
with type design so free guys that

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,830
aren't familiar with my work I'm a

00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,570
letterer i started in graphic design i

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,660
do lettering and type design and

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,460
illustration sometimes but type design

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,380
is we're they are the people that make

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,910
the fonts so i make font sometimes it's

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,280
like being an engineer it's like being a

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,900
CMS maker basically because you're

00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,970
making a system that can be used by

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,350
endless idiots and they're going to [ __ ]

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,950
with your [ __ ] all the time they're

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,700
going to use it on

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,680
and in in like a computer from 1998 and

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,120
be like i understand i download the zip

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,270
file onto my computer and it's not

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,380
appearing in my font bar um so it's like

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,900
the same [ __ ] that you have to deal with

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,110
in technical ways but one thing that

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,750
font designers have never done is that

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,190
like people that make typefaces form

00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,470
foundries it's the same thing like you

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,910
make this business because what you want

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,260
to do is scare people away from stealing

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,000
from you because you're like I'm a

00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,200
business we have a legal team if you

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,800
steal from us we will come after you

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,180
whatever blah blah blah and but what

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,000
people love to do is to steal from

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,410
businesses so like it's like that's why

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,700
no one gives a [ __ ] about stealing from

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,160
Adobe because Adobe's huge and they're

00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,850
like whatever like who cares like I'm

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,490
not affecting a single person's life so

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,830
what I sort of ended up finding is that

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,880
like plagiarism is a huge issue in a lot

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,620
of different industries and it

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,560
definitely is within like the design and

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,900
type in illustration community but the

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,400
more people feel like they know you the

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,080
less likely they are to steal from you

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,390
so like you're not likely to steal from

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,040
a person that like you feel like you

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,000
have like it is a person like you're not

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,710
going to be like I'm going to take that

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,330
money straight from you even if you hate

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,120
them it's just there's something about

00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,380
it that feels like a key but like you're

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,550
completely fine stealing from a

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,740
corporation so so that that whole thing

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,780
has like really shaped a lot of my

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,790
career and I get endless like internet

00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,230
watchdogs emailing me and being like

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,340
this person's ripping you off or this

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,180
company is using your work illegally

00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:01,220
just because they got to know me and so

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,350
I feel like I'm like ah right now

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,910
because I love talking to people and I

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:11,660
love saying thanks so I'm sorry but um

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:14,870
but anyway so to bring the whole like

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:18,560
the personal versus professional thing

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:21,170
together so I as just like a way for me

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,210
to just say things that are happening in

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,460
my life out loud and I am completely

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,870
unfiltered on there I filter sometimes

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,040
because people don't like to hear people

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,440
that have successful careers complain

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,850
about anything ever so I have to limit

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:37,220
my complaints to things that everyone

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:40,340
else agrees with what you yeah I mean

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,170
it's one of those things but what I have

00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,000
found is

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,709
the community on twitter is just so

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,839
completely amazing and it's made me fall

00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:49,360
so much more in love with humanity than

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,209
I ever would have been before and so I

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,430
and in this so in talking about like

00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:56,620
being more open and how that is so much

00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,170
better for people and their careers or

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,329
people personally is that I found that

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,430
the more open that I am the less likely

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:06,250
i am to like have random stalkers do

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,660
random [ __ ] to me so like I had a

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,720
website called the Internet sends me

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,980
cake in which people would semi cake and

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,230
then I would write a review of their

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,560
cake and I would link to their website

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:19,240
so because what it was is that people

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,579
would write me and they would say like

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,139
Jessica like I have this project that I

00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:25,269
think you should write to Twitter about

00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:26,680
to tell about and I'm like like well you

00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:29,529
know a lot of people do that and I don't

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,120
know you and I feel like what I don't

00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,490
want to do is judge people entirely

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,199
based in their portfolios so I'm I was

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,279
in a studio in Brooklyn at the time and

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,600
I was like wouldn't it be funny if you

00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,269
could only judge people based on the

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,070
cakes that they made and so I started

00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,899
this side internet sends me cake and I

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,480
got so much [ __ ] cake it was crazy

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,519
and everyone was like aren't you worried

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,810
about some stranger poisoning you and I

00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,399
was like well that would ruin the whole

00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,470
thing because I would write about them

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,709
poisoning me so that would be bad for

00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:00,040
them it would be bad for everybody um so

00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:02,140
I do i do like a lot of like random

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,269
[ __ ] like that that's like to I I do

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,130
a lot of like go to a bar in another

00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:07,510
country and just write to the Internet

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,459
and be like hey I'm at this bar come

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,470
hang out and like everyone's so afraid

00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:13,990
of personal interaction they're so

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,459
afraid to misstep and be weird that like

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,529
I only get a couple of them but the

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,540
couple that I get are so awesome and

00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:21,100
I've met so many amazing people by just

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,010
like going out of my comfort zone and

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,990
doing that and I've also got to

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:28,300
experience so I get to experience all

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,310
tons of amazing like the internet is the

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,500
best place on earth kind of stuff my mom

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:36,490
had a super my mom's amazing she's great

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:39,190
person but um she accidentally ran over

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,589
her cat this year and it was devastating

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,389
like and she is like the crazy person

00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,709
that deals that like feeds all the feral

00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,810
cats in the neighborhood and this was

00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:49,540
like her baby cat that she like hung out

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,800
with every day and she was losing it she

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,410
was leaving me all these like super we

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,390
be messages and couldn't handle it so my

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,010
mom got laid off from her

00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,830
like she has had a really hard time

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,450
being employed since jumping back into

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,089
the employment pool when she was like in

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,530
her 40s after my parents got divorced

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,930
because everyone was like you're overly

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,420
educated we can't give you a job because

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,400
you'll be bored so even though she has a

00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,350
master's degree in organic chemistry she

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,060
was like getting fired from like working

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,950
the estee lauder counter at the mall or

00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,720
like you know would try and work at a

00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:22,000
bank and was having issues like being a

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,579
bank teller and stuff like that and she

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,589
got laid off and it was it just like she

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,880
was in a moment of like super financial

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,610
ruin and I was like well why don't you

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,320
come work for me and you can just I mean

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,240
I don't I will make up a job whatever

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,730
you can do my order fulfillment you can

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,500
check my email whatever so for the past

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,060
couple of years my mom has been like my

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,710
digital secretary so if you've written

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,780
me an email in the last like three years

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,550
my mom has read your email and a lot of

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,410
and a lot of people are like your

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,750
publicist wrote me I don't like this my

00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,840
mom just so you know just say hi you

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:55,240
know but anyway so I've had this like

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,180
really interesting working relationship

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,560
with my mom for a couple of years and

00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,300
she's like the most amazing customer

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,370
service person and people shall be like

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,720
oh my god you're from this part in New

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,160
Jersey I grew up in that part of New

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,230
Jersey when people place orders in my

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,880
store and I thought that it was super

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,260
creepy to do that at first because I was

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,820
like you know people get lots of emails

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,290
I don't know if they want that but most

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,960
people don't get as many emails as we

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,660
get and they get really really excited

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,670
when some random person is like no way

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,440
you went to this place and then they

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,060
have this like little I can look at it

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,460
because in my email and they have this

00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,590
like little exchange and it's beautiful

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,290
so when this really horrible thing

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,580
happened to her and she just like she

00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,650
was having such a hard time just like

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,170
thinking that human beings were cool

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,490
like you know just a really hard time

00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,960
she's having a hard time now with like

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,100
the health care stuff like my mom tried

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,720
to sign up for Obamacare and they

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,980
wouldn't give her a plan that was less

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,510
than twelve hundred dollars a month and

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,130
she makes like twenty thousand dollars a

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,620
year so that doesn't make any sense and

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,600
so I get it like I get all that so I

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,340
wrote every person that has ordered

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,620
something in my store in the last three

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,150
years and I i just sent out an email

00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,460
blast and said hey you know sorry for

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,140
the unsolicited email but you've

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,430
probably if you you're getting this

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,600
email cuz you bought something from me

00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,530
in the last couple of years and if you

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,240
bought something for me the last couple

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,090
of years you've probably had a pleasant

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,950
exchange with a woman named Donna

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,660
who if you didn't know it is my mom well

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,330
she's having like the world's roughest

00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,640
day to day her like beloved cat was

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,290
killed and it's like really just killing

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,970
her and I feel like she's been in a

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,320
rough patch and if you can just send her

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,940
a little note or a little bit of

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,360
kindness it would make such a huge

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,910
difference and sure enough like hundreds

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,370
of emails of like people writing these

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,690
like super like intimate stories about

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,300
their relationship with their pets

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,790
people sent her they like this person

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:42,330
that started a start-up in which they

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:44,070
just send like discarded like animal

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,320
like stuffed animals to people that like

00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,360
are having a bad day like sent her one

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,830
and it was just one of those moments in

00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,110
which like the Internet is [ __ ]

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,210
awesome like it's just amazing so

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,680
anybody that like is really concerned

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,690
about like oh we just need to be like

00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,580
way more tight lived in private like you

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,210
can't have those magic moments if you do

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,890
that but that said I am a really sherry

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,750
person and I made a crazy wedding

00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,580
website when I got married and Gawker

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,550
decided to write a shitty article about

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,560
it and that was kind of awful so many of

00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,330
you people probably aren't super

00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,730
familiar with my work but I made a

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,490
wedding website called Justin rusted us

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,990
which he may have seen and it is the

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,170
story of how me and my husband our

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,760
husband got together and it was I mean I

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,510
had a blast i collaborated with a bunch

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:33,090
of friends to make it it was great and

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,410
thank you thank you and he did all the

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,290
JavaScript work because that's not my

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,940
realm of expertise but I was the

00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,470
creative director on that one I am like

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,600
a like the reason why i'm in this nerd

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,150
world is because i actually like love

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,520
HTML and CSS and PHP stuff and I do it

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,900
all the time and i started this website

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,340
called don't fear the internet with my

00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,120
husband in which we teach HTML CSS

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:55,440
people but anyway so I was really pumped

00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,300
and people were writing me these

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,650
beautiful letters about how touching it

00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,620
was and how they didn't understand that

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,270
like like they were just like I never

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,040
knew that the internet could be this

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,690
like used in this way for storytelling

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,920
and it was awesome and that went on for

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,720
like a month and a half and I was like

00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,610
we're amazing this is so great I love

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,230
everybody you know everyone should get

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,960
married to everybody you know it was one

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,060
of those moments and and it also it was

00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,860
great too because wedding planning was a

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,810
nightmare for me it was horrible because

00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,580
my family had not been in the same room

00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,690
together since I was 14

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,690
and they were calling the police on each

00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,430
other so like people were having calling

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,440
me selfish and saying I wasn't planning

00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:34,020
around them as family members do and

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,610
when all things were happening and so it

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,350
was this like beautiful beacon of light

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,430
in the middle of like stupid family

00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:43,650
nonsense and then Gawker was like were

00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:46,290
like world's most hipster website makes

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:49,340
us wanna outlaw love it's like to wes

00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:52,380
anderson movies [ __ ] each other and

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,210
which which i thought was really funny

00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,030
because they had no idea that i had

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,460
actually worked for wes anderson so like

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,470
I did the tie to the titles for moonrise

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,820
kingdom and like I had just gotten done

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,250
working with him and I was like they

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,990
must know that that and they did not so

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,370
it was really funny so they just thought

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,600
they had stumbled across this random

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,400
website on the internet that they wanted

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,430
to [ __ ] on and they like head like so

00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,620
they posted this and most of it was just

00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,480
like Gawker satire you know like normal

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,500
normal [ __ ] and of course the commenters

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,540
were like the worst people on earth

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,090
because Gawker commenters are like

00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,560
amazing writers and also like relatively

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,120
smart so they say all the things that

00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,490
you say in your head like when you're

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,660
having a bad day like they're like this

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,490
stuff I think this is the most

00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,320
narcissistic person I've ever seen in my

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:38,790
entire life [ __ ] her and [ __ ] her love

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,860
you know like and and they like they got

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,140
really really intense and like we're

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,460
calling Russ ugly and we're saying you

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,410
know and all that you know like just

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,620
super crazy and of course my mom reads

00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,210
my emails so so she sees all these

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,890
people writing me black I'm so sorry

00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,940
about the car thing you're awesome don't

00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,400
worry about it of course my moms like

00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,130
what's this car thing about oh you know

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,900
starts reading everything she's texting

00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,490
me being like Jessica know that you

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,310
don't want me to leave a comment but I

00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:07,260
really want to you know I'm like don't

00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:12,480
jump into the snake pit mom don't do it

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:14,220
and both but then then after that after

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,110
it was all terrible and I'm also like to

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,790
like the [ __ ] nerds like I love you

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,560
guys but there's there's like a group of

00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:23,280
nerds that are just vengeful and awful

00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,630
and so occasionally I get like a very

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,370
kind-hearted email from someone that's

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,710
like Jessica I was just over on hacker

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,450
news and i saw this really misogynistic

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,490
thread about you I feel like you should

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,990
go and say something and I'm like that's

00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,390
the opposite of what anyone should ever

00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,820
do and you know

00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:42,150
just do not do that just you know

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:46,890
whatever just ignore it it goes away let

00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:49,260
them hate everything and so anyway so my

00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,790
mom was all upset and then my dad like

00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,230
had a meltdown because my dad does not

00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,150
understand how the internet works like

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,760
if his browser does not open to yahoo he

00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:58,560
thinks the internet is broken um unlike

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,990
unlike my mom is like super with it

00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,090
she's like you know any time that I get

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,010
those random solicitation emails like

00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,690
check out this new cool startup II

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,940
website thing in which you can buy stuff

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,470
an hour before everyone else she signs

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,870
up immediately and then I see her

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,370
facebook like I can I can tell that

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,310
she's just going with all every single

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,470
spammy like new service that comes into

00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:23,460
my inbox she signs up for so she's like

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:26,790
all in um but my death my dad saw the

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,230
the Gawker things somehow and was like I

00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,990
don't want you to post any pictures of

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,820
me or any of our family from your

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,740
wedding like I don't want to be in the

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,360
video blah blah blah so then as we're

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,190
like doing our wedding stuff like I had

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,610
a videographer completely cut my dad out

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,570
of the video it's like totally weird um

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,750
anyway I to live back around to Gawker

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,460
but so it was awful but it was also sort

00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,600
of awesome in victorious because people

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,450
were writing me and being like [ __ ]

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,640
those guys don't worry and eventually

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,830
what ended up happening is that so many

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,540
people wrote Gawker to call them a dick

00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:01,950
about doing it that they wrote a

00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:05,430
retraction post which is crazy so

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,840
awesome internet also I was trying to be

00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,670
I was trying to take in super light

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,290
because I actually used to read Gawker

00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,420
like crazy when I was in New York and it

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,680
was very New York centric so as soon as

00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,530
they posted the article I was like

00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,600
roasted by Gawker made it you know and I

00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:22,320
put it up I put it on my resume on my

00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,510
website and so even though they were

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,790
talking such serious [ __ ] on me like it

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,290
was crazy I just thought that I am like

00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,570
oh whatever who cares like people that

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,400
know me won't what they won't know um

00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,930
but yeah they ended up writing this

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,850
article that was like Jessica ish is

00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,980
actually a very nice human or something

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,720
and and then of course all the

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,700
commenters like immediately turned on

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,520
the author and was like [ __ ] you sell

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,520
out Dana so is amazing

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:53,269
but anyway um how am i doing on time

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,419
five minutes Oh perfect yeah this was

00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:59,299
great so so it's all just sort of like a

00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:01,340
long way of saying like I what I

00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:02,809
actually really find to be super

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,370
comforting is I hate people that like

00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:08,870
try to like I I see people like gaming

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,519
followers and gaming [ __ ] like that it

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,260
is the most useless thing in the whole

00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,179
universe to just like try to be

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,149
influential without understanding your

00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:19,130
the people that are following you and to

00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:21,799
build a network of people that just like

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,389
appreciate what you do is like the most

00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:25,010
amazing thing in the whole universe and

00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:27,710
then you can just like make magic happen

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,740
like I've I've seen so much [ __ ] of just

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:33,080
like me uniting people that like happen

00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,960
to like I end up being like a little

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,220
super connector between them and so it's

00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,130
just like it's just [ __ ] lovely

00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:43,250
that's all I just [ __ ] lovely um so

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:45,889
anyway I just really like you guys I'm

00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,029
gonna do it I'm feeling good I could

00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:48,980
tell more stories about Internet

00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:52,659
awesomeness but you know everything

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,659
