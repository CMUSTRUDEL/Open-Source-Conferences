Leia silver and I go way back to the

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:16,109
early engine yards she also has

00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:19,130
organized several conference events I

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:23,490
feel like where we have this sort of

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:27,420
kindred spirit of like empathy of like

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,039
I've been there I know it's like you

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,690
know you meet someone who like fought in

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,390
the trenches but different trenches and

00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,550
sort of this and Leia was like Eli was

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,309
saying the first cup i didn't really

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,420
have really any idea that there was

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,769
going to be more than one so it's just

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,879
called farmhouse come it wasn't

00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:47,159
farmhouse comp 1 or 2010 and I didn't

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,799
really have any like pull or like any

00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:54,809
clout or I didn't have any like like

00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,179
reach right so I just called in markers

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,799
from friends and then I kind of tweeted

00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,389
about a little bit and 30 people bought

00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,819
tickets to hang out my backyard for the

00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:04,650
day and Leia was one of those friends I

00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:06,270
was kind enough to come down and I

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,870
believe she SAT and that while she gave

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,760
her a talk totally the this the chairs

00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,820
last time or more I'm sorry first time

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
we're more like focus to the here by the

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,930
way everyone who's standing back there

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,820
there are some derelicts chairs here and

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,310
there and about and we can add more

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,780
seating so you don't stand all day

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:31,080
there's also empty chairs if you're not

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:32,610
afraid of Julia Mae West mackay all

00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,050
kinds of chairs if you want to say it

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,050
but if you want to sit but if you want

00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,890
to stay that's fine too so Leah silber

00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,890
whoo

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,520
so when thinking about coming here I ran

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,990
to the same problem that I ran into last

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,210
time which is that this is really a

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,190
casual fun conference where people tell

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,290
stories and I don't so much have any

00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,729
stories there are a lot of friends in

00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,640
the audience and I'll go out with them

00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:02,049
and Aaron will tell many jokes and Evan

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,270
will argue with you Hooda and they'll

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,799
all buy each other's heads off and I'll

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,380
quietly sit and like divvy up the check

00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,959
so everybody has everything in order so

00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,170
I'm glad that the laughs per minute went

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,610
down but I didn't go back and watch my

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,340
talk from the first conference because

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,050
that would be horrible I have not

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,630
reached a level of comfort where that is

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,300
at all okay but I did sit down and think

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,709
about what do I have a perspective on

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,930
now that I didn't have a perspective on

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:31,209
then and so just to fill in a little bit

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,890
what I talked about back then was open

00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,450
source communities in general and my

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,400
strategies for how to build them how to

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,569
run them how to be a company involved in

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,840
them and all that and I stand by most of

00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:46,480
what I said nowadays smell much what

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,700
much wiser but there are sort of

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,049
different areas that I have shed like

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,090
since that I sort of didn't even realize

00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:54,100
where elements and one of them is what

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,959
I'm sure many of you have talked to have

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,579
heard it's not talk about yourself but

00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,320
which is the the role of even a

00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:02,410
benevolent dictator for life in an open

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,510
source project and basically when you

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,040
have an open source project it's started

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,630
by someone it started by a small group

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,880
of someone's and all the people who sort

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,160
of come along are attracted to something

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,799
that they saw that those people created

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,180
and what people often times forget in

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,340
projects that are not successful is that

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,620
they really had a solid vision at that

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,880
point for what they were creating what

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,890
it was going to contribute how it was

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,829
going to function and it becomes

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:30,160
problematic obviously as a project grows

00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:33,220
to maintain that vision and so you will

00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,190
end up with some sort of leader or small

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,019
group of leaders and there are bad Lee's

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,450
to do it and good ways to do it and

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:42,040
better ways to do it and one of the

00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,359
things that I've gained a lot of

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,620
perspective on though I don't know how

00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:48,700
many of them I could cram into five

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:51,040
minutes is that there yeah it is what

00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,110
some of the right ways to do it are and

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,830
basically also what some of the wrong

00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,240
to do it are but it's important that you

00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,830
maintain the fact that there be people

00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,720
who have the big picture and that

00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,610
doesn't always happen naturally and it's

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,770
something that you have to sort of work

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,170
on and and there's a couple ways to do

00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,840
it and option one is i am the king of my

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,690
project or queen of my project i will

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,190
review all commits i will be in charge

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,870
of all major decisions i will make sure

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,370
that everything passes through me so

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,470
that nothing bad passes through and

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,120
while that in theory makes sense it

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,730
creates a huge bottleneck and really

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,970
stifles the grow through project another

00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,620
option is that you have a small is we're

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,010
sort of climbing the spectrum from

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,780
terrible too I think possibly the best

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,520
thing that I've come across but then

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,500
sort of in the middle of it is you have

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,780
a small group of lieutenants and they

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,240
each have their own sort of little I

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,470
want to call it fiefdom even though that

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,090
obviously in parts that I think that it

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,430
is not the right way to do it but that

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,020
that's how it tends to be and for

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,950
example in rails one of the things that

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:56,230
deej is unwrite is that he has been he

00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,790
has not been okay with okay Erin you

00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,169
were in charge of active record this

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,930
person you were in charge of that right

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:04,419
he sort of insisted that everybody have

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,850
a larger perspective on what's going on

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:09,700
I don't have intimate details of how he

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,490
does this and if it is nice but this is

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,770
the this is the way it happens and then

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,830
the last way to do it which is sort of

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,110
one that I am a fan of is basically you

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,229
still have this small group group not

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,870
person and they maintain this larger

00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:27,550
vision but they have delegation and in

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,520
this group of people to whom they

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,630
delegate there is cross training I guess

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,190
is what I would say it's not like you

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,050
own this you own that you on this and

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,370
many of the private side witness have

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,350
meetings every week and it's sort of

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,610
like I will jump in and talk about some

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,110
of the code even though i'm the

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,660
marketing person but i might talk about

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,979
like how it's affecting my situation

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,260
that the docs don't generate a certain

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:49,240
way and i might jump in and talk about

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,430
some political thing that's going on

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,930
with what gets merged as it relates to a

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,000
conference and the guys amongst

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,320
themselves in the project I'm think of

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
right now there are only guys other than

00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,060
myself and the guys among themselves

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,150
will talk about their different areas

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,729
they will cross boundaries the important

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,039
thing for this group of people

00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:10,379
is that they maintain this big picture

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,559
and the way one of which one of the ways

00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,729
that you really can do this is by having

00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:16,139
you have to actually work hard to have

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,909
this larger perspective I guess is what

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,379
I should say and so one of the projects

00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:22,529
that I work on these days is ember and

00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,629
the people who are in this small group

00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,129
don't just work on ember they work on

00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:27,389
ember they do consulting work they do

00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:30,210
training work they do all these things

00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,949
that sort of allow them to have the

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,050
holistic perspective of everything from

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:37,439
the guy at the bottom who's learning to

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,870
the major company who needs to do XYZ I

00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,610
called I reference the ages porn

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,899
something that's right and one of the

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,849
things that I think he does wrong and

00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:47,339
this is a key point for me because I

00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:49,559
probably didn't realize this four or

00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:52,050
five years ago was that he is a little

00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:53,610
bit to focus on his own personal use

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,379
case and he's been very public about

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,529
saying like if this is not good for base

00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:00,149
camp it is not good for rails or that is

00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:03,889
not a direct quote to be clear but that

00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:06,539
is the sentiment of the quotes and the

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,309
five years ago lay I was working for at

00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,349
the time engine yard and we were sort of

00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:12,599
trying to get our group into the rails

00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:13,979
community in a very positive way we

00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,719
wanted to help you want to do a lot and

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,459
I think the perspective at that point

00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:21,060
was like we really want to own as much

00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:23,009
of this as possible versus nowadays on

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,719
the project that I work on we spend a

00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:28,379
lot of time and effort getting other

00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:31,349
companies to be invested and to also own

00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,639
pieces and parts so not like a core team

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,899
or everybody worked for one company but

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,870
a core team where it might be three or

00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,370
four or five and that feels a little bit

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,080
scary because you're giving up a lot of

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,699
control and to be honest if I had like a

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,349
lot of time to give a talk like this it

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,659
would probably be called something about

00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:47,069
the the role of ego and an open source

00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:48,930
project where it's helpful where it's

00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:51,659
not and sort of tackle it from that

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,499
perspective but the diversification of

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:56,699
the core team of a project is very

00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,870
important to again having that holistic

00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,479
perspective and making sure that you're

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,550
not just like honed in on your use case

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,849
and ignoring other people and I guess

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,860
the i guess the collapse angle is if you

00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:09,839
do though this the wrong way your

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,610
project will collapse and i'm not saying

00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,189
at all that rails will collapse but i

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,719
think that it's a great example of a

00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,669
project that's in a somewhat precarious

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:18,409
position and there are lots of people

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,689
who think that

00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:23,629
not really covering their use cases

00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:26,479
anymore or following the path that they

00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,769
would like it to call and I feel like if

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,319
rails were to fail it would be a

00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:32,599
spectacular collapse it will take lots

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,789
of times but uh but yeah I think there

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,169
are many things that you could do I'm

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,879
specifically right now just talking

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,019
about the like formation of your core

00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,649
team but there are many things that you

00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:44,000
could do to help have a healthy growing

00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:45,860
open source project it's something I

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,959
care about something I do all the time I

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,759
hope in my few minutes I've given you

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,620
something some wisdom worth taking home

00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,220
but I'm happy to talk more about if any

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,220
of you are interested

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,620
