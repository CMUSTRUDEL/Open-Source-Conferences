00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,850

00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:18,949

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,300
still in earshot there you go he and

00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:25,130
Abby made the small human called Zoe

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,109
they went to school down here at SCE

00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,749
that ended up back in Seattle somehow

00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:32,840
and that's where I met him one night at

00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:35,870
Seattle RB and Seattle RB was a very

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,850
like so a ruby meetup but it was really

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,440
just sort of like nerd social hour we

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,710
hung out on a coffee shop and sometimes

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,080
open laptops and I lived him the sort of

00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,930
North her side of town and was like a

00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,320
dark and stormy night or you know sort

00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,820
of gray and Misty night in Seattle and I

00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,160
was like well time to get on you know

00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,960
40-bit minutes more buses and transfer

00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,880
and whatever so I was like I'll Drive

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,100
you home it's totally out of my way it's

00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,339
fine and and that was the beginning of

00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,159
this long relationship of him giving me

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:10,310
rides home and then couch is asleep on

00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,299
and hotel floors to sleep on and now

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,179
they way of kind of just right around

00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:18,499
the corner and Evan and John bender

00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:21,140
where you had John used to sort of co

00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:22,549
squat by my living room office and it

00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,929
was great having the boys around and

00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:27,079
they both went had little humans and

00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:28,369
left me forever so Evan Phoenix and Zoe

00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:35,659
Phoenix are going to give their talk

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:43,249
here we go wouldn't say something to

00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:44,270
start say hello thanks so I was trying

00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:47,509
to figure out what I wanted to talk

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,179
about and I went back and looked at the

00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:51,770
date of the first Pharma's conf which I

00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:58,009
needed to do because I was just curious

00:01:51,770 --> 00:02:00,259
and Zoe was a thing about this size at

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:03,459
the time that would have been may she

00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:07,579
was born in July so she was tiny and

00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:10,429
still in utero at the time and I bring

00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:13,189
that up mostly because so I'll get back

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,720
to that um so that what I talked about

00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:17,970
at the time was

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,140
I open source project and how I had

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:26,610
gotten hired to work on it and and it's

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:29,610
it's sort it's it's funny how sort of

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,250
you know just normal time changes things

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:37,470
and what you want to do and I in in

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:42,330
since then I well okay I didn't think

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:44,370
this all the way through so ah ok I got

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,400
five minutes I can just stumble around

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:51,390
45 minutes thanks so I ended up quitting

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,880
that job and my my dream job at the time

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,910
and it was because I just kind of felt

00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,930
like I had been doing that for five-plus

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,540
years at the time and I Zoe was around

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,850
then she this was about a year and a

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,280
half ago and I kind of had to make a

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,260
decision like did I I'd known it for

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,360
five years which is five years in tech

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,860
is an eternity and did I want to be

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,870
doing it for them to ten years did I

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,250
want to say like I worked on this one

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,950
project for ten years that's all I did

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,940
for ten years that would be kind of

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:28,500
insane and so I ended up just quitting

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:31,080
and okay thanks and so I ended up

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,570
quitting and going off to basically do

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,400
another job and I haven't I sort of sit

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,940
still help out that project I haven't

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,920
really come back to it but I the i bring

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,950
this up and i bring zoe up here because

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,670
I wanted to to keep with the theme if

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:51,330
you will and yeah you're back he's over

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:54,330
there we'll get it in a sec okay yeah

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:56,870
you have to wait that's right yeah

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,870
you're doing a great job

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:05,480
so um so III bring the story up and I

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,120
bring the Zoe up because you know

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,920
there's there's sort of no end thing so

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,990
like you know if there's going to be

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,090
collapsed so if I say that like my job

00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,160
my working on my dream job collapsed

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,109
that was fine that's because there's

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,540
always something after that right so

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:23,630
collapses never an end it's always just

00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,600
a transition if you will right so at

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,130
that time when I first gave this talk I

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,650
felt like I have to do this job forever

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,090
is going to be amazing and I also didn't

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,130
know what it was like to be a dad at the

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,040
time and how much time that would take

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:42,919
up and I'll i know i know bunkie we're

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,750
gonna get back in a sec okay and so I

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,550
you know I I thought it would be a good

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,160
sort of juxtaposition to say like you

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,110

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,180
