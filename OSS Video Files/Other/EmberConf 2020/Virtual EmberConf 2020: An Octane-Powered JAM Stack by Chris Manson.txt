Description: 
	An Octane-Powered JAM Stack by Chris Manson

JAM Stack has become a popular phrase in our industry over the last few years with projects like Gatsby and Vuepress gaining popularity at fantastic speeds. As it is a very new tech stack there is still some innovation that can be added to the mix, and Ember Octane has the power to unlock a whole new generation of JAM Stack developers with the Empress project.

[Music]

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,770
hi everyone my name is Chris and I'm

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,540
here today to talk to you about gem sack

00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,360
if you don't know me already I'm a

00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,360
developer at simple apps and you can

00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,580
always find me on discord or on twitter

00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,280
and if you pretty much did you say

00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,260
anything gem sack related on the ember

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,059
community discord I'll probably pop up

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,530
and want to join in the conversation and

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,070
as I said I'm gonna be talking a little

00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:53,559
bit about Jam stock and I'll give you a

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,799
bit of history but where gem stock comes

00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,449
from what it means then I'll go into a

00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,960
little bit of detail about embers

00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:04,119
position in the jam stack revolution and

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,570
a little bit just a tiny bit on why

00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:11,350
amber octane is potentially a really

00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:13,900
unique selling point for us compared to

00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,150
some of the other jam stock offerings

00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:21,400
out there at the moment I'll go into a

00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:25,840
few projects in ember that are using Jam

00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,700
sack and hopefully show you how you

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,390
might get involved or get started if you

00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,170
wanted to if you're interested so now

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:37,960
it's time to get started but before I do

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,579
a little bit of a issue when talking

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,469
about Jam stack related things is that

00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:48,490
you say Jam a lot during the talks so I

00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:49,929
am going to if anybody wants to give me

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,479
an estimate of how many times I've

00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:55,869
actually said Jam today in this talk if

00:01:52,479 --> 00:02:01,030
you tweet me with your guess that I will

00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:04,060
send the person who's closest a piece of

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,149
swag or something ever related so tweet

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:11,290
me a tree late if you want to

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:14,770
participate if you want to guess and now

00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,470
let's get started so I'll start with

00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:21,760
where jump jam comes from so what

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,850
actually is Jam stack and this quote

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,710
here is actually taken from Jam stop Jam

00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,120
stacked up or work so hopefully it's a

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,980
good definition

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,080
it's actually been updated recently in

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,170
the last kind of two or three months so

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,590
it's actually much easier to understand

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:42,400
now but I'll always like to just so we

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:46,420
can experience it together jump stock is

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,730
fast and secure sites and apps delivered

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,520
by pre-rendering files and serving them

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,370
directly from a CDN removing the

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,239
requirements who manage or run web

00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,950
servers ok interesting good definition

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,170
it's interesting though that doesn't say

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,860
anything with John the old definition

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:08,850
did say Jam and what that actually stood

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,310
for so let's bring that up now so

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:16,810
j-a-a-a-am stands for JavaScript API s--

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:19,540
and markup okay pretty clear

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,870
self-evident no okay

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:26,319
I don't think so anyway this doesn't

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,000
give me a feeling that I know what Jam

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,330
stack actually means from just looking

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,070
at these two things so let's dig into a

00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,820
bit more of the history of it and see if

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:40,030
we can understand it a bit better

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:44,380
John stack is a marketing phrase 100%

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:46,329
created by Napa Phi okay some of you

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,769
might have already known this some of

00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:52,480
you probably see this for the first time

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,890
today and I'm not I don't mind I don't

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,350
think this is a bad thing the only thing

00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:00,010
that makes me think up is respect

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,340
nullify they have gotten so many people

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,049
to talk about Jam stack to keep

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,420
presentations about Jam stack to even

00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:10,739
have entire conferences about it and

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:14,590
that is a very difficult thing to do and

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:17,769
I'm actually thinking about it why never

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:21,010
fie why would they be one of the ones to

00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:23,080
coin a phrase like this so back to the

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,840
definition it said serving sites

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,870
directly from a CDN and that's the

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,280
that's the link that's the key Netta Phi

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:35,540
is essentially a content management

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,220
hosting company

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,220
content management a content delivery

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,010
network hosting company so they are

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:46,430
focusing on serving static assets

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:49,520
quickly all over the world and parts of

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,370
what part of what makes jams acts Jami

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,670
is this idea of not having to manage in

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:58,310
servers as well so I'm not I'm having to

00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,200
maintain it yourself and which plays

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,010
quite well for a company that does

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,720
exactly that sort of CDN hosting and

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,300
slight caveat here as well just a kind

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,880
of an aside you might hear people talk

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,150
about Jam stack as like the service of

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,770
front-end development in the same way

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,380
that the whole service movement doesn't

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,600
actually remove servers it just means

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,450
that somebody else is running them and

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,370
in our case there are servers still

00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,960
running the CDN we're just not hosting

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:32,240
we're not maintaining and so you know

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,680
hear me talk about all this bringing up

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,000
the fact that it's a marketing term only

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,390
you might think I'm a bit of a cynic but

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,890
I'm not I'm already happy with what

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:46,340
never fired doing and I love the jam

00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:49,460
stack and the reason why I'm saying all

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,110
of this that it's mostly marketing it's

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,820
just a much straighter jump stack isn't

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,940
something revolutionary it's not new

00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,770
it's just an evolution of some of the

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,010
stuff that we were already doing as a

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:04,120
community you know building web

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:07,040
applications and giving in a catchy name

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,070
allows us to more easily talk about it

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,200
for us to you know gather around the

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:16,790
term and build things specifically for

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:19,850
this idea and and also you know thinking

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:22,790
of it in these terms also gives us a way

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:26,750
to categorize what apps are or are not

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:29,600
very gem stack so with this history in

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:33,200
our back pockets let's see if we can

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,500
move on to our to my patent-pending jam

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,650
stack classifications is spectrum this

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:42,340
is supposed to be a strawberry jam

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,340
spectrum

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:50,270
my heart still but this starts at the

00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:52,850
empty jam-jar silent spectrum and runs

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:56,540
all the way through the jamyest jam

00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:59,480
donut you can imagine so um my

00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:03,110
developers just building a single page

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:06,290
application or an SP a did you know that

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:09,470
actually we deserve a position on this

00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:12,500
spectrum um with every one of the apps

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,960
that we've already built depending on a

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,400
few things it kind of put us in a

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,550
different position but I'll go into some

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,900
of those details now so let's imagine

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,620
you're building a single page

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:27,380
application we tend to have this idea of

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,300
a separate repo for your front end and

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,250
back end let's just ignore the whole

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,110
mono repo thing pretend that doesn't

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,780
exist for a second so you have these two

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,760
separate repos you can host your front

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,710
end using something that like mattified

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,750
and if your back-end is in this other

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:47,480
repo then you actually end up in a not

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,700
very jammy part of this spectrum because

00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,010
if you think back think back to where

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,590
the term comes from now the five doesn't

00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,440
allow you to do the server hosting now

00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:00,050
you know there's some caveats there you

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,330
could do it as a service functions or

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,220
something like that but even if you are

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,380
using service functions and you are

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,610
maintaining those it's kind of like a

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:12,650
half gem technology anyway so if you

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,530
want to move up this spectrum if you

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:19,550
want to become more of a mint gem

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:21,110
application then one of the best ways to

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,760
do that or one of the first things you

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,680
should do is you should be hitting an

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,890
external API instead of one that you

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,680
maintain one that you write what do I

00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,450
mean by an external API so some things

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,000
that you could do is you could build an

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,550
application that just hits the github

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,410
API directly so it's like maybe a new

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:44,690
dashboard app or something like that

00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:46,460
something custom using github data or if

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,770
you want to build something entirely

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,850
custom something new you could use

00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,949
something like content ville

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,360
and or contentful I don't know how

00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:58,259
you're supposed to say it but it's fine

00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,959
so come tempo is like a CMS as its

00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:04,589
service so CMS is content management

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,300
system and it's pretty cool it means you

00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:09,019
can start an app really quickly and not

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,709
have to worry about hosting the server

00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:16,259
aspect of things and you know if you're

00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:19,470
building your application using some of

00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:22,259
these external api's then I would kind

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:27,269
of put you just shy of the middle of

00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:30,509
this spectrum in the jammie Dodger part

00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:32,699
here so let's imagine we have remember

00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:35,730
app it's using one of these cool

00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:38,100
external api's now what how do we how do

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,399
we become more jamming Harry aim for

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,300
that donut well the first thing that we

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,680
have to look at is server-side rendering

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,579
service our rendering will help us climb

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:53,220
this ladder this Jam ladder and one of

00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:55,319
the things that we need to think about

00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,370
in these terms is that we have to build

00:09:55,319 --> 00:10:02,310
fast applications I can't remember if my

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:05,610
definition from John Stowe org the the

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:08,880
latest one has building fast sites in it

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:12,439
but the old one definitely did jam stack

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:16,139
applications tend to be really fast and

00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:17,970
with server-side rendering you really

00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:21,120
improve the performance of your a single

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,560
page application or your perceived

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,290
performance of your a single page

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,199
application and we've been able to do

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,839
this for years we've had fastboot for

00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:34,769
ages and it's relatively easy to set up

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,410
and but there is a slight problem if you

00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:41,130
are running fast good in production then

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:44,459
you might need to actually host a node

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,319
server somewhere and as I said now it

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:49,740
doesn't allow you to host servers like

00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:52,170
you could do it in potentially service

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:56,670
functions but I'm not sure fastboot is

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:59,130
set up to be optimum in that and so if

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,079
you did actually run fast food

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,790
production that would have you start

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:06,290
sleeping

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:08,330
them the jams Jam continuum what you

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,640
don't want so how do we get this how do

00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,500
we get service at rendering the benefits

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,810
service at rendering without coming to

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,300
host your own server well this is where

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:21,110
pre-rendering comes in with a massive

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,920
thanks to Ed Faulkner we have this make

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:28,130
this amazing number on called primer I

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,100
would say writing for plaus for Edie but

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,380
I don't want to do that here so maybe

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,830
you know 2,000 chat or something like

00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,910
that

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:40,280
if you are following along and so what

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,280
is primer what does it do with a tiny

00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,080
bit of effort you can set up

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:48,380
pre-rendering which is a way of telling

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,920
your ember application what the what the

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:54,290
routes that you want to you want to

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,420
build a build time actually are so you

00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,620
have this list of you know all the posts

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,460
or whatever it is if you're building a

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:05,450
blog or something like that and build

00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:07,640
time your app will use fastboot render

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,790
your application and then save that

00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,730
juicy HTML to disk which can actually be

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:17,780
served statically so you can start using

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:21,230
a CDN and this is where it goes back to

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,790
using hosting like magnify and it's also

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,710
probably worth mentioning that I'm not

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,620
getting paid by notify to say all of

00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:31,040
this and other static hosting providers

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,940
are available and so thanks to Ed we are

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:39,830
one step closer to earning our

00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:41,540
jam-making scarce badge and so far if

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,210
you've been following along you might be

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,730
thinking this just kind of sounds like

00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,610
you know a static site generator you

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:52,520
know we just it's just the same as using

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:55,610
Jekyll or middleman and everything that

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:59,420
I've said so far would definitely make

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,699
me feel that way and but the interesting

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,489
thing here about the J in J

00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:05,989
the JavaScript aspect of it it's not

00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:07,759
that we're using javascript to build

00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:10,999
this allocation all the matters that

00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,040
doesn't matter at all the key thing

00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:16,220
about making other this modern

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,429
architecture is that we have a gem life

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:24,139
cycle when you render your application

00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:26,720
when you get your HTML you then once

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,720
it's loaded you load JavaScript you load

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,989
you JavaScript application and then

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,699
ember we have this thing where once fast

00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:37,040
food has finished rendering and the same

00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:38,600
is true with parameter it loads the

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,579
Ember application the full ember

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,859
application and that means that has a

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:45,649
few interesting things you could build

00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:48,999
something like a to-do app in with Jam

00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:52,399
technologies so you could have like your

00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:54,799
public to-do items as static HTML and

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,290
etc and all that stuff not sure that's

00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:01,699
the best use case but you could if you

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:04,639
wanted to and or another example is

00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:06,679
something like a blog you could load

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,379
your HTML really quickly and then once

00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:12,169
it's loaded your application boots up

00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:13,539
and then if you want to move to a

00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:16,609
different route

00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:18,259
you only need to load a type of JSON or

00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:21,589
something like that the data that is

00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:24,769
related to your next page and that will

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:26,299
vastly increase performance and if

00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:29,779
you're using something like ember data

00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:31,730
the performance is way faster because

00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,559
you'd like to already have that data

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:38,179
loaded into the store and it is

00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:39,379
literally instantaneous so that is a

00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:42,259
kind of a whirlwind

00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:45,249
introduction to Jam what it is and how

00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:49,369
to do with an ember and it probably

00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:51,949
might seem a bit simple here and you

00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:53,359
know I'm joking here you know I've said

00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:55,939
a lot of things it's a lot to think

00:14:53,359 --> 00:15:00,619
about and to be honest it's a lot to

00:14:55,939 --> 00:15:03,199
remember to know what to do and in the

00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:05,239
Embera ecosystem we don't tend to like

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,579
this idea of you know here's the tools

00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:10,549
just put it together yourself we like to

00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:12,780
build shared solutions we like to build

00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:16,410
things in a way that everybody

00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:18,720
can make use of the collective knowledge

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,230
quickly without having to learn it all

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,700
from scratch

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:25,920
so there we I've been thinking very

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:30,060
strongly about like a complete solution

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,010
to gel in amber I'm going to take a

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,630
slight diversion to kind of look at some

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,540
of the other big players in the jam

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:39,660
ecosystem and explain how they work and

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:42,540
how Amber's solution is slightly

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,280
different so if you know anything about

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,350
Jam you've probably heard of Gatsby or

00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:52,770
you press and they are a big players

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:54,780
Gatsby is for react fans and as the name

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:57,120
might suggest to view press is for

00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,610
review facts and both of these are

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,200
really great choices if I'm saying

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,540
anything if I'm implying anything

00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,460
negative about them in my comparisons

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,140
it's not true they're great projects

00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,710
they've got great communities they've

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,270
got great documentation the the thing

00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:15,330
that I think is different or the thing

00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:19,160
that I see is a problem is that both of

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:22,230
them are quite low level tools they are

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,530
building blocks that you have to do most

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,420
of the actual building now you're

00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,820
probably gonna have some really good

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,830
time you know using the documentation

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,920
following along building applications

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:38,040
with it you know as I said they've got

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,070
great communities and gatsby even has 15

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,050
million dollars in funding whatever it

00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:46,740
means for an open-source project to have

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:48,810
funding time will tell and so as I said

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,940
you'll probably have a really good time

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,130
following the documentation and building

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,440
something and getting started and even

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:59,310
if you don't want to start it from

00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,940
scratch and use the building block you

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:05,880
could find a number of starters I think

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:09,510
there's a Gatsby starters whole website

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,650
where you can browse and find where

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,710
people have done most of the work

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:17,310
themselves and you can start where they

00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:19,770
left off and the only issue with this

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,200
the starters is that they are

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,660
essentially github repos and to use

00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,580
other people's work you have to fork the

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:31,280
work that they've done

00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:34,880
and it was great that's wonderful but it

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:38,270
means that if say the starter updates

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:43,670
you have to then do like a sync from

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:45,380
upstream and it can it tends to lead to

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:48,710
people not doing upgrades you kind of

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,870
locked in a period of time and that's

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,350
you know that's one way of doing it and

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,930
this is where I felt like we could do a

00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,070
slightly different approach here and

00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,320
what I said earlier on about this

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,090
complete solution the shared solutions

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,070
in the uber ecosystem that's where I

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,160
felt like we could bring something new

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:11,930
to the table and this is where we

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:14,750
introduced Empress Empress is embers and

00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:16,790
surgeon Jam stack and it has a

00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,490
fundamentally different approach to

00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,470
building jobs like applications and I

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,560
don't just mean because it's using ember

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:28,880
instead of react or view firstly there

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:32,860
is no single Empress installable add-on

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,760
it's not a building block we have a

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,880
different way of doing this we have

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:41,150
essentially a set of products focused on

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,100
one particular use case I'll go through

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:46,370
and quickly some of these products and

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,350
then I'll do a bit of a deep dive on one

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:52,130
of them which is which will help us

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:55,550
understand the architecture so each of

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:58,790
these products essentially try to do one

00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:00,440
thing and one thing well I'm splitting

00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,900
them up here into this table Bay then

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,020
alpha just because they're slightly

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,140
easier the stable ones are a lot easier

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:11,570
to get started with if you're interested

00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,760
and some of the beta or alpha ones are

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,110
either still a target in progress or

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,330
slightly under death

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:20,420
documented but I'll talk a bit more

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,210
about that at the end so let's go

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,580
through the top ones real quick and push

00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:31,310
blog it does exactly what it says on the

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:34,310
tin it is a blog system and it is our

00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:37,790
very first product in amber Empress

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,559
ecosystem and it's the thing that made

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,940
us is the

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,460
flagship it's the thing that made us

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,370
think of this in terms of products and

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,779
the next one up is is guide maker it's

00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,429
probably something that a lot of people

00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:51,370
won't have heard about but a lot more

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:55,509
people will have used guide maker

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:57,850
happens to be powering the Ember guides

00:19:55,509 --> 00:20:02,139
so be good if you've ever gone to guys

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:05,080
ember.js calm you've used the output of

00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:07,990
a guide maker application your guide

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:12,129
field guide is like a style guide or a

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:13,480
design system documentation - it's it's

00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:16,830
different from gripe maker it has

00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,330
different focuses and and it's

00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,909
specifically designed to make it easier

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,220
for you to build a design system and

00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:26,740
we've used it recently for the ember

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,139
website redesign project and field guide

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:33,070
was really instrumental in helping us

00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:37,200
make sure that that was that the Ember

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:40,629
style guide is something that will

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,519
document and bring the new design system

00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:45,399
of the Ember website to each of the

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,539
different applications over time and if

00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:48,039
you haven't already checked out the

00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:52,929
November website it is pretty awesome

00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:54,999
and I spend a lot of time recently

00:20:52,929 --> 00:21:00,580
getting that up to date so check it out

00:20:54,999 --> 00:21:02,980
and let me know what you think so next

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,990
up we have some beta ones open slide I'm

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:08,850
using open slide right now to do this

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:11,169
slide system it's you know it's

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,700
interesting it's a little bit janky

00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,100
because it's using reveal and the

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:19,210
front-end aspect in the template aspect

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:22,119
and reveal is nice but it has some rough

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,860
edges and one of the reasons I like to

00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,950
use it is because all of the Empress

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:29,259
products focus on trying to use mark 10

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,360
as the basic building blocks so you

00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:32,950
write all of your content mark 10 so

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,039
each of my science is actually just a

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:41,200
markdown file and training buddy is like

00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:42,690
a sidecar app for workshops em the last

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,059
few are

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,429
kind of experiments at the moment RFC

00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:49,229
process and tech survey but hopefully

00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,849
they'll be something that people can

00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:53,700
check out pretty soon if you're

00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:54,840
interested in any of these or if you

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,899
want to know more you can go to

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,169
github.com slash in person all of this

00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:03,269
code is there so as I said let's jump

00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:05,580
into emperor's blog and have a look at

00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:07,229
what it is what it does and we can talk

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,379
about the archer architecture of an

00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:13,889
empress product using empress blog as an

00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:19,049
example so this is what you get when you

00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:21,509
run the empress blog quick start and if

00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:24,239
you recognize it that's probably because

00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:27,059
you know this has been the default ghost

00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:30,899
templates the Casper template I think

00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:34,289
it's called so this is essentially a

00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:37,499
shallow Fork of the Casper template

00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:41,700
because ghost uses hello bars and as we

00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:44,269
all know ember templates are close to

00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,849
handlebars j/s which means that we can

00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:49,169
tweak them just a tiny bit and maintain

00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:52,590
a fork without too much effort

00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:54,779
um and what this looks like what the

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,210
empress blog QuickStart actually looks

00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:59,879
like is that we create ourselves an

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,970
ember application in this case called

00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:04,710
super blog we jump into the super block

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,559
and then we installed two atoms we

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,989
install and press blog and post blog

00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,909
Casper template so first thing you know

00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:14,580
is here you might not have seen in

00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:17,190
permanent Umbra that's just a quick way

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,989
to get started if you don't have ember

00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:23,879
CLI and installed globally but if you're

00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:26,009
watching this you might already be in

00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:29,899
the amber community so you might just be

00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:32,549
able to do ember new yeah super block

00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:35,609
and then the other thing to note of

00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:38,099
interest is the fact that we're

00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:40,950
installing two atoms into our host

00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:43,799
application so we have the members blog

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,690
which is like the brains the system at

00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,659
all as I call it and then we have a

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:51,450
template what that actually looks like

00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:54,880
and what each of those what that does

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:57,070
are kind of go into more detail here so

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,160
as we saw in the QuickStart we have this

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,880
host app it's just a normal Emperor

00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,250
nothing any different

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,910
ember New York reddit member up we then

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:11,620
install in Bruce block now numbers blog

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:15,150
uses some maybe lesser-known api's for

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:18,790
ember CLI and ember CLI add-ons where

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:21,130
when it is installed it will install a

00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,320
bunch of things into your host app like

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,900
fastboot like ember as we already

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,080
mentioned does that for you and I also

00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,700
generate a bunch of example content so

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,500
that if you follow the QuickStart if you

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:38,260
run ever serve or NPM start and you

00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,440
actually got a blog there with posts

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:44,260
authors times officer stuff and so it

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,900
generates a bunch of example content for

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:51,610
you and that's it your your ember app

00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,280
doesn't change from this point on the

00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:56,680
only thing that your ember app actually

00:24:53,280 --> 00:25:00,580
contains is the content it's essentially

00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:03,820
an empty shell the the brains as I

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:07,090
mentioned the build system stuff the

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:10,570
broccoli stuff happens inside embers

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:13,030
blog and actually the definitions for

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,370
your roots as well happen inside empress

00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:17,080
blog as well you'll notice that there's

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,600
nothing no mention about templates here

00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:23,140
this is where the template add-on comes

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,110
in so you're embar templates your CSS

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:28,390
happen in a separate atom so that means

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,370
that you know your roots are defined one

00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,020
place and your templates of somewhere

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,740
else that means that your template

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:39,130
add-on is essentially just HTML and CSS

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,510
with one or two ember templates in taxes

00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,930
thrown in for good measure

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:46,600
so each is its and things like that so

00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,980
and this is where you know it took me a

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,990
while to get to it but this is where

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:58,450
octane can really shine for embers that

00:25:51,990 --> 00:26:02,470
was templates because ember octane is so

00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:04,850
HTML first nowadays so he who has HTML

00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,940
CSS experience will have a fan

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:11,090
tastic time building an empress blog

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:14,360
template and because it's an ember otto

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:16,850
you will be able to create it and run

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,100
the dummy app and it will show you what

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,670
your your content actually will look

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,230
like when your template is done so

00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:26,750
before I get into that how we actually

00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,720
create ourselves our own template I'll

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,550
show another benefit of using this kind

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,800
of a system because the template is

00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:37,220
entire separate you can get a new look

00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,170
and feel for your blog by just npm

00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,540
uninstalling something and installing

00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,340
something else so in this case we're on

00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:49,250
installing Casper and we're installing

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:53,540
another popular open-source template for

00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:55,760
ghost Mattila so just by swapping this

00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:59,270
dependencies you're looking fill up your

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,530
blog entirely changes but maybe we don't

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,810
want to use some of the pre-existing

00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:04,610
templates maybe we want to use one that

00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,800
you want to build yourself well in that

00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,690
case we can make that a little bit

00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,430
easier for developers as I say we really

00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:15,110
want to make the developer experience

00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:16,970
really awesome for this and so has IV

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,100
showed before an NPM and it's kind of

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,440
thing this is just a helper to create to

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:24,070
get started you can create an empress

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,310
blog template or calling it ever comes

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:31,670
or what why and and then as i said you

00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:33,260
can just CD into the folder that are

00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,630
created for you and then you can do npm

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,470
start and what that actually gives you

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:42,620
as i mentioned is this dummy amp now

00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:46,370
doesn't look very good if you if you are

00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:48,380
familiar with the with the ghost

00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:52,760
ecosystem you might recognize this as

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:55,970
the starter template that ghost came out

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:58,430
with I think it was early last year

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,230
January last year and that is

00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,420
essentially just a way for you to get

00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,540
started quickly and it gives you some

00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:08,330
structure and in our case it has a

00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:11,870
application template an index HBS you

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:14,690
know a post component and I think it

00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:18,229
also has like a author route and things

00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:20,779
this so as I mentioned we're creating

00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:24,409
these example templates when you create

00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:27,679
this use that helper and if you just

00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:30,919
know a little bit of HTML CSS now thanks

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:34,309
to in brockton anybody who is just HTML

00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:37,340
and CSS developer can come in here and

00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:40,009
build something build an entirely new

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,559
template that can be leveraged that can

00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:45,169
leverage the jam stack in all of its

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,029
story very quickly and this is something

00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:49,789
that really excites me about what our

00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:52,759
community community can bring to jam

00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:54,559
stack revolution and so that's a kind of

00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,859
an overview of what we have right now I

00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:01,849
want to go a little bit into the future

00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:03,919
of Empress and how people might get

00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:05,690
involved if they're interested the first

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,820
thing I'll say is that this architecture

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:12,979
that I described this idea of having a a

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:15,559
host Emperor system ad on a template

00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:18,950
alone that is the same for every single

00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:21,679
one of these Empress products so a guide

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:25,009
maker has a guide made a template etc so

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,259
the future of Empress from my

00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:29,840
perspective is twofold first of all I

00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:32,419
want to try and move some more off the

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,879
beta and alpha products into stables so

00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:37,549
people can get used can get some use out

00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:41,570
of them and part of the thing hold in

00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:44,029
the back is related to my second aspect

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,759
of this a lot of this stuff is under

00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:48,470
developed under site under documented

00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:50,479
it's nicely well developed but it's

00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,029
under documented and hopefully by the

00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:55,729
time that people are saying this and

00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:59,330
Empress stock dev will have been stood

00:29:55,729 --> 00:30:01,690
up it'll have some example content there

00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,309
but it will have links if people want to

00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,229
contribute and want to help with

00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:08,749
actually documenting some of this stuff

00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:11,090
and I over the next few months will be

00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:16,250
you know playing my brain around

00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:18,710
on that so one of the reasons why some

00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,970
things are in beta is because even

00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,790
though I'm using open slide right now

00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:26,110
the documentation isn't there so these

00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:29,270
are related the two aspects are related

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:31,820
and that's pretty much it if anybody is

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,800
interested in talking about empress

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,540
things or if anybody's interested in

00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:39,670
starting their own blog please do try it

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:42,200
