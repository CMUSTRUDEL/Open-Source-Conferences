	Solving Problems for African Soil by Ridhwana Khan

Often smart people build ambitious applications that are meant to solve the world’s problems - like education, food shortages etc. However, the context like limited resources, minimal infrastructure, and smartphone adoption are usually overlooked. Solutions like low bandwidth apps, offline-first solutions are never at the top of the list even though they are sometimes most appropriate.

In this talk I’d like to walk you through some of the challenges that Africans face and how we can utilise some of Ember’s features as a tool to support relevant and effective solutions.
