Description: 
	Solving Problems for African Soil by Ridhwana Khan

Often smart people build ambitious applications that are meant to solve the world’s problems - like education, food shortages etc. However, the context like limited resources, minimal infrastructure, and smartphone adoption are usually overlooked. Solutions like low bandwidth apps, offline-first solutions are never at the top of the list even though they are sometimes most appropriate.

In this talk I’d like to walk you through some of the challenges that Africans face and how we can utilise some of Ember’s features as a tool to support relevant and effective solutions.

[Music]

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,970
hi everybody thank you for attending my

00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,369
talk today

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,770
my name is Ramona and I'm a senior

00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:31,930
software engineer I currently work at a

00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:35,559
company called Dell you may know it

00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,890
better is Delta 2 or at the practical

00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,260
Devon Twitter and atever I hope flooding

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,710
my passion for coding learning and

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,660
sharing and building communities if

00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,580
you've not heard this episode before

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,979
it's one of the many South African

00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,199
accents I hope that some of you have

00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:56,830
been to South Africa particularly Cape

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,979
Town which is beautiful if not I hope

00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,449
that you'd visit sometime soon in

00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,610
addition to my job all surround a

00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,900
nonprofit organization in South Africa

00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,479
called Casa Metz

00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,820
Claire Metz is an after-school program

00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:13,360
that exposes students in under-resourced

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,970
communities to stir water in the

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,820
environments of kasi Metz has allowed me

00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,640
to appreciate the challenges that we as

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,950
African space and it's inspired me to

00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,079
Bhosle write the stroke to share my

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,350
experiences on a global level and

00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,270
secondly both my own applications with

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,240
performance at the forefront of my mind

00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:38,189
to compensate for the challenges that we

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,189
encounter in developing communities

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,600
unless map the countries marked in

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,030
purple are developing countries the

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,159
darker purple is the high-income

00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,619
developing countries unlike most of

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,740
Africa but they nevertheless are still

00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:56,710
developing so why am i showing you this

00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,140
map the reason is because whatever the

00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,920
challenges that Africa experiences at

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,319
least 80% of these developing countries

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,229
there is all these countries marked in

00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,630
purple they experiencing it too which

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,360
means if you don't follow your acts to

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,250
cater for emerging markets these are the

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,740
people that will either not be able to

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,680
use your exit or or will have difficulty

00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,440
using them living on the African

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,720
continent I have a lot of exposure to

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,360
the

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:32,000
that we experienced here and I'd like to

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:34,550
go through some so the first challenge

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,340
that I'd like to outline is low chilling

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,980
and hello chilling is just really the

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,220
bane of my existence and other Africans

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,720
existence too for those who do not know

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,670
my cloud chilling years

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,610
it's the deliberate shutdown of

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,010
electrical power in part or parts of

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:54,020
into power distributed system generally

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,240
to prevent the failure of the entire

00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,470
system when the demand strains the

00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,840
capacity of the system

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,720
I think the quali drawing that blackouts

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,540
in the US but it's a little bit more

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,180
impactful here the implications of these

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,640
is that there is no power for a minimum

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,430
of four hours in South Africa and most

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,130
days rotating around the different parts

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,410
of the city this is a graph on the slide

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,620
showing the plant breakdown of energy

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,720
over the two months it is absolutely

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,570
insane to think that our plants break

00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,390
down as much in our African countries

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:32,150
like Zimbabwe and Zambia as you can see

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,670
from these tweets the power is turned

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,670
off unexpectedly but at around 12 hours

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,400
at the time as a result of having no

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,290
power we tend to have faint - no cell

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,269
phone reception because the cell phone

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,660
towers are being overused and are unable

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:49,640
to handle this increased capacity

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,600
cheering these periods no cell phone

00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:56,570
reception means no 2g 3G or 4G thus

00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:01,570
without internet access we are unable to

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,570
use full functionality of applications

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,769
another challenge that a large portion

00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,170
of Africans face is that we have very

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,060
basic digital literacy and this is

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,820
probably due to the reasons that a lot

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,890
of public schools have no computer labs

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,720
and students don't have access to

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,290
computers at home enough

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:26,030
hence complex and unintuitive interfaces

00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:28,850
proved to be a hurdle teacher cost in

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,629
South Africa are also extremely high and

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,839
they also hide now

00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:37,499
Africa South Africa on this chart puts

00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:40,949
between China and Canada with about $10

00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:43,469
per gig you may say this is not too

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:46,499
different compared to the US however

00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:48,360
this is not tip dollars is not

00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:51,659
proportional to the audience of South

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,479
Africans who on earth even less than 50%

00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:59,129
is completed employees in the US or

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,429
Canada while smartphones are common in

00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:04,529
Europe and northern America sub-saharan

00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:07,289
Africa who live in ownership in South

00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:09,990
Africa around 51% of people own a

00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:12,979
smartphone however this is below the

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:18,080
medium of 59 whilst countries like Ghana

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:20,939
Nigeria Kenya and Tanzania even lower

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,879
they still huge populations of a

00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:26,969
population of Africa that uses feature

00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,559
phones which is more affordable than 7

00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:30,719
which is more affordable than smart

00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:34,379
phones because they sell between 20 to

00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:38,129
25 dollars being no cost feature phones

00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:41,399
tend to have slower CPUs Loram lower

00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:43,830
storage older OS versions and some of

00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:47,669
these devices can even be restricted to

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:50,279
just 2g or maximum of eg networks many

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:52,829
contain outdated browsers and they often

00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,079
don't even have touch screens instead

00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:58,860
they have a key period or deep here for

00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:01,559
navigation and Casamance we most of the

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,199
students have either no or low end

00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:06,059
devices they gave coated tech hubs in

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,189
the community with their desktop

00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:10,680
computers in Internet is provided

00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:15,869
however there is a time limit for the

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,829
utilization of these computers the

00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:24,559
internet penetration rates are between

00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:28,379
75% level 75% globally and

00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:30,770
in South Africa DS it's about just 59

00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:33,590
percent whilst other African countries

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:37,099
like again ganya Kenya and Tanzania are

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,660
below 40% the infrastructure is in

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:41,180
lacking in under-resourced communities

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,569
in South Africa and other parts of

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:47,840
Africa hence very few have constant

00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:50,720
internet access instead most people end

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,449
up using 2g or 3G networks where they

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,970
are able but it sometimes there's no

00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:58,009
connection at all if we look at the

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,259
statistics for the top apps that I

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,479
downloaded in Africa unlike something

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,880
like the Google Play Store you will see

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,639
that the light versions of applications

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:12,199
when available always end up being at

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:14,419
the top of these statistics we need to

00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,539
optimize for fast loading performance

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:21,289
relative to devices destiny means

00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:24,110
optimizing the CPU memory best battery

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:26,240
and bandwidth usage before divided

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,669
diving into some of these techniques to

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,840
optimize performance let's go to some

00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:31,819
important metrics

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,849
typically used to measure performance of

00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:36,919
web applications or sites these metrics

00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:41,599
can be measured at different phases of

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:44,060
the loading cycle so the first one is

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,550
the first paint the first paint marks

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,069
the points immediately after navigation

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,469
when the browser Randall renders some

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:53,330
pixels to the screen depending on the

00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:55,669
structure of the page this could be

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,919
displaying the background color or it

00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:00,440
could be the entire page being rendered

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,080
it's a really depends on how the app was

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,690
structured and how intent full they were

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,870
about performance the we want to

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,330
optimize most of the page being rendered

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,550
the first content full paint is the

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,699
point when the browser renders the first

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,849
bit of content from the Dom which must

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:21,979
be text in image or just any element for

00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,710
site visitors with this time signifies

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:26,690
when actual content has been loaded on

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,990
the page and it wasn't just like any

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,969
change the first meaningful paint

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:36,409
measures when the page appears

00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:39,690
meaningfully complete the first CPU idle

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:42,990
marks the first time in which pages main

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:45,150
is quiet enough to handle input and the

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,700
time to eat active measures when a user

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,370
can consistently interact which means

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,510
touch or click with all the page

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:56,490
elements so in subsequent sections I

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,040
will be providing a high level overview

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,620
of some techniques that we can use to

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,080
optimize for performance within emerging

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,780
markets they will include firstly

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,630
reducing the bundle size secondly

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,230
server-side or static rendering the

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,900
implementation of service workers and

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,670
number 4 - some other smaller terms in

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,160
each of these sections we will reference

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,130
the metric that we are optimizing for

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,510
and we will also give examples within

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:29,240
the context of ember

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,240
we are clickable so let's dive right in

00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,020
in modern times

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,200
most of our web applications I have

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:41,100
really heavily reliant on JavaScript and

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,990
we ship so my JavaScript he uses then it

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,960
has become one of the most expensive

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,120
resources on the web we load our

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,820
applications without thinking of the

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,760
cost implication on both the hard way in

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,160
the network of a user's device the

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,990
consequences of loading to my transcript

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,020
and feature phones are low-end

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:03,180
smartphones in emerging markets are

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,040
substantial on such devices the

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,470
JavaScript can end up block in the main

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,170
did for significant amount of time

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,140
that's increasing the time to interact

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,510
with the application in addition the

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,430
passing of the extra JavaScript can

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,920
result in a breakdown of that thread

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:23,430
causing applications to sometimes just

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,230
run out of memory or hang or crash this

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,920
leaves the user of the feeling of

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,110
extreme frustration we he or she ends up

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:36,089
clicking around the interface without

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:38,970
seeing an effect according to el us -

00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:42,120
article the cost of javascript in 2019

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:44,800
which I recommended every person reads

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,230
he outlines how on mobile it takes

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,110
three to four times longer for median

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,240
phone like a moto G four to execute read

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,820
its JavaScript complete a high-end

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,240
device like the pixel T and it takes

00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,630
over six times as long under low-end

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,950
device like they are to tell one acts

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,529
similarly downloading loads of

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:08,140
JavaScript and CSS files on a slow

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:11,140
network connection increases the first

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,149
meaningful paint I'm VI by leaving the

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,200
user with acceptance a feeling of

00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:19,420
frustration according to Google's

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,320
double-click when come we'll compare

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:26,380
sites the low in five seconds compared

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,529
to sites that low in 19 seconds the

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:33,160
fastest sites it is 70%

00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:36,940
longer average session things 35% lower

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,279
bounce rates and 25% higher air view

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,880
mobility than the slower counterparts

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,860
that's a lot of increases knowing that

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,980
the first meaningful paint and the time

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,140
to interact is too high if it's too high

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,600
the juices will leave our sites and most

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,329
likely not written how can you then

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,700
reduce the bundle site so some very

00:11:55,329 --> 00:12:00,459
simple solutions include the first one

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,010
is many file in concatenate in your

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:04,870
JavaScript both we can improve on the

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,360
overall performance of our sites and

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,810
applications by many finally on the

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,790
transcript to reduce the file size and

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:16,209
concatenating our relevant files to

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,459
reduce the number of requests in every

00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:20,589
CLI we are fortunate that the J's files

00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:23,050
are ready minified by default in

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,529
production using broccoli uglify draya's

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,000
and then whatever files are ready

00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:31,029
concatenated into just one javascript

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,199
file however we can improve on us even

00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:37,600
further with code splitting so instead

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,180
of shoving all the JavaScript at once we

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,180
can split the JavaScript but page routes

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,940
or component this means that we can sum

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,120
the minimum amount of JavaScript to

00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:52,330
prioritize what a user will need and the

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,310
after we can lazy load the rest so we

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,160
can fetch the additional bundles even in

00:12:54,310 --> 00:13:00,160
the background when the uses idle or in

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,620
response to user initiated action once

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,890
we have introduced the overall amount of

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,520
coding apps we have avoided loading code

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:11,920
that the user may not use and reduce the

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,060
amount of code needed during the initial

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,430
load another common way that we end up

00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,130
loading our Java scripts is by importing

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,530
loads and nodes of Iran's we just keep

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:26,110
throwing it in me and libraries into our

00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,720
applications instead we could have

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,910
simply claimed the same functionality

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,190
sometimes variety which is a small

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:37,710
custom JavaScript function or by

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:39,820
importing only a portion of that library

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,070
importing only a portion of the library

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,520
is now possible with tree shaking

00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:47,500
tree shaking was free shaking we can

00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,020
take advantage of static import

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,480
statements to put in only the specific

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,300
and relevant parts of es6 modules

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,060
hence eliminating dead code it's

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,370
possible to utilize codes music and tree

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,830
shaking from the embroider v2 package

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,560
for those that don't know embroider is

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:08,890
modern fully featured Perl system that

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,170
works in tandem with ember CLI it also

00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,960
newly embraces the ACMA standard for

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:17,200
importing es6 modules which makes she

00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,510
shaking achievable however it is

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,760
important to note that embroider is

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,770
currently in beta and there are some

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,600
risks to be aware of it using it in

00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,420
production you can read more about

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,760
embroider on NS status on their own

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:36,220
estate this page you can't improve if

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,230
you don't measure so some of the tools

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,630
that we can use to audit our sights

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,420
include the Google Chrome's lighthouse

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,940
tool for performance audits depth audits

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,800
that will be useful to look at

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,380
boss you're using our bundle size and

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,070
they are very aptly named so the first

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:55,950
one is JavaScript Putin is high on it

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:58,890
and that reveals how much CPU time each

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:02,400
script on the page will consume along

00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:04,500
with its URL then the onion JavaScript

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,200
audit which reveals the JavaScript

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,060
downloaded by the current page but their

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,880
child but it shows the JavaScript that

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,830
is never used the many fights are Script

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,080
audits visual compiled a list of and

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,750
many five resources that it finds in the

00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,640
current page from there you can simply

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,160
take action for many find those files

00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:29,130
manually or comment in your well system

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:30,840
to do it for you so the second one that

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,570
I can think of is the Embassy and I

00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,360
bundle analyzer the Embassy and I bundle

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,400
analyzer analyzes the size and the

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,220
content of your ember apps bundled

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,950
output using a really cool and easy to

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,930
understand visualization more

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,820
specifically we'll be able to see which

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,740
individual models make it into your

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,630
final bundle so if you look at the

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,670
picture you'll be able to see that it

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,810
shows which which are the different

00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:59,340
packages that have gone into your bundle

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,620
we also can find out how big each

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:04,280
contained module is including the row

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,650
source the magnified and the gzip sizes

00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,020
finally we can by looking at the diagram

00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,270
we can kind of see which fund of which

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,100
of the packages have made it into a

00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:17,460
bundle one mistake and then we can

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:20,910
optimize our bundle size the third one

00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,010
is funder phobia and so before I

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,710
actually install a bundle to my

00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:28,410
application I like to know how a bundle

00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,810
will impact my site is by the phobia

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,940
does this by showing the cost of an NPM

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,340
package by providing the information on

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,830
the size of the package how far it

00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,110
downloads on 2g and how fast it

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,180
downloads on a 3G network a what

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,240
percentage of other dependencies that

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,970
package

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:50,459
Raisa thus we can then make informed

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,459
decisions and ready to edit or not

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,190
well JavaScript single page applications

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,529
can be quite snappy once they are fully

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,380
loaded this is this time between the

00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:04,329
load and time to interact we uses a

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,120
usually presented with the blacks blank

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:09,640
screen this is because for most single

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,850
page applications the initial document

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,250
written by Java is empty thus resulting

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:18,819
in an increase in the first content for

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:21,189
paint so what if I wanted the best of

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:24,130
both worlds a quick initial load time

00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,030
but also just snappy successive

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,550
interactions

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:30,730
this is achievable using server-side

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,470
rendering or static rendering for all or

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,530
most of the popular pages in your

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:38,320
applications thus can result in almost

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,360
instant first content full paint which

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,429
is particularly useful for developing

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,890
countries we network connections may be

00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:47,559
unreliable remember that the first

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,809
content will paint which we discussed in

00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,120
one of the earlier sides measures the

00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:55,210
time from when the page starts loading

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,550
to it any parts of the pages content is

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,620
rendered on the screen using this

00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:03,160
technique we are then able to display

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:07,750
useful information that is content to

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:09,730
the user instantly when I first went in

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,970
full panes is less than a thousand

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,550
milliseconds and uses are really happy

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,980
when the value is between a thousand

00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:20,380
sixty thousand milliseconds one two

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,929
three seconds usual users they're

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:26,170
usually a little bit less pissed but

00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:29,050
still pretty happy but over these second

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:31,960
so say three to five seconds sucks

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:35,220
causing frustration so over five seconds

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:39,910
uses I'm just completely lost interest

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:44,140
it's really simple to server-side render

00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:47,260
pages in Emma and also of all we need to

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,510
do is to just use instant install a

00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,960
hospital member which actually

00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:56,530
renders the application and allows us to

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,890
pre-render any list of URLs into static

00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:02,200
HTML files and bail time as a results

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,870
the pages can be self statically and it

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,870
has the fast four spins of the HTML

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,270
content from fastboot so all we do is

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:13,300
reinstall and the CLI possible to

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:15,370
install prim Bob and then we can

00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:20,440
configure the URLs that we want to pre

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:27,910
render now this setup we can simply even

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:30,520
just see the HTML Viacom since the most

00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,320
important values here are with the first

00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,570
potential paint we can run the

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,850
performance audit once again and we

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,800
notice how the value decreases we see

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:44,500
the value from the lighthouse chrome

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:46,660
tools it's great it's great progress

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,570
that we are able to render our assets

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,520
and our content optimally especially to

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:54,640
ease the burden of slow network

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,700
connections high data costs in case of

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,230
low end devices but what about taking it

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,050
one step further

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:05,110
so as workers in caching can reduce

00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:07,510
user's data costs even further and they

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,630
can render pages even faster with the

00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:13,030
least amount of processing time not only

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,580
that but we can also render applications

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,800
offline for those for any connections

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:21,010
during low chaining was passing through

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,810
poor network areas a serviceworker is

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,760
essentially a background script that

00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:27,820
runs separately from the main main

00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,550
process did respond ad films including

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,410
incepting network request caching or

00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,770
retrieving ready resources from the

00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:37,600
cache and delivering push messages the

00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,000
implementation of service workers is

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,630
pretty simple simple using a magnet

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,330
iran's

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,400
so here's a very brief look on how to

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,680
integrate service workers into our

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,560
application the dockyard and the

00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,630
serviceworker dock

00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,600
makes it really easy we use the

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:56,010
following commands cocl bus riders amber

00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,810
installed serviceworker

00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,720
which is installed the serviceworker

00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:02,790
when the page loads then we do my

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,920
install service working index and the

00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:07,470
serviceworker except cash which

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,380
essentially captures our index and HTML

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,360
page and all the other static assets so

00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,490
at this point if you have to disconnect

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,860
your internet connection or time into an

00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,750
offline mode in other browsers dev tools

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,350
and refresh the page

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:24,000
our app should still load then we can do

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,950
we can take it one step even further

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,620
where we can install and the

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,440
serviceworker cache fallback which then

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:34,320
texted any non-static resources like

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,120
request to the API and just like that

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,660
our service workers would be up and

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,180
running

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,640
we just need to browse the app for few

00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,230
moment moment whilst online and it will

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,510
essentially be priming the fallback

00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,060
cache and afterwards we can put our

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,250
browser into offline mode and try to

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:54,330
load a page that we have visited before

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:59,190
and guess what it should now sell your

00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:01,140
API responses from the cache but can we

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,650
can make our applications even more

00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,320
functional I mean if I think about it

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,660
when I'm without internet during times

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,460
of low cheating and not only when to

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,430
view data but I might want to fill out

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,140
forms or bookmark some data or maybe

00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:20,100
even send some information through to

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,350
the application I think the memory of a

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,210
goldfish and once I close it up I'm

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,940
really not going to remember to come

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:30,090
back to that app so this is where my

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,730
pouch comes into play for us and it

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:35,510
basically is data persistence and the

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,490
pouch allows data to sync automatically

00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:40,710
once a connection is restored in the

00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:44,280
background the data is saved on the time

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,149
side using index TV or web sequel and we

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:51,639
just keep using the

00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:53,919
the datastore API once again in order to

00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:56,829
test our improve performance and offline

00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,009
strategy lighthouse comes to the rescue

00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:01,809
you can see your cache finds a files and

00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:03,879
you can use Network requests to

00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:06,279
determine where a network request where

00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:07,749
Network we're the with the request is

00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,299
getting answered from is it from the

00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:11,979
capture the API and you can also use

00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:14,979
something like Google Analytics to track

00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:20,169
metrics that will help us to assess the

00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:22,719
impact of our service welcome finally we

00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:24,519
come to other performance charts so

00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:27,519
there are a couple of techniques that

00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,199
I'm not able to influence DP but I'd

00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,759
still like to the some of them out

00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:33,339
because I believe that when they are

00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,829
used appropriately they will provide

00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:36,519
better accessibility for emerging

00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:40,359
markets

00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:42,939
some of them include firstly using SVG's

00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:45,549
we were able to or else optimizing

00:23:42,939 --> 00:23:48,579
images by using tools like squash or

00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:50,919
image optimizer HTML sources are also

00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:53,649
really useful to serve different images

00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:57,299
to da from visitors a company called fun

00:23:53,649 --> 00:24:00,149
space reduce the image plane out by 86%

00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:03,549
resulting in a reduction in no time of

00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:06,899
65 percent this improved user experience

00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:10,059
helped double phones based ecommerce

00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:13,329
purchases conversion ratio cut bounce

00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:18,839
rates but 20% increased mobile revenue

00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:18,839
by 7% and dramatically improve SEO

00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:24,969
optimizing and singing through only the

00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:26,919
necessary keys in our JSON payloads can

00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:30,189
really just optimize our network

00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,649
requests in our JSON we should serialize

00:24:30,189 --> 00:24:34,719
and compress adequately as well in

00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:36,939
addition and doctor the technology like

00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:40,689
graph QL would automate the optimal

00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:42,580
param param realization of data fetches

00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:44,950
thus increasing the

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,169
performance Instagram increased

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,200
impressions and user profile scrolling

00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:52,269
interactions by decreasing the responses

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,710
of the choice are needed for displaying

00:24:52,269 --> 00:25:02,260
comments but 33% for the median and 50%

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:04,390
for the 95th percentile and finally we

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,580
can use techniques like adaptive loading

00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:09,700
to tailor the experience based on the

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:12,340
user's constraints adaptive loading uses

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,860
signals to determine the network CPU

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,809
Kolkata and memory and based on those

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,630
values we can then conditionally load

00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:21,639
more highly interactive components or

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,039
run computationally heavily heavy

00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:26,250
operations whilst not sending these

00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:29,019
scripts down if you know slower device

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,789
however it's useful to know that the web

00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:34,179
properties that are used to determine

00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:37,360
Network CPU are co count and memory and

00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:39,639
not available via the web api to all

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,830
especially older browsers this

00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:45,070
unfortunately does not make it extremely

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:47,320
useful for African markets idiots but it

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,389
is a useful technique the most likely

00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,720
will be used more commonly in the near

00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:54,850
future using all or most of these

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,830
strategies that have outlined allows us

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,990
to build more efficient applications

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:02,320
that will deliver an improved experience

00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:04,360
within Africa however our professional

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,000
environments usually consist of teams

00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:10,389
that include multiple developers working

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,370
on one application together within these

00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:14,740
teams not all developers are

00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,970
knowledgeable or even mindful of

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:21,130
performance so how do I go about

00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:25,559
proactively maintaining a code base with

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:28,120
the team for just optimal performance

00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,370
this is where performance budgets

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,909
integrated with the CIS will become

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:36,730
really useful so why is the performance

00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:39,220
budgets a performance budget is a limit

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:42,039
with pages or components which the team

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,679
are not allowed to exceed any less money

00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,400
the performance guru mentions the theory

00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,440
of important metrics that we

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,290
to use in order to incorporate this

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,000
budget the first one is master timings

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,370
which are based on the user experience

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,470
when loading the page so things like

00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:59,480
time to interact a first content web

00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,010
page it's that first page of metrics

00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,220
that I showed you and I started the

00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:06,680
presentation we may need to pay several

00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,740
of these metrics together in order to

00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,930
represent our full story then this

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,580
quantity based metrics so these are

00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,770
based on draw values so the weight of

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,930
the JavaScript the number of HTTP

00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:21,680
requests these are directly correlated

00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:23,960
to a browser experience and finally we

00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,270
have blue base metrics which are schools

00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,520
generally by tools such as lighthouse or

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:31,310
web page test they often just provide

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,800
one single number on a series to grade

00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,450
the site furthermore we can apply

00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,250
different budget stone mobile

00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,620
applications forced our desktop

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,420
applications first device classes

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,090
because they are underlying hardware

00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,310
like CPUs and memory and the connection

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:51,860
capabilities tougher across these

00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:54,140
different experiences so an example

00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,480
budget on my personal website could

00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,580
include something like the home page

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,730
must shop less than hundred and seventy

00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:04,310
caves of kilobytes of JavaScript on

00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:06,590
mobile it should include less than two

00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:09,320
minutes of images on a desktop but maybe

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,150
500 kilobytes and mobile on page load

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,810
and then we get lazy load the rest

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:17,090
afterwards it should load and get

00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:19,340
interactive in less than seven seconds

00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:21,320
on an Android go which is one of the

00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:24,080
more popular devices in sub-saharan

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,820
Africa and also maybe the score needs to

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,040
be greater than 80 on the lighthouse

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,170
woman's audit these are just some

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,420
examples of what I could put into my

00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:34,280
performance budget it is useful to know

00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,800
that there's some standards which we can

00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,890
integer - like for mid-range mobile

00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,840
devices with slow TG connections a good

00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:44,990
target for force loads is to load the

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,270
page and be interactive in five seconds

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,270
or less for subsequent loads a good

00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:50,940
target is still

00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:52,950
in under two seconds this is where the

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,679
developer has the opportunity to set the

00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:58,830
precedent to be inclusive are the

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,990
emerging markets but the most tricky

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,490
thing about creating a budget is usually

00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,309
to come up with the performance metrics

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,920
themselves one way to do this is to use

00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:10,620
a calculator like performance budget at

00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,540
i/o to get some baseline and then

00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,309
configure the budget based on your

00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,590
knowledge of the type of application

00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:18,450
being created as well as your target

00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,700
markets the see on the slide is

00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,140
performance budget at i/o and it's a

00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,660
really good experience

00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,850
once we've crunched the numbers we want

00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,730
to also proactively stay away from now

00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:32,280
stay away of is not the throughout the

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,110
development process this can be done by

00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,210
integrating something like web pack

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,340
performance hints which he issues

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,530
command line warnings or errors when the

00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,890
butterflies grows over the limit this is

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,250
perfect for your development process

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,830
thereafter

00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:49,770
once we started drawing we can integrate

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:52,890
it with the CI to automatically m4 size

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:55,410
limits on poorer graphs for teams so if

00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,870
the test fails we can simply prevent the

00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:00,179
pull request from being large some scare

00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:02,990
options that can be used is the bundle

00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:06,450
size CI and lifehouse boss

00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:09,600
sorry Lighthouse bite finally I

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:12,350
recommend also using speed curve for the

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,960
reactive monitoring so that we can

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:20,250
actually monitor some real users also we

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,320
can improve based on some baseline as a

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,540
result using a performance budget and

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,340
these integration tools developers and

00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,470
machines have performance at the

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,720
forethought of their minds and hence

00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:35,520
it's shown their development practices

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,890
accordingly in conclusion yes the scrap

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,840
again there are really no downsides to

00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,880
make your applications performance there

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,100
are only benefits a performance

00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,740
application opens you up to a whole new

00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:50,130
markets this is millions of additional

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,620
people it is also proven facts based on

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,690
statistics in case studies some of which

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,909
are cited in

00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,429
your slides their performance and route

00:30:55,909 --> 00:31:01,789
increase increases traffic to your sites

00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:05,480
in keep use keeps uses engage for longer

00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:07,789
periods on a fast site used unknown to

00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,460
consume more content some of these

00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:13,850
changes especially server-side rendering

00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:16,789
or even static are rendering allows

00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:18,679
other apps to have enhanced SEO that's

00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:21,919
increasing our leads and signup

00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:25,100
conversion rates in fact the study shows

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,950
the triple complain Pinterest pages for

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:31,700
performance resulted in a 40% decrease

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:35,090
in wait time a 15% increase in SEO

00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:38,179
traffic and a 15% increase in conversion

00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,700
rates a sign up finally for every

00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:43,669
travelers like myself

00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:45,500
PTAs I hailed lifesavers I mean who

00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:47,840
doesn't want to be able to check the

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,330
train schedule or navigate around the

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,879
city year without any network I know I

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,220
do but that being said I hope I've now

00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:57,950
convinced you to think about performance

00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:02,889
and expanding your apps to the African

00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,889
soil why not thank you so much

00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,600
