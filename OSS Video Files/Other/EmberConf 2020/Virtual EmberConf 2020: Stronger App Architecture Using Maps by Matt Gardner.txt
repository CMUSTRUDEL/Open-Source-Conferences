Description: 
	Stronger App Architecture Using Maps by Matt Gardner

Like the cities they represent, interactive maps are complicated feats of engineering. They are resource-intensive microcosms of state management, requiring special data formats and styling specifications.

When the needs of an application go beyond showing points on a map, cartographic applications can quickly grow unwieldy and unsustainable. Throw moving targets, messy data, and squeezed timelines into the mix, and you've got an enormous component that does everything â€“ poorly. This talk discusses the latest mapping technology and approaches to building better components - map-based or otherwise.

[Music]

00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:29,320
I don't want welcome to my apartment we

00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:36,280
are streaming live from New York City

00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:38,230
it's a beautiful day outside yeah I'm

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,989
not going to make any references but I

00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,769
am going to talk about the number one

00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:50,199
thing on everybody's mind right now

00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:51,970
which is Maps so some of the goals for

00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:55,000
this session I'm going to introduce

00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,570
myself a little bit about me about Who I

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,229
am

00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,350
brief history of mapping current

00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:06,159
technology and getting started with

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:09,760
mapping in ember and best practices

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,140
patterns testing strategies I'll leave

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,140
you with one very important thought

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,250
so I'll leave you with one very

00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,510
important thought so a little bit about

00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,830
Who I am

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:38,240
first of all I am from Tulsa Oklahoma

00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:41,930
who here in the room was from Tulsa okay

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,210
so yeah from Tulsa Oklahoma there I

00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,060
studied social science political science

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,520
I did start off in computer science I

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:53,570
thought I wanted to be a programmer and

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,330
then I you know my mother was horrified

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,580
when I switched to political science but

00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,430
here we are

00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:05,090
although it ends well so I moved to

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,800
Boston actually to earn a master's in

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:12,200
studying urban planning with an emphasis

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:14,750
in GIS so there I really discovered that

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,860
I can combine my two favorite things

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:22,850
which is technology and social science

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:26,600
and urban policy so I was able to you

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,750
know more specifically look at using

00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,010
maps as these so this is really powerful

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:35,900
political rhetorical tables for

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,980
conveying and communicating about social

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,590
issues so this mapping technology using

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:48,650
that to really to advance the social

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:52,400
cause or a policy sort of change so I

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:55,430
then moved to New York New York so where

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,739
we are right now I took a job with the

00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,370
city planning department and I'm still

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:04,480
mapping so the end that's all we have

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,880
for today thank you for not kidding

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,690
so what is the city planning department

00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:15,500
a very simple mission although it's very

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:18,920
simple sounding it's to plan for the

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,660
future of New York City surprisingly the

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,840
City Planning Department is responsible

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,330
for the future so what is this what this

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,750
means is any new developments

00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:32,960
Billings any desired zoning change for

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,650
example maybe I want to open up a cat

00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,840
cafe down the street but it's on four

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,940
you know I don't know something else

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,090
like residential so I want to tear down

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,670
you know someone's house and open a cat

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,110
cafe so I probably have to like go

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:54,560
through busy planning or whatever to do

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:57,920
that I'm not doing that so right so the

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,440
team I work with is the NYC planning

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,370
laughs we do software we are software

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,590
duvall entomb we have to two main

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,010
missions build great technology and

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:16,310
modernize the way government does

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:18,470
technology so we are we are changing

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,049
expectations about how government

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,370
delivers digital services I like to

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:29,290
think that we are what does this mean so

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,290
agile agile a if you will

00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,190
yeah this means a lot of different

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:38,240
things to a lot of different people but

00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:41,300
us really it is a stark philosophical

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,500
contrast to what is typical in

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,340
government was just a waterfall approach

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:50,750
which is all of your specs are asked for

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,270
upfront required a front and then you

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,950
that you know sort of you're building

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,590
something for someone you get the specs

00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:00,410
and then the year later you come back

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,790
and you have something that you hate so

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,919
that's not good

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:08,960
agile to us is really simply thinking

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,950
more iteratively not just about the

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,979
technology what about the relationship

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:16,070
between with the customer so you know

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,500
instead of this sort of super

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:21,260
prescriptive and kind of antisocial way

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,919
of building a technology solution for a

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:27,169
human business problem and really work

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,599
closely with customer we really we hit

00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:32,439
her Amy learn

00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:33,309
I mean we react to those learnings week

00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:38,459
after week after week

00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:41,319
demos every week design sessions etc

00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:44,559
open source so government has a weird

00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,419
kind of depends on how you talk to but

00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:48,300
there's there's some fear around open

00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:50,830
source there's a lack of understanding

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,379
really about using open source not so

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,669
much creating it and providing it

00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,879
although that's still there too but

00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:00,969
using it sometimes there's a you know

00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:04,119
this is this can we trust this why are

00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:06,999
we using the enterprise solution we've

00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:11,409
always used that before you know who

00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:13,330
these github people whatever that's the

00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:16,839
attitude that we're trying to change our

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,719
team is fully embraced bill you've been

00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:23,199
using open source and also open sourcing

00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:28,449
our own products so we create software

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:30,759
as a public resource alright so this

00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:34,419
presentation is not about planning labs

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:38,229
but if you are interested there is a QR

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:42,339
code on the screen I just learned about

00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:45,459
QR technology maybe last year it's very

00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:47,259
cool it's I don't know I just think it's

00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:49,689
cool you can open your camera up and you

00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,039
can get a link but literally just

00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:55,809
learning how to use that West South

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:59,499
Korea so urban planners use maps every

00:06:55,809 --> 00:07:02,079
day so there's a reason for that there's

00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:03,789
you know something is being built in the

00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,969
city you need to know the spatial

00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:08,919
context of it you need to know what what

00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:11,079
is this change in this in the built

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,990
environment how might an impact business

00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:17,079
how impact traffic how many impact you

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,669
know zoning or housing in the area so

00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,579
there's a lot of contextual information

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:24,969
that planners really need in order to

00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:27,999
ask the right questions in order to sort

00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:30,419
of follow along with with the with the

00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:34,389
guidelines and the policies around

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:36,849
zoning so our flagship application of

00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:37,269
zola 1,000 New York has used it every

00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:39,999
day

00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:40,610
okay that's not face book but you know

00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:44,180
it

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:47,120
quite a lot I think for a small team we

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:50,330
built this application city planners use

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,539
it advocates lawyers a lot of people use

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,550
it a lot of different use cases so some

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,850
people are you know maybe one except one

00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:01,990
example and where can we build housing

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:07,070
you so lot to look at where all the

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:11,240
residential zoning is and where can I

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:14,530
build in a particular neighborhood is my

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:18,639
property in a flood zone good question

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:21,770
we can show you if property is in a

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:26,270
flood zone 30 years from now or 60 years

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:29,389
from now there is that that availa that

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,680
data is publicly available to you you

00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,020
can also look at property information

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,130
okay I want to who owns the building

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,110
across the street

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,320
you know what what are the other sort of

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:42,409
associated city records for that

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,680
property you know what else can I learn

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:49,250
about that property so all of this is

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:54,290
publicly available so here we are QR

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:58,130
code again zola you know is a way of

00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,250
really sharing information online making

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,839
data easy so there's a big talk about

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,800
you know open data and data is available

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,660
everywhere everyone can access data but

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,880
knowing how to actually have the tools

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,650
to do anything with data is a totally

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,250
different question we hope that Zola is

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:18,290
solving is solving that problem so okay

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,080
if you got a try on hopefully it doesn't

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,940
break no I'm so just a brief history of

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:28,910
maps so there's a rich historical

00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:34,339
context behind maps so it starts with

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:42,560
Jon Snow sorry

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:45,140
right so Jon Snow with an H the 19th

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,560
century English physician a leader in

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,980
development a seizure epidemiology and

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,980
public health

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,810
you know just as exciting as Game of

00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,440
Thrones

00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:00,980
I'm also vegetarian right so he has a

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:05,389
whole biography worth reading another

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,529
time but what is he known for um so this

00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:08,990
is probably a little too familiar

00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:11,690
sounding but he is mapping he mapped

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:15,820
there was cholera outbreak in Soho

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:18,350
London and mid part of the 19th century

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,089
and people didn't understand what was

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:24,920
happening what was coming from so Jon

00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:27,800
Snow mapped the outbreaks and correlated

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,529
those outbreaks with the water comes now

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,199
it's interesting because at the time he

00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:36,380
actually his sort of findings were

00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:38,630
suppressed by the water company so it's

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,180
a bit scandalous because the water

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:44,260
company had its own sort of interest in

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:47,540
protecting us you know its business

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,300
whatever to the detriment of public

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:56,149
health but Johnson was able to use maps

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:58,519
to prove his case so what about mapping

00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:59,810
beyond socio political I'm sorry what

00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,149
about mapping socio political issues

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:05,269
what about so going beyond you know

00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:10,820
public health or even just like geology

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:13,070
and these sorts of things so think he

00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,490
faced was he thinking about Florence

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,820
Kelly

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:20,630
I love Florence Kelly because she's a

00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:22,750
pioneer in mapping technology she was a

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:27,199
late 19th century a 20th century

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:29,420
reformer she was commissioned to study

00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:32,839
urban slums and factories so she was a

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:38,300
she was a labor activist and she used

00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:42,380
mapping to illustrate the sort of the

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:46,910
issues in wealth income asperity and to

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:48,980
really provide a visual kind of lesson

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,670
and wealth inequality so what you're

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:58,150
looking here is an income map by block

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:59,920
in Chicago bye-bye residential block

00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:05,350
so these are straights these little

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,820
buildings the black squares are you know

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,279
what is that under five dollars or

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:14,380
something five or less and then the blue

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,850
is five to ten orange in a so on so what

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,850
this is actually called technically as a

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,990
choropleth map but Florence Kelley was

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,200
one of the first people to actually use

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:29,350
this technology mapping technology to

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:31,420
really advance social political cause so

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,490
it's technically brilliant mapping so

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,490
don't let Jon Snow get all the credit

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,440
okay I'm not kidding but if you want you

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:45,089
to learn more about women and mapping

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:49,270
which you should you can follow this QR

00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:52,870
codes so you know nothing Jon Snow

00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:56,440
whatever okay so mapping tech from print

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:58,480
to the web so what is a web map composed

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,430
of well first we have a base map which

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,010
is stat map it's always present it's

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:06,490
sort of a contextualise er it Orient's

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:09,160
the viewer to you know where it is in

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,650
space so streets you know streets and

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,330
bridges and rivers and bodies of water

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,950
and parks and things like that so these

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,980
are all this typically what it based now

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,089
these are just sort of general terms but

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,010
then you have sort of you know

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,750
everything else on top of it so you have

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:27,209
data layers so these are these are the

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:32,320
sort of maybe local points of your map

00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:34,750
polygons lines points yeah so what's

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,050
waitressing was also and Zola you have

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:40,000
you know the light gray and blue it's

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,310
sort of a contextual map of like this is

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,570
actually Manhattan just to orient you

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,880
but then you can turn on these data

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,260
layers which always a colorful kind of

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,709
looks like a bowl of fruit loops a bit

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:56,200
to look out for um that's that so recent

00:13:50,709 --> 00:14:00,190
technologies we have our GS digital maps

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,800
and our GS r GS was is still around

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,190
still widely used but I would say maybe

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,570
in the 90s it was pioneer in providing

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,620
wide

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,650
widespread commercial access to

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,980
to digital mapping but you can put it on

00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:19,550
the web so that was a problem so in 1996

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,780
MapQuest launched its web service you

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,720
know it's great because you can actually

00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:27,470
you know what the directions online and

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,110
all that stuff the problem was it wasn't

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,300
very user friendly so every sort of Pam

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,920
every zoom every time we needed to move

00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:39,700
around the map triggered a full page

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:43,150
reload okay so here we enter the tile so

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,610
what are we looking at here

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:49,280
finally you didn't you could finally use

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,290
a map using tile based technology you

00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,390
can finally use a map without a

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,680
triggering full page reload which is

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,550
exciting because it's a much better user

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,550
experience

00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,990
those are very cool technology so how

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,510
does this work so there's all sorts of

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,790
like we call these like slippy maps so

00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,740
Google Maps you know these are these are

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,840
this is a typical colloquial term for it

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,460
so Google Maps is one example

00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:32,870
you know there's Open Street Map there's

00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:34,400
number map with sorry that is it alright

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,890
so how does this actually work like I

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,900
was saying tiles these are really just

00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:42,190
images they're just images that

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:46,730
JavaScript sort of you know deal like it

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:49,340
coordinates Mouse gestures and Mouse

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,720
events with positioning of these small

00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,720
images on the screen so if you actually

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,190
inspect a slippy map you can see there's

00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,800
all just tiles there associate these all

00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:04,820
just images on a grid cats whatever

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:09,830
everyone likes that so image based tiles

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:13,370
have limitations so what does that mean

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:16,940
so you know sometimes you know imagery

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:18,950
style it must be generated a server it

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,590
you know it's it has limited

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,480
interactivity so you can't actually do

00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:25,190
on this on the fly style

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,769
some approaches they get around that

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:31,730
they're a little esoteric now I'm gonna

00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:34,610
do that so it's a sort of solution to

00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:37,910
that you can now serve tile information

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,940
inspector data it means we have dynamic

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:44,240
interactions we can we can you know

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,610
change you know coloring of things and

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,649
style and zoom and suddenly in the Jeff

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,350
you're seeing here or actually switching

00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:55,730
between a point representation of data

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:58,250
and a polygon representation of data and

00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,980
also notice that it using vector tile

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,360
things we're rendering this using

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,709
something called a box GL which actually

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:09,890
hooks into the metal of the graphics

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,839
processing unit computer so it's very

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:16,839
fast rendering this is actually what

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:19,669
Google Maps the web after useless now so

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,589
in addition to just being able to do the

00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:25,189
styling the the vector tiles also

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,689
include all the data so you know what

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:30,590
you're looking at here is probably a

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:33,049
choropleth of percent foreign foreign

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:36,290
air percent sorry percent of population

00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:37,790
under 16 i'm switching between here the

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,160
different sort of different core

00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,960
mappings at different statistics the

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,750
reason that these can be rendered and

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,730
styled on-the-fly is that all the data

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:53,299
is actually present inside the vector

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:59,419
title itself so how are tiles made so we

00:17:53,299 --> 00:18:03,440
go do we have here are sorry we have a

00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:05,240
three cylindrical map projection this is

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,429
a little yes so there was a livable map

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:13,400
projection we are able to project a you

00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:17,480
know globe onto a flat surface so this

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,840
leads to obvious distortion you can all

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,370
remember middle school geography class

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,680
it's problems so there are lots of

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:30,520
different ways of projecting things

00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:34,090
and but for our purposes we use a

00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,880
projection called when Mark ater good to

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,280
know but to break it down a little bit

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,660
assume that in the tiling and tiling

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,630
something assumed out the world is a

00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:47,650
square may feel that way sometimes it's

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:51,210
really not so for zoom level 0 we have

00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:54,640
one tile for the world but soom level 1

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,560
there are 4 tiles so you close sort of

00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:03,030
if you're if you're trying to zoom and

00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:06,310
you kind of get more title so zoom 0 1 2

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:10,180
you get more titles so that's the attic

00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:11,410
to think about as sort of a pyramid good

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,860
visuals so that's all they're all good

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,210
to know another common format probably I

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,920
don't assignment

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,380
another common format is it's actually

00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,780
probably what most people should use for

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,900
most problems I would think geotextile

00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:28,690
um so do you do sounds good for smaller

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:37,660
datasets it's good for just being able

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:41,380
to sorry that's my uber no so Gio JSON

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:45,160
it's it's good for smaller datasets it's

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,570
good for really quick quick and easy

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,630
things basically like this with a full

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,630
the full spatial data is is downloaded

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:55,960
into the browser so you know if if you

00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:58,000
have a very large data set it's not

00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,200
gonna work but for most use cases you

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,450
really get away to use liaison that's

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,590
fine

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:06,490
so what is Gio Jason it's just

00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:11,310
opinionated JSON format for for storing

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:18,730
spatial data so think of it as JSON API

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:19,570
but geography map data so kind of

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:24,130
putting it all together

00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:26,020
whoa ok a lot of stuff going on here all

00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:30,010
of this really could just do mapping

00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:32,740
well not always but I would say that for

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,470
most most use cases the Geo JSON

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,450
approach

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,970
mapping sin with simplegeo Jason is

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,370
gonna work just fine but for a more

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,220
complicated map mapping technologies

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,750
this is how it works

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:50,039
and I would say for Zola this is how

00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:52,500
this is pretty much exactly how we kind

00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:55,650
of deal with rendering and storing and

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,570
maintaining all of that data so that's a

00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,730
lot of stuff but we don't just build it

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:03,120
from the ground out there are these

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,179
things called cloud services Cardo is is

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,659
one of them I really like Cardo because

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:12,570
it is truly open source we actually did

00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:13,679
run Cardo to power source backing up a

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,970
bit like what does it actually do it

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,880
takes care of everything you see in the

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,309
red red circle there it takes care of

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,980
all of that so the reason I like it so

00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:24,960
much is that like I was saying you can

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,630
run it you're on infrastructure is truly

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,679
open source and we actually did do that

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,120
you know there's a lot of companies I

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,940
talked to big talk about you know like

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:36,090
it's open source you can rent this we

00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,860
actually delivered live services on top

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,510
of it for over here and we just we just

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,320
didn't want to maintain you know

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:45,750
upgrades to it and once we you know but

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,940
really like how it shows how it's like

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,620
the opposite like instead of paying for

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,610
a service and then figuring out well

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,320
it's open source I'm just gonna run this

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,510
myself we actually got the office

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,210
expense we were running at ourselves we

00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:00,919
proved the value of it and then you know

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:05,309
we run a lot of applications on it stone

00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:08,549
so sorry backing up but I would say

00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:10,200
Cardo is great but it's not you don't if

00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:11,549
you're just trying to show a point on a

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,039
map you don't necessarily need to use

00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:16,980
Cardo Cardo would be overkill for that

00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:19,320
all it was vehicle accessibility all

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:23,039
right so yes

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:26,549
maps are obviously intended as a sort of

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,730
visual tools that doesn't mean that they

00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:35,460
can't be described as mean that persons

00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:38,070
who depend on accessibility tooling or

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,710
visually impaired doesn't mean that they

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:44,279
can't also be

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,679
enjoying and using mass the south so we

00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,690
can still still work on this we can

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,539
still do a lot better so one thing to

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,770
consider when doing accessibility is to

00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:58,950
use leaflet jazz the reason for that is

00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,970
it's all SVG based so you know some of

00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,679
the maps I was showing you earlier or

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:06,809
WebGL base what that means that there is

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,309
a little canvas element and that's all

00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:10,380
there's just a canvas element you don't

00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:13,220
get you don't get all these nodes in the

00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,320
Dom so you can actually can't actually

00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:20,340
put our information on them so with SVG

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,559
base mapping like leaflet you can you

00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,730
can put area information on there

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,309
because you get all those dominoes it's

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,649
really nice I'm gonna say my books you

00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:30,299
know this canvas base you just get

00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:34,320
canvas is really hard to make it

00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:35,700
accessible that said there is a add on

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,950
comic books you know accessibility which

00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,360
I work you know I didn't build that I'm

00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,270
trying to contribute more to you I

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,590
encourage everyone to take a look at

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:47,640
this it's a really cool problem to work

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:52,440
on yeah so basically the way it works is

00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:57,270
you have your city campus based dom node

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:58,789
there and then on the other side you you

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,679
know you can have sort of a shadow

00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:03,510
representation of what's happening in in

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,059
the map and it's all invisible but it

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,640
has it's all sort of dom representation

00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,200
of you know maybe i have like five

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,880
points or six points or something I'll

00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,230
have six dominoes for those things and

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,000
I'll put some information on them so

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,240
that you know and then you keep these

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,520
two things in sync and then it really

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,130
really makes things a lot nicer there's

00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,330
still a lot of work to be done so if

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,809
you're really interested I would check

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,490
out my box GL accessibility it's a

00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:31,350
pretty cool problem to work on we should

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:35,460
we should make these awesome Mouse

00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:37,200
accessible right so case study Zola back

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,230
to Zola talked about that a lot not the

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,289
marriage app wedding I'm sorry basic

00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:47,039
features many many many data layers map

00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:49,770
state preserved and URL layer Styles

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,170
shared across another house monthly data

00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:54,000
updates

00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,040
so we need all of these things so so

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,890
what does that mean its way the easiest

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:02,880
way to jump in for us was to use number

00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:05,370
nine important informatics GL right so

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,730
what is this it's simply a bindings

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:11,550
layer on top of the core matte box g LJ

00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:16,590
s library so it provides you know really

00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:18,120
nice declarative developer experience so

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:22,440
kind of breaking down what we're looking

00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,990
at here aligns on line three we have a

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,290
sort of outer or matte box component

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:31,650
this is what's actually building that

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:35,400
canvas element it's initializing all the

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:38,130
map stuff it's you know nothing's really

00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,560
in it yet unless you've told it so a

00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:43,020
base map will be in it but nothing else

00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,110
is really in it no data layers are quite

00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:49,550
in it just yet but that's what for and

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:53,160
it lines four and five too so like for

00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:55,950
you pass in again you see this geo JSON

00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,720
type and then you pass in the actual geo

00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:01,410
takes on data so that's what the model

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,270
is gonna be isn't geo JSON data yeah I

00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:06,360
mean this you know if you look at the

00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,910
Geo json specification any need your

00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,670
jason you pass them to this now flex geo

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:14,400
it's going to understand it and then you

00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:16,440
have this other contextual component on

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,390
my five called source not later and

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,880
that's you know that's more responsible

00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,250
for the visual so styling of of that

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,100
data so mapped out source is all the

00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:29,790
data behind behind the stuff source

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,870
layer is the styling of stuff in the

00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:37,650
sort of paint property you see there

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:40,710
adheres to matte box Geo's styling

00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:43,260
specification so it's you know all of

00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:46,110
this was pretty the member makkac she

00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:50,010
had on tries to of course get as close

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:52,620
to whatever the underlying map box based

00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:57,779
API this is happening

00:26:52,620 --> 00:27:03,000
right so it's a problem to sibling

00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:04,890
components who depend on you know the

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,279
same state of something so for example I

00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:12,809
want to turn on that zoning districts

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:15,870
layer there so there's information about

00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:19,080
zoning districts such as a state such as

00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:20,669
whether it's on that the map needs to

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,190
know about in the Memphis meant many

00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:26,149
ways know about so when we got around

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,710
this is how do we you know so yeah state

00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:30,299
sharing state across hidden components

00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:34,590
so one way we got around with this is

00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:38,669
passing in the layer passing down a sort

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:42,360
of layer configuration model so multiple

00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:45,090
models for each layer passed down to

00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,620
both components since these are data

00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,950
models they they have their own internal

00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,240
state and the menu can reference it and

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,210
then the map component can reference

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,490
sample keeps a UI Satan sync we don't

00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:00,450
have a bunch of weird like you know

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:02,750
event buses and stuff like that that you

00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:06,870
know this is one way of doing it so

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:08,580
anatomy of the map component so you know

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,740
when we first started this you know you

00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,240
notice that there are several widgets

00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,649
there are several things going on you

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,820
know they have a print button you have a

00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:21,419
measure tool you have a draw tool if you

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:24,899
know all sorts of stuff going on so our

00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:27,360
first draft of the map component was

00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:31,980
very very very very long

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,440
I think this Jeff goes to like maybe 400

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,470
or 500 lines which probably isn't that

00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,330
bad the grand scheme of things but it

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:42,270
actually it was actually interesting

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,740
because in this case instead of you know

00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:48,179
reaching for what could have been the

00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,559
wrong obstruction meaning assuming that

00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:51,610
we know the future and that we're going

00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:53,170
to need this thing

00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,460
as it feels like we'll probably and

00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,770
that'll be cool and convenient to have

00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,230
that thing instead of reaching for that

00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,750
we really allowed this sort of

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:05,730
components class or weapon a little more

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:09,790
before we jumped into refactoring it so

00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:11,590
so finally after it was ready kind of it

00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,510
was getting too long and unwieldy we

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,910
need to refactor so he really knew what

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,710
the problem was now we can start

00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:22,350
grouping things together so highlighting

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:24,370
feature highlighted it highlighted

00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:27,790
visual feedback so whenever the mouse

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,440
hovers over a part of the map and you

00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:31,150
want that visual view back all those

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,840
concerns can be grouped together put it

00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:37,059
in a component you know the draw tool so

00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,480
being able to you know draw measure

00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:42,040
stuff so all the handling for putting

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,070
the things on the map when you draw a

00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,429
little if Mouse events all of the you

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:51,480
know little calculations and text and

00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:55,150
being able to switch between the unit

00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,559
take it put in a component you know a

00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:01,480
visual feedback for whatever you select

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,790
something so again component so one

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,970
thing I think to take from this is when

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:09,280
in doubt make a new component you know

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:13,059
one it's it's always scary to kind of

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:16,750
you know start creating a new classes or

00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:20,200
something but do you think you know you

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:22,140
can really easily clean up a lot of a

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,140
lot of code and a lot of complexity by

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,140
simply

00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:38,529
okay so line two for example what we

00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:43,659
have here is the measurement widget we

00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:48,039
simply pass down the map into that layer

00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:50,049
widget and all the layer concerns happen

00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:51,759
their line for measurement widget passed

00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,469
down the map it's really just sort of

00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,149
separating concerns and just giving

00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:56,950
things their dependencies at the early

00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:58,690
need understanding what those

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:05,049
dependencies are all these things depend

00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:06,940
on map instance so it makes it easier to

00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:11,859
test makes it easier to choose sort of

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:15,849
split out things right so lesson here

00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:20,259
don't abstract you soon and well this is

00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:24,279
the next session next section tests it's

00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:26,049
really hard to test Maps you're how do

00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,489
you even an acceptance test live

00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:32,649
geocanvas you don't I mean I've tried

00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:35,200
it's scary all right so you you know you

00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:36,579
have all these click events you have at

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,399
least hover events you want to make sure

00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:43,089
that visual feedback is happening you

00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:45,609
want to make sure that you know you're

00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:48,359
not going backwards on certain behavior

00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:51,190
things are turning on they shouldn't be

00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:54,249
you know this is this is all really hard

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:57,519
to deal with WebGL cameras but what you

00:31:54,249 --> 00:32:02,679
can do is use elaborate stowe what is a

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:04,929
stub stub is a sort of a mock it's all

00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,249
sort of loosey-goosey terms I think some

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:10,329
people have tried to really define them

00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:13,989
probably computer science journal

00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:15,039
articles can you know very clearly talk

00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:18,719
about what that means we're really a

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:22,419
stub is just a fake class that you are

00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:25,659
using to mock a certain behavior so

00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:29,480
instead of using a real map you could

00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:31,760
use a fake class and just assume

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,010
that the underlying thing works so how

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,190
do you step out dependency injection

00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:39,380
another probably pattern all that means

00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,900
all that means is because we've broken

00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,630
things out a little bit more we have our

00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,620
Matt box basic map component line one

00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:50,420
here

00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:55,810
and our testing environment through some

00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:59,330
of embers test tooling we can stub in a

00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:02,180
yeah we can we can we can stub in the

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:05,420
map instance so instead of that

00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:09,410
component yielding out a real matte box

00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:12,410
jam map like it just you know yields an

00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:15,590
instance we can stub it and then had it

00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:17,990
kind of dummy object and all of these

00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:19,340
methods here at layer outsource get

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:25,220
source these are all actually matte box

00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:27,160
GL API methods I have seen some matte

00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:32,390
box geo add-ons

00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:34,720
use elaborate steps for this reason it's

00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:37,340
not always the best thing in the world

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,890
but it has worked really well for us

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,860
another tricky part is in a box GL is

00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:45,230
event-driven so you know how do you

00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:48,170
simulate a mouse and move event an

00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:50,000
underlying matte box GL detects math

00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,520
mouths move and then it you know it

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,200
triggers the callback for you know your

00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,770
apps handling for what happens when a

00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:01,130
mouse moves you know I was what

00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:02,570
something has worked for us is to use

00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:07,190
something like what we're seeing here

00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:09,409
which is just manually within your test

00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:12,890
actually trigger that behavior and give

00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:15,140
the callbacks signature that you know is

00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:18,440
needed for whatever your your own apps

00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,669
callback function is so you know this

00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,929
way you're actually triggering the

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:25,310
behavior now and testing it but real

00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,720
Chuck you know this has worked really

00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,780
well for us but you're really not

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,490
supposed to mock what you don't

00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:35,980
so you know I don't love I don't love

00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:37,839
this solution but it has it has you know

00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:40,149
in the absence of any testing this is

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,579
working really well I think ideally in

00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:45,520
the future we go back to Mad Max GL

00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:48,369
accessibility actually in building out

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,839
that add-on will really help us deal

00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:54,970
with using real Mouse events using real

00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:57,880
clicks to actually test behavior on the

00:34:54,970 --> 00:35:01,960
map so but we need to build that out

00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:04,060
first but also yeah seriously so like

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,160
don't mock what you don't home is it's

00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,680
the general advice but lets you know

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:14,470
where it can be reasonable so no more

00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:16,329
aggressions we hope yeah all right so

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:21,460
what great power comes really go maps

00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:22,930
how to lie with maps so I'm kind of this

00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,270
is the very important message I wanted

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:29,800
to add which is maps are very powerful

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:31,960
rhetorical tools they are things that

00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,550
everyone sort of identifies with we

00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,300
identify the place you can point where

00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:40,750
you live

00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:43,260
we've been on the map and you know what

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:47,710
I'd like this quote a lot because it's

00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:50,560
you know map users you know we we kind

00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,720
of just kind of just assumed entrusted

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,900
the map we've trust maps exists or you

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,329
trusted map is a representation of

00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,630
reality so this is an example this is a

00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:06,040
great example of how you know how easy

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:09,460
it is to rhetorically misinterpret a map

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:14,140
so what you're seeing on the left there

00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:21,069
is a recent presidential election so

00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:24,970
these are how people voted sorry it's

00:36:21,069 --> 00:36:29,230
probably loaded yeah so on the left

00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:33,010
there you're looking at the election

00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:37,230
results by county but if you normalize

00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:40,690
the election results by population

00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,080
distribution you actually get a totally

00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:45,130
different

00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:47,890
sure actually looks much closer than you

00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,530
could understand and the other in the

00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:52,450
other one and there was one map in this

00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:56,950
slide that you're seeing that was shared

00:36:52,450 --> 00:37:03,850
a lot by one party and I won't get into

00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:07,060
that but this is a great xkcd he or

00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:11,650
something I don't know it's really just

00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:16,750
my biggest pet peeve also is you know

00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:18,520
you can just spatial correlation doesn't

00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,950
mean that there's actually a real

00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,170
relationship between these things most

00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:25,660
of it's just a function of population so

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:31,540
we can see for example in his Twitter

00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:33,880
data tweet you know this is in 2013

00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:38,500
there's a lot of excitement web mapping

00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:41,560
was much more accessible possible to use

00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:44,530
mapping mapping tools a lot of that

00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,510
hashtag mapped thing a lot of McDonald's

00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,490
being mapped but you'll see that they

00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:54,580
these are largely just function with

00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:57,910
population density so the Twitter data

00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:01,810
is map there is tweets during the

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:05,260
election and then there is population

00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:09,840
density so I mean I love looking at cool

00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:12,460
map but it's you know it's it's between

00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:16,510
rhetorically dishonest or just not that

00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:19,060
interesting that's okay you know another

00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:21,460
thing and augmenting a message through

00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:23,710
maps there's obviously graphic design

00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,930
choices that could be made you know you

00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:29,380
have this on the Left we're talking

00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:33,930
about you know gun death I have you know

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:38,650
raging epidemic it's black and red and

00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:40,750
crosshair on it and and then bottom left

00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,120
actually what you see is these sort of

00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:47,320
granular bins so it creates a lot more

00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,790
like kind of I don't know visual no not

00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,050
yeah

00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:55,180
noise I guess makes it just look kind of

00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:58,420
grisly or on the right you have the

00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:02,820
opposite rhetorical angle you know the

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:04,870
title fewer bins on the bottom left you

00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,400
know and you're just scrap not

00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,880
describing his violent deaths you're

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,800
describing us it's intense

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,990
incidents per you know hundred thousand

00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,080
or something these are choices that you

00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:21,070
can think so yeah so thank you all for

00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,930
joining me in my apartment I the city

00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,450
I'm learning as a lot of us are working

00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:27,250
from home now um never thought that

00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:31,240
would happen but um yeah thank you so

00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:35,940
much please reach out on discord if you

00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,940
