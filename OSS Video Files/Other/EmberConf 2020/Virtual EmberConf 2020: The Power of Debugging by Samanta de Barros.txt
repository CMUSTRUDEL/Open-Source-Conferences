	The Power of Debugging by Samanta de Barros

Several tools can help us when trying to find a bug in our code, knowing them can be a very helpful skill. But finding bugs is not the only thing we can get from debugging.

In this talk, we’ll walk through a series of challenges, and aided by the different debugging tools at our disposal, we will not only fix the issues we have but also learn about Ember, how an Ember app is structured and how to find what you’re looking for, even in production code.
