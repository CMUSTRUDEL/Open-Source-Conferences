Description: 
	Shift Left by Melanie Sumner

In this talk, we’ll look at both patterns and anti-patterns, consider how we can “shift left” in our own development practice, and consider how we can take that this accessibility journey—together.

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,000
hello everyone my name is Melanie Sumner

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,700
I work on accessibility and number at

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,190
LinkedIn before I start I want to give a

00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,379
huge shout out to our community and the

00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,019
way everyone is making the best of a not

00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:39,970
great situation I think that together

00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:43,210
framework proves once again that we

00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,160
really are all in this together today I

00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,830
want to talk to us about the shift left

00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,510
mindset and how I think this will not

00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,970
only improve the quality of your

00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,390
codebase but help you level up in your

00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,430
craft my son brought home some coding

00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,890
homework the other week as you can

00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,710
probably imagine I got really excited

00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,070
I've been leaving him little hints like

00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,140
casually placing code for kids and

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,450
anyone can code kind of books around the

00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,400
house where he could see them or taking

00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,790
photos of my book collection and showing

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,900
him how many likes that got on Instagram

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,939
anyway his homework was the kind of

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,850
light bar code game learned about

00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,469
procedures loops and conditionals while

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,320
helping a character move around the map

00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:31,149
and turn lights on and off I helped him

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,060
get through his homework but naturally

00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:36,030
since he's 13 and it was homework he

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,890
wasn't as excited about it as I'd been

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,079
it got me thinking about when I learned

00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:44,469
how to code and how other people learn

00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:47,249
how to code what about you how did you

00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:50,380
learn I've seen a few different paths

00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:52,149
maybe it's your hobby maybe you went to

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,490
college and earned a degree in computer

00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:56,469
science maybe you did something else

00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,200
first and decided to switch careers

00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:02,109
through a coding bootcamp or maybe

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,420
you're self-taught all of these ways are

00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:06,579
great but they are inevitably incomplete

00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,440
when you're building for the web if the

00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:11,410
past 31 years of the web have taught us

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,900
anything is that change is constant and

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,090
that means any learning path you choose

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,330
is inevitably going to leave something

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,940
out this is especially true when it

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,370
comes to crafting accessible experiences

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,840
for the web it ends up being kind of

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,480
tricky if you're trying to interview

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,010
folks to fill positions an interview

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,610
process needs to be efficient for the

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,360
company

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,310
but some

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,320
time's the efficiency measures taken for

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,000
the business reasons can really leave

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,010
out all the things that we need to be

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,650
checking for when hiring front-end

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,960
developers I'm sure we've all seen a

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,210
social media posts about whiteboarding

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,130
algorithms during an interview I'll need

00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,560
to end up with a daily work that is more

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,140
about making forms and vertically

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,550
centering elements on the screen so I'm

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,890
not going to get into the interview

00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,630
process at this point but I think it's

00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,700
an area that really needs to change in

00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,670
our industry so let's keep that dialogue

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:07,510
going in other spaces but right now

00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:12,070
let's talk about where what we can do

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:14,709
where we already work now today what are

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,790
the practical steps that we can take to

00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:21,340
elevate the craft of the front end

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:24,040
continuous learning is a must and I

00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,650
don't mean in a theoretical sense there

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,230
is always something new to learn for

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,140
front-end web development and excellence

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,880
goes beyond lines of code and to be

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,610
clear I don't think that there's just

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,590
one way to do this I think it really

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,239
depends on the part of the stack that

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,360
you're focused on and what your

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,549
interests and goals are for example if

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,110
you have a computer science degree but

00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:49,510
you're building UI components for a

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,900
living additional study will likely be

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,730
necessary in user experience and design

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,670
if you're a bootcamp trained developer

00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,959
who finds themselves writing tools

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,390
additional computer science study will

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,209
likely be necessary to improve the tools

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:06,310
you create and no matter what kind of

00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:08,890
education you've gotten you will likely

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,790
need to study assistive technology since

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,410
it's not included in most curriculum an

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,709
example of this in another field is in

00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:22,180
soccer or football if you name things

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:23,880
correctly typically players will develop

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,890
the basic skill sets of the game

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,460
endurance ball handling game strategy

00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:32,500
then players will find their niche the

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,100
kind of position they like to play such

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:40,930
as offense or defense in an area of the

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:43,030
pitch left right or center as a result

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,950
you can end up with different play

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,490
styles or career tracks if you

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:50,110
well I've identified three there's a

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,600
kind of player that develops as an

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,270
all-around player on either offense or

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,620
defense but can play on any area of the

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:02,110
pitch in this case we have an attacking

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,350
midfielder who can also play left-wing

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,000
or right-wing he can do them all

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,460
sometimes even after they've trained for

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,040
their niche a coach can act ask them to

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:15,640
switch things up and a left back becomes

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,740
a left wing instead some players develop

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,830
their niche and stay with it no matter

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,190
what kit they're wearing no matter what

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,540
kind of developer you are think about

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,610
the position you're playing right now

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,670
and further develop your skill set

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,950
accordingly some percentage of your time

00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,650
must involve either deeper knowledge of

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,090
the niche you are already in or

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,040
balancing out your skirt skill set by

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,700
increasing the knowledge of the domains

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,160
that will be affected by your work the

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,680
next time you are at work for every UI

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,020
component for every workflow that we

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,030
write code for we must be asking

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,360
ourselves questions that will help us

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,510
keep our users in mind would I enjoy

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,700
this user experience could I perform

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,100
this workflow with my eyes closed

00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,040
could I still complete this workflow

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,080
with only my keyboard if I blurred my

00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,510
vision and looked at the screen could I

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,900
still tell where the focus our outlines

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:16,030
are as I tab through the interface if I

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,320
pulled this up on my mobile device what

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,590
happens when I have the accessibility

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,860
settings turned on do I know what this

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,990
looks like in high contrast mode for

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,380
every new feature request that comes in

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,630
do a quick self check do you know how

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,420
that new feature request will affect

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,010
your user experience

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,540
please especially think about that the

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:41,050
next time you start to engage with a

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,540
designer on a new feature so what do

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,690
good patterns look like when we think

00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,500
about patterns what comes to mind a

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,320
typical pattern looks something like

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,200
this basic examples that show how to use

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,780
it variations on the basic examples to

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,640
show some flexibility a rendered sample

00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,600
of the pattern so you can get an idea of

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,110
what it should look like

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,200
and some way to copy the code so you can

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,330
paste it into your own IDE these

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,030
patterns are typical but I believe they

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,710
are missing the essentials maybe you

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,900
think that it's someone else's job to

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,660
consider performance which really can

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,120
help rationalize any given number of

00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,980
realities we face on a daily basis poor

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,390
management and general accessibility

00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,930
ignorance even sometimes our own

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:28,510
laziness but the thing is even the most

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,550
concise framework code in the world will

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,640
not matter if we're not thinking about

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:37,900
the feature code that we create it might

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,870
be beautiful it might be easy to use but

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,360
if it's missing the expertise say in

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,670
accessibility you can end up with a

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,510
beautiful UI that is completely unusable

00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:52,270
for a percentage of your user base you

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,180
can confirm this with some math what is

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,320
an optimal Dom tree look like less than

00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,280
1,500 nodes

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:03,490
max depth of 32 nodes no parent with

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,820
more than 60 child nodes and there's a

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,790
free add-on idea for you not only will

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,980
the non optimal experience feel sluggish

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:15,520
which really should be enough for us to

00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:18,640
re visit implementation it can also make

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,320
screen readers outright crash if we are

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,930
working on any kind of code that needs

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:27,460
to scale we have to be especially aware

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:29,230
of this so what are we missing we must

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,169
not confuse the quick answer with a

00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,599
complete answer it's not enough to

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,890
provide patterns that tell us what to do

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,300
good patterns will also explain why

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,330
patterns should also include anti

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,270
patterns what not to do and why not to

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,160
do them by investing in the effort to

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,800
create patterns that are the complete

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,440
answer we give ourselves the right tools

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,930
to craft better solutions for our users

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,000
by understanding both the pattern and

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,880
the anti pattern we will know when to

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,340
raise a red flag on a designer prototype

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,590
it helps us to get to the finish line

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,410
instead of stopping at an incomplete

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,150
solution here's the thing if it's not

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,430
accessible then it's not a complete

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,640
solution you're not finished that

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,589
about the problem yet don't stop until

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,570
you get there I've seen too many

00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,250
features need to completely rewrite

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,100
after the fact because they've decided

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,740
to delay the accessibility audits until

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,440
later if you think about accessibility

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,810
as a core requirement your MVP will

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,500
actually be an MVP and not just

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:38,290
technical debt point three stop issue

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,120
sooner by equipping ourselves with a

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,520
more holistic view of our digital

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,580
products we enable ourselves to stop

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,370
issues sooner we can prevent bugs before

00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,440
they even start we can increase the

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,320
percentage of our code base that doesn't

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,060
regress in the first place do you know

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,399
how many accessibility issues your

00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:01,570
product haves if you don't know do you

00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,730
know how to find out hint if you happen

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,339
to be one of my colleagues it's possible

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,770
to find out another thing that we have

00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:11,440
in our corner as developers are tools in

00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:13,750
some cases they might be tools we're

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,180
still trying to create but first let's

00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,040
look at the ones we already have

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,810
we have lending and testing tools that

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,150
can help us before we commit any lines

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,730
of code to the code base in ember we

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:27,250
have two great options for this two of

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,440
these are ember 11y testing and ember

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,380
template lint let's talk about ember

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,110
template lint in the last six months we

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,850
have been slowly but steadily figuring

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,430
out how to give the ember community

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,980
something special not only is there an

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,020
octane configuration we have also been

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,260
adding more accessibility related rules

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,940
to ember template lint why should you

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,740
make sure it's in your app and that the

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,820
accessibility related rules are turned

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,490
on here's why because by actively using

00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,310
this add-on you benefit from actionable

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,940
insights because you can benefit from

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:07,660
these right from your code editor and we

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,000
even now support IntelliJ you can start

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:14,260
checking for these accessibility issues

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,990
before you commit any code why else

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,690
should you use it because it's okay not

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,430
to know everything it's okay to accept

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,339
that there are things you don't know and

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,810
depend on your tools to help you out the

00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,940
Ember template lint add-on

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,760
provides you with the support for some

00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,410
things you might not even know yet did

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,900
you know that you don't always need to

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:38,080
add alt text images but that the

00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,940
attribute always has to be there did you

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,560
know that you don't have to put image in

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,680
the alt text because the screen reader

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,860
already reads out that it's an image the

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,650
required valid alt text rule will help

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,190
you out there did you know that every

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:56,350
input needs an Associated label did you

00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,330
know that there are valid values for the

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,480
role attribute and that you can't make

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,339
up your own rule or that there are

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,470
different kinds of rules and some of

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,860
them are abstract and must never be

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,080
defined in your code or did you know

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,930
that interactive elements always require

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,790
a roll number template Lynn and Embry

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,610
live in my testing can help you check

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:23,260
these things in your app proactively

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:25,839
generating more elevated quality code

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,080
before you push your code means that we

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,420
can reduce the number of JIRA tickets

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,839
which will give you more time for your

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,790
next big idea I think this is the best

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,400
reason for using ember template lint

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,120
you're giving your future self the gift

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:46,480
of more time to spend on the next idea

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,430
challenge alert Mia wants to know do you

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,400
know what will happen if you ran ember

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,290
template lint on your codebase today try

00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,660
it and see next time you're in your

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,930
codebase run ember template lint and see

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,190
what kind of issues it reports

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,350
accessibility audits will reveal these

00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,380
issues and more so why not take care of

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,330
the ones we know about now we've started

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,070
working on ways to test the common

00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,040
failures and that's something that

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,950
hasn't existed yet as we work out how to

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,480
put these automated tests into place

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:19,089
every Ember developer will be armed with

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,610
better decision-making support from the

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:24,910
moment you start writing code but we

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,830
still have a long way to go some of you

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,900
have heard me referred to accessibility

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:33,430
as a final frontier of the web and

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,140
here's why intent matters accessible

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,140
interfaces are the ones that can be used

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,440
in the way they were intended to be used

00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:42,800
but we still don't have a way

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,070
to say here's the intent of this piece

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,670
of code until we can programmatically

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:52,880
assign intent to our custom code we will

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:55,220
have gaps in our automated testing until

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,620
we have had to look at the full scope of

00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,380
the accessibility test automation

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,000
problem that we face today we will not

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,910
be willing to say this is how you do it

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,270
and this is how you don't and this is

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,610
what I mean about the need to shift left

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,260
don't wait for the audit move

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,620
accessibility into the design and

00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,390
development workflow I genuinely believe

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,670
that understanding the needs of users

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,950
with assistive technology will not only

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,650
show us a clear path forward for the web

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,780
but it will also increase our holistic

00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:29,330
understanding of what our code needs to

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,450
look like in order to create the next

00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:36,920
generation of user experience for every

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:38,930
device here's the thing to me accessible

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,170
code is performance code is valid

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:45,490
semantic code and this kind of code has

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:49,280
a higher degree of quality to it an

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:52,190
elevated level of craft whether you

00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,080
started knowing how to write code with

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,000
these with knowledge about these kind of

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,480
quality standards it should be your

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,510
eventual goal I want you to I wanted you

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,490
to try something when you get home set a

00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,740
meeting on your calendar or an alarm on

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,830
your phone something that allows you to

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,620
set up a weekly check-in take a little

00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,660
time for some self-reflection did you

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,380
have a today I learned moment this week

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,550
if you didn't figure out why challenge

00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:24,430
yourself to make this idea happen

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:28,510
keeping the today I learned mindset is

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,510
essential for success in our field

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,589
maybe you do this by reading a new book

00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:39,720
maybe you do this through daily

00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:42,779
challenge exercises to warm up in the

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,809
morning maybe you do this by trying out

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:48,420
some assistive tech features assistive

00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:52,019
tech on features as you build them maybe

00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,149
you do this by reading the spec or maybe

00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:57,870
you do this by thinking about what spec

00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:59,699
doesn't exist yet beneath Stu I asked

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,759
someone once what the difference was

00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:05,999
between Java and JavaScript and I got an

00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,889
answer I really liked Java versions are

00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:10,709
java's way to become more spec

00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:13,379
conformant while javascript is still

00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:16,259
evolving and design deciding what that

00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:19,319
specification should look like this

00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:22,259
means that until the web platform as a

00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:24,449
whole is a lot more stable we will be

00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:27,660
required to continually grow our

00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:29,939
knowledge and skills I hope I'm not like

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,480
the one breaking this news to you but

00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:36,509
our chosen career path requires passion

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,819
patience and persistence whether or not

00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:41,910
developing the shift left mindset

00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:44,879
appeals to you you can still try turning

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,339
on ember template link today and if you

00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,249
want to get involved in help there are a

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,980
few ways that you can contribute use

00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:55,740
ember template lint and ember a 11y

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,290
testing when you write code contribute

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,889
to these code bases by filing issues for

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,770
bugs or requesting new features or join

00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:06,569
the accessibility strike team

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:09,539
the thing is conference talks can be

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:11,490
really inspiring they call on us to

00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:14,069
imagine the future to show us the

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,799
bleeding edge of tech and inspire us to

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:18,870
reach for excellence but what happens

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,669
when we go back to work the next day and

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:23,819
we're faced with the reality of the

00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:26,149
codebase we work in figuring out how to

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,329
turn that conference inspiration into

00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:30,539
reality

00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:33,419
can be really challenging reality is

00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:36,380
usually a bummer the great news is is

00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:40,289
that we can influence that new reality

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,600
accessibility is a journey and embers in

00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:44,200
it together mindset will make this

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,000
journey easy

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,520
we can carry this weight together and

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,120
together craft a more accessible future

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,210
for all of us thank you for the gift of

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,360
your time and attention and here's where

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,429
to find me on the internet and github

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,990
