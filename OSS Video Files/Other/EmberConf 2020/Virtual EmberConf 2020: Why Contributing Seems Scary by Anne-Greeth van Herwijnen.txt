	Why Contributing Seems Scary by Anne-Greeth van Herwijnen

Contributing to an open-source repository might seem scary for a lot of reasons. Maybe you just started with the framework, language or with software development in general. Maybe it is intimidating to try and jump into a project when others are already so invested and knowledgeable. However, contributing to Ember should be something that is accessible to everyone. In this talk I would like to tell my own story of how I became an Ember contributor. Drawing from scientific research, I will show how the community could make it easier for others to get involved.

[Music]

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,460
good morning good evening good afternoon

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,470
or good night depending on in which time

00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,610
zone you're currently watching this live

00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,680
stream of eMERCOM 2020 I'm I'm afraid

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,140
and I'm going to tell you something

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,140
today about contributing and why it may

00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,809
seem scary and to be honest this is

00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,330
quite scary recording this talk but I'm

00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:48,580
doing it anyway because I really want to

00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:51,820
share my excitement about the topic of

00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,729
contributing but first something more

00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,750
about me I started studying psychology

00:00:54,729 --> 00:01:01,239
here and ends today in 2010 I started

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,790
doing my psychology bachelor's degree

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,040
and after that I completed my master's

00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:11,170
in human media interaction mostly

00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:13,450
focused on user centered design after

00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,790
that I started working at a company

00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,220
called native just half an hour drive

00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,140
from here where I started with a

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,600
traineeship the goal of the traineeship

00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:25,359
was to become a software developer and

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,509
that's what I am today I'm a rails

00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,369
developer doing a lot of CoffeeScript

00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,640
because we use a lot of server-side

00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:36,729
render templates currently we're moving

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,579
towards something more modern using a

00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:42,820
JavaScript framework and the JavaScript

00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:46,299
framework is view a lot of you would

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,119
have expected ember but that's not the

00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:53,049
case I'm not a number developer nor do I

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,969
do any ember coding in my spare time but

00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:59,530
I ended up doing some contributing

00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:01,719
member and it all started in 2018 when I

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,649
was the Zoe on the left side of this

00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:08,259
ember logo and I ended up volunteering I

00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:11,440
ran around most of the time in a green

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:13,330
shirt and during a few lunch breaks in a

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,580
Zoe suit and I have to say running

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,090
around in his OE suit has been the

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:22,420
hardest contributing I've done so far if

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:26,440
we fast-forward approximately 11 months

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:29,740
we end up in Brussels at FOSDEM FOSDEM

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,450
is a large open-source conference with

00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,560
over 8,000 people

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:38,530
attending and over 800 talks that year I

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,780
joined the open source design room

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,690
because design was really something that

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,180
I liked and thought that I could

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,760
understand all the people there were

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,340
really passionate about their

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,319
contribution to open source and what I

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,590
found out was that their contribution

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,110
was not only not technical but it was

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,260
valued so I decided I wanted to

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,549
contribute to a framework that I knew

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,819
with people that I thought could help me

00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:13,420
so two weeks later I opened my first

00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:15,670
pull request it was for ember and it was

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,810
for the release blog and luckily I had

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:24,430
some help this guy helped me a lot with

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:29,319
my PR even though my PR is only four

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:33,160
lines of code I was luckily able to copy

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:35,470
and paste a lot from the RFC just

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,819
copying this and these four lines of

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,549
code they didn't make it any less

00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:45,880
valuable it ended up on the Ember map

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:48,609
screencast of ember octane and after the

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,680
encouragement I got from Kenneth but

00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:54,220
also other people that read the blog I

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:59,109
decided to write more and since then

00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:02,079
I've been writing a lot of PRS for the

00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:04,120
Ember times next to writing I've also

00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,450
been adding a lot of so he symptoms

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,630
Oersted website the cool thing is that

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,900
this is not really hard it's just four

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,450
or five lines of code but it shows to

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:21,609
everybody who has a dumpster that their

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:24,550
dumpster is value too if we forward to

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:28,630
October I ended up at Mr Fest

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:31,479
after contributing and volunteering at

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:35,020
ember kampf two years in a row I decided

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:37,510
to volunteer at ember fest but next to

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,120
the volunteering I also gave a talk I

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:43,000
gave a lightning talk about contributing

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,470
and that everybody can contribute

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,780
because

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,450
after talking to somebody there who was

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,340
surprised that I wrote for the ember

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,850
times even though I'm not in a core team

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,960
I don't do any amber development I

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,930
realized that it's important that

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,850
everybody realizes their value and what

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:05,520
they can contribute to a framework like

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:10,960
ever so let's talk about contributing

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:14,350
contributing is something that we all

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,330
see different so some of you might see

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,780
contributing as adding and removing

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:24,810
lines of code from a repository others

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:27,930
of you who are like me might view it as

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:31,780
running around in a Zowie suit or

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,970
setting up a meet-up the cool thing is

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,090
there is a specification for this called

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:40,720
the all contributed spec which shows all

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:43,960
the different kinds of country butyl can

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,050
make to your repo story or your

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,940
framework so people who are giving a

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,750
talk even if they're currently recording

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,430
it somewhere they are contributing to

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,160
this but also the people who ask

00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,060
questions on this cord lay eyes of

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:04,360
course a large huge contributor to ember

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:07,240
by making this all possible but there's

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,300
also a reason why people do this there

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,460
are psychological things that we can

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,270
look at and learn from when we want to

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:19,120
entice more people into contributing and

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:22,150
the first of it is motivation motivation

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,720
is really important in understanding why

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,570
people contribute social norms is

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,540
something we can use to get people to

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:34,930
contribute and the community which ember

00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,700
has and is should be really proud of is

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,450
something that keeps people interested

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:43,360
income contributing so let's first look

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,940
at motivation there are two kinds of

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,580
motivation there is intrinsic and

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,580
extrinsic motivation intrinsic

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,160
motivation is something from within

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,120
wanting to help people comes from within

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,210
and is cool intrinsic motivation

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,190
experiencing

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:04,569
evasion might be that your boss wants a

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:06,610
bug fixed the cool thing is that it

00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:09,250
doesn't really matter what kind of

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,220
motivation people have if they do

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:14,770
something from it then they end up with

00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,479
a feeling of satisfaction and the

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:21,370
feeling of satisfaction is something we

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,500
as a community can enlargen if we give

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,889
gratitude to the people who contribute

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,370
if we acknowledge their contributions

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:32,830
they will feel this sense of

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:35,740
satisfaction and when they feel it they

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:40,289
will be more likely to contribute to

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:45,520
Ember the next thing is social norms

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:48,400
social norms is a psychological term

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,880
that we use to describe the situation

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,669
where somebody has some someone's

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,400
something and they say yes so for

00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:59,409
example if Leia asks me to upload to

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,259
Zoe's & Tom search to the website and I

00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:04,720
say yes that's social norms in effect

00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,789
and the cool thing is that if somebody

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,919
asks you to do something you already

00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:12,460
feel encouraged that that person chose

00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:15,900
you so if we as a community invite

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:19,750
people this way to contribute they are

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,580
really likely to do it as well and the

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,310
cool thing is that they then experience

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:28,080
the community and community is really

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:33,880
important with an ember but also with in

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:36,279
the general sense of the society there

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,279
are two kinds of things we can look at

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,560
from a community standpoint and the

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,320
first of all is psychological sense of

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,980
community what this actually means is

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,329
that you feel aligned with a community

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:54,070
because their values match with yours

00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:58,209
and I find some tweets that nicely

00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:00,250
illustrate that so Scot tweeted that the

00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:02,170
principles of the ember community are so

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,810
in line with basic human goodness and

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,390
that things like caring and teaching are

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,910
at the core of a lot of members of the

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,180
community

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,670
this really nicely illustrates

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:19,590
the sense of this psychological sense of

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:22,500
community and just this morning I found

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:26,100
this suite of John who was really sad

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,470
that he couldn't go to America but that

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,770
the fact that we're now able to share

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:37,050
this experience in a virtual world is so

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:38,580
cool this also shows his feeling of the

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,720
sense of community with the Emer

00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,880
community and then just I think two

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,510
hours before I'm recording this I found

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,300
this tweet by Kenneth who's said that he

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:54,480
was going to open up more of his time to

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,790
help people to get contributing and he

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,590
wants to enlarge in psychological sense

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,470
of community for people who getting

00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:05,340
started and the cool thing is it's not

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:07,710
only something that happens online by

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,620
organizing meetups like the Chennai made

00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:13,950
up this hair or by taking a picture with

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,190
all the women at the last ember conf or

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:21,330
by attending ember Kampf last year in

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:23,010
person we get a feeling of this

00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,470
psychological sense of community

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,080
community we get a feeling of the values

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:32,880
that we share with each other and even

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,890
today we have that feeling in a virtual

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,140
world there are a lot of people

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,550
currently watching this live stream

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,130
they're chatting there are people

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,380
watching it in VR and the cool thing is

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,840
that this psychological sense of

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,030
community that we're now experiencing

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,900
and I hope you're experiencing it with

00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:54,060
me too can turn into community

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,430
commitment and the cool thing about

00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:00,390
community commitment is that it's

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:04,500
something that make sure that people

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:07,650
keep contributing luckily a lot of ember

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:12,110
people tweet so I found another tweet to

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:16,200
show you this psychological concept

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,960
Melanie tweeted I'm switching to react

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,990
as an answer to the question what she

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,170
would tweet when she was kidnapped to

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,500
show us what happened and this shows so

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,770
no

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,160
that the identity that melanie has is so

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:34,230
closely linked to amber that we

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,790
immediately would recognize this and

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:40,890
this like community commitment has to do

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,190
with loyalty so people are willing to

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:49,410
exert effort on behalf of this community

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:52,770
people will share their experiences am i

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:55,200
sharing their experiences they make sure

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,660
that they're more likely to keep

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,440
contributing so the cool thing is that

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,600
if we as a community start talking to

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,500
each other and exposing it to the

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,460
outside world

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,890
we're as a community getting tighter so

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,430
what can we learn from what I told you

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,950
to say first of all make sure that you

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:19,710
thank everybody of course this is common

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:22,070
courtesy but be aware of all the people

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,470
that help you when you have an atom or

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,730
when you're organizing a meet-up

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:30,060
make sure that you're not only

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:34,110
acknowledging people who create PR but

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:38,339
also the people that help the PR take

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:41,130
more shape the next thing we as a

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:45,000
community to do is ask people to

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:47,220
contribute to their strengths asking

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,610
someone to contribute will hopefully

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,880
give them a cool sense that they can do

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,500
it but if you ask them to contribute to

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,620
their strengths they're even more likely

00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,230
to feel really satisfied afterwards and

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,050
the last thing I want to encourage all

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,420
of you even if you're now sitting in

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:10,080
your sweatpants at home let's talk about

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:13,080
ember maybe not talk talk like somebody

00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,260
in real life but make a blog or tweet

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:19,620
about it or fight the righteous fight at

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,460
the JavaScript reddit to make ember cool

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,339
there too

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:26,790
but by talking about ember you're

00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:29,310
creating a better community commitment

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:33,270
for yourself but you're also able to ask

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:36,180
and invite people in to join ember so

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,660
this is something that I wanted to share

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,660
with you

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,690
want to tell you to do it it might seem

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,030
scary

00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,610
you might feel really weird at first

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:49,710
talking to people about this thing

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,400
that's really important to you but do it

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:57,330
anyway it's not that hard you can start

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,550
by just creating a PR somewhere or just

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,910
writing a simple blog and as the

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,860
community grows we will be there for you

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,900
just like Kenneth was there for my first

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,040
PR there were a lot of people on this

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:15,690
cord on the gate of repose that will

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,390
