	Why Contributing Seems Scary by Anne-Greeth van Herwijnen

Contributing to an open-source repository might seem scary for a lot of reasons. Maybe you just started with the framework, language or with software development in general. Maybe it is intimidating to try and jump into a project when others are already so invested and knowledgeable. However, contributing to Ember should be something that is accessible to everyone. In this talk I would like to tell my own story of how I became an Ember contributor. Drawing from scientific research, I will show how the community could make it easier for others to get involved.
