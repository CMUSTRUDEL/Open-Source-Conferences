Description: 
	Lessons Learned from Changing Careers by Kara Luton

What do ballet, music publicity and front end engineering have in common? More than you would think. Three years ago I didn't know what a div was but I did know I needed a career change. I stumbled upon the tech world, enrolled in a bootcamp and haven't looked back.

Non-traditional paths are becoming more common place in the tech industry. There are more bootcamp and self-taught devs than ever before. In this talk we'll discuss how I bring my past experiences from two unrelated careers into my current role and why you should consider hiring more devs with non-traditional backgrounds.

[Music]

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,900
hey everyone I'm Kara Luton and today

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,919
I'm going to be talking about how I've

00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,570
changed careers not once but two times

00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:35,920
so I went from being a ballerina and

00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:39,430
pursuing that professionally to working

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,530
as a music publicist in Nashville now I

00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,660
work as a software engineer on the UX

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:47,739
team at crosstrek we're a cyber security

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,330
company aiming to stop breaches it still

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,430
makes me so proud to say that I'm a

00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,690
software engineer and you told me you

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,479
four years ago that's what I'd be doing

00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,059
now I would have laughed I had no idea

00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:01,000
what JavaScript was so I even HTML or

00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:03,010
CSS were I was completely oblivious to

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,220
the tech industry even though it was all

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,990
around me and that's really funny to me

00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,180
now because I'm so immersed in the tech

00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,220
world to give you a little bit more

00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,020
insight into what I do besides working

00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,900
on an awesome product at CrowdStrike I

00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,939
also blog on dev I write articles torts

00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,830
aimed towards beginners and I'm also a

00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:23,619
co organizer for the Nashville woman

00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,479
programmers meetup group my life now

00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:27,549
revolves around the tech industry and

00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,189
I'm really proud of that but I wouldn't

00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:32,409
be here talking to you today if I hadn't

00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:34,960
pursued becoming a ballerina or working

00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:36,249
as a means of kosis first my life has

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,140
really come full circle

00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:40,479
I started out performing in front of an

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,130
audience on stage and Here I am in front

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,539
of an audience again just this time

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:48,850
giving the tech talk my past experiences

00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:50,560
make me the developer I am today those

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,990
past careers giving your perspective

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,640
that no one else has and if you come

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,679
from a different career path then you

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,020
have those unique perspectives as well

00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:00,549
but I want to take a moment and say that

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,350
I'm not trying to put down anyone that

00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,749
has got on a more traditional path and

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,579
got in that computer science degree I'm

00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:09,130
being honest I'm kind of jealous of

00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:11,110
y'all I wish I discovered coding earlier

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:15,340
in my life but I wouldn't trade the path

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:17,170
that got me here for anything having a

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,330
non-traditional background is an asset

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,160
and I want to open up everyone's eyes

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,380
that's watching this and show you that

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,970
the next time you're sitting in an

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,160
interview or someone who doesn't have a

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,700
computer science screen I want you to

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,380
think

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,780
to this talk and give that person a

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,190
chance because by opening the doors to

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,530
people from non-traditional backgrounds

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,989
you're opening yourself provide more

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,970
diverse inclusive and well-rounded team

00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:44,560
and that team will only improve your

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:47,020
product even more so here's a story of

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,630
how I landed in tech I grew up in

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,250
Nashville Tennessee doing ballet I never

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,020
took a very seriously until I was in

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,880
high school which is when an audition

00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,099
for the Louisville Ballet School summer

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,830
intensive and somewhere intensive is

00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:01,450
like a summer camp for ballet I'm pretty

00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,459
sure I was late to the audition I had my

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,610
hair in a ponytail I did not want to go

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,080
but somehow I still accepted I really

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,400
still don't want to go but my parents

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,500
wanted me out of the house for three

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,910
weeks and it kind of forced me to but

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,430
because of that I started taking ballet

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,440
way more seriously afterwards when I

00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,650
returned home I upped my dance classes

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,870
to around 25 hours a week and when I

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,250
wasn't taking my own classes I was being

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,440
an assistant teacher for some of the

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,150
younger level classes I really improved

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,660
a lot over the next few months because

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,790
of that then the summer before my senior

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,739
year of high school I auditioned for the

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,109
Joffrey Ballet School summer intensive

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,910
and while you're writing for their

00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:40,900
summer intensive you could also audition

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,780
for their year-round

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,820
full-time trainee program a new trainee

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,579
is one of the first steps in becoming a

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,109
professional dancer I attended this

00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,209
summer program but at first I didn't

00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:53,920
accept the traineeship even though

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,390
you're a trainee for a company you still

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,280
have to pay for classes and it's really

00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,829
expensive there was just too much for me

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,900
and my family at the time plus my family

00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,540
was also waving to Chicago and I wanted

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,100
to move in with them when I was there I

00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,170
turned out various studios but I never

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,880
really found one that fit and I also had

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,410
a hard time adjusting my new high school

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,230
I moved my senior year that's something

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:17,260
no kid wants to do so I ended up moving

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,000
by myself at 17 years old to New York

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,229
City to do the Joffrey Ballet School

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,090
traineeship I was dancing

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:27,729
five to six days a week from 9 to 5 I

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,880
was taking to technique classes a day a

00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:33,220
partnering class variations where you

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,440
learn solos from different ballets I had

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,530
rehearsal time and I even took a hit

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,970
ballet history class I did all of that

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,700
while finishing my high school diploma

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,620
online and when the end of the semester

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,599
was coming to a close I knew I need to

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,610
make a decision I wanted to go to

00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:50,620
college but I had to decide if I wanted

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,320
to go and major in ballet which is a

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,930
real thing surprisingly or if I wanted

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,370
to go for something else throughout my

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,530
time at Joffrey I was getting a lot of

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,880
shin splints and unfortunately a lot of

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,430
those times they turn into stress

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,470
fractures Valley's really demanding

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,150
physically you're pushing your body and

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,070
do things it's normally not supposed to

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,409
do and there's obviously consequences to

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,390
one injury can really kill your career

00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:16,300
so I decided I didn't want to pursue

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:18,580
ballet anymore it was a really hard

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,800
decision for me I was always known as

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,590
the ballerina and I felt like I was

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,729
losing a part of who I was but I knew it

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:29,800
was the right decision for me so I moved

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:31,390
back home to Nashville and I rolled for

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,140
my freshman year at Belmont University

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,849
as a public relations major I originally

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,400
wanted nothing to do with the music

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:41,680
industry but Belmonts a music school a

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,720
lot of kids go there for music so I kind

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,789
of got wrapped into it the music

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,320
industry itself is just as competitive

00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:49,659
as if you're trying to be an artist

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,700
there aren't a lot of music publicity

00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:54,760
firms and even fewer that are hiring

00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,659
entry-level assistants I knew I needed a

00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,849
stand out from the crowd

00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,770
so I started interning my freshman year

00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:03,070
and continue to do so each semester

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,140
until I graduated it all paid off when I

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,120
got a job as a publicity assistant at a

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:11,830
social media marketing agency in

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,969
Nashville shortly after graduating a few

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,310
months after landing that publicity

00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:18,130
assistant job I was promoted to being a

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:20,860
full publicist I was really living my

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,690
dream I was originally drawn to public

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,280
relations because of Lauren Conrad and

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,830
the show the hills if y'all remember

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,050
that she means the job look really

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,990
glamorous and it definitely was at times

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,760
I got two good concerts are free hang

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,080
out with celebrities and be on red

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,430
carpets it was also really stressful

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,760
when I was at those concerts I was

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,800
always working typically

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,650
doing a social media takeover i'ma have

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,760
an artist or schmoozing journalist until

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,400
they could do an interview with my

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,620
client after the show when I was at the

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,360
red carpets I'd be running ahead of my

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,400
client on the carpet trying to get

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,050
outlets to do an interview while also

00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,660
trying to monitor the interview my

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,730
client was currently doing when I wasn't

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,230
at a concert or a red carpet I was

00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,820
sending out emails to journalists or

00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,870
trying to get more interviews or

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:11,540
placements I would send out hundreds of

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,750
emails a day to journalists who would

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,220
receive thousands of emails a day it was

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,560
a game of luck whether or not the

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,710
journalists responded to me and I really

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,660
hated that aspect of my job I didn't

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,610
like that someone else opening an email

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,740
and saying yes to working with my client

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,620
determined if I was doing well or not

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,990
and my boss is in my clients eyes my

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,840
anxiety was at an all-time high and I

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,220
dreaded going to work every single day

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:42,200
that's when I knew I needed something

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:44,150
new I had no idea what I wanted to do

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,520
but I knew that I wanted to do something

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,850
that was mentally challenging while also

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,200
giving back to the people around me I

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,960
toured around right with the idea of

00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,850
working in HR and possibly even working

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,710
in higher ed in admissions no idea why I

00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,600
got those in my head but I started

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:03,560
reaching out to people to start pursuing

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,990
those ideas and that was when I stumbled

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,700
upon codecademy I don't really remember

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,540
how I found it but I started teaching

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:13,430
myself HTML and CSS I loved the feeling

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,830
of seeing something I created come to

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,620
life in front of me I did some googling

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,450
and I realized this could be a career so

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,610
I found as many people as I could and

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,590
started studying up coffee dates so I

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,260
could learn what it was like and then in

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,160
their day to day life I learned that

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,740
it's a job where you're constantly

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,630
learning but there's also an amazing

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,330
community of people that's supportive

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,490
and when you can get back to and after

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:41,630
hearing that I was hooked I knew this

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:44,180
was going to be my path now I have a new

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,750
decision to make how would I learn what

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,330
I needed to in order to start

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,070
career I'd only been graduated from

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,360
Belmont for two years and I knew I

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,870
didn't want to go back to school for

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,980
another four so that option was out I

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,350
also knew that because of going to

00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,700
online school outside Joffrey that self

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,130
teaching wasn't really the best route

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,860
for me so I started looking into boot

00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,600
camps I found the iron yard and I

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,390
immediately enrolled in their front-end

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,550
engineering program I was really drawn

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,800
to their small class size and that I

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,690
could fully slowly focus on front-end

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,060
development unlike some other programs I

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,220
had looked into all the stuff that I

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:24,540
remember super nice and welcoming and I

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,520
knew that it was the place for me I had

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,780
my last day of being a music publicist

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,790
on Friday September 3rd 2016 and then I

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,700
started my classes that I renard that

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:38,970
following Monday I opened up my laptop

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,460
that first day and it all hit me I had

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,140
just quit a job I've been pursuing for

00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,750
multiple years all throughout college

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,330
and I worked really hard towards for

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,370
something that may not work out I barely

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,670
knew anything about the tech industry or

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,710
what I was getting myself into and those

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,200
3 months at the iron Yarbrough heart I

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,930
learned all about HTML CSS and

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,880
JavaScript it was like a fire hose of

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,100
information constantly coming at me

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,110
before I felt like I could completely

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,720
grasp one concept we were already moving

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,839
on to the next but the more I learned

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,220
the more I fell in love with coding and

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,260
then towards the end of the program I

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,890
started doing some interviews and I

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,780
noticed a bit of a theme after getting

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,370
through three rounds in one interview I

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,589
was told that although I've been better

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,440
than most of the other interviewers on

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:31,500
the take-home test that I was still too

00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,200
green and I ran into similar problems

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,540
throughout my job search I got judged a

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,160
lot for being my bootcamp graduate and

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,140
when I try to leverage the skills that I

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,000
learned from ballet and my previous PRL

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,000
I was told that they weren't relevant

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,250
and those rejections really got me down

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,770
I felt like I was always immediately

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,420
being judged because I didn't have dicks

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:55,440
that they thought I had I should have

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,630
for this type of role but thankfully

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,090
fast-forward a bit I landed a job at an

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,980
advertising agency we're almost half the

00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,410
team were self-taught or boot camp grads

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,210
I stayed there for almost two years

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,070
before moving to my current position at

00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,440
CrowdStrike another place that's

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:14,670
extremely accepted of my non-traditional

00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,320
background it still baffles me that I

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,450
was judged for my rear past attack

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,100
because through interviewing I realized

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,620
that throughout my time being a

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,090
ballerina and a music pollicis that was

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,650
being taught these lessons that I have

00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,740
no idea would be useful in the tech

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:32,100
world possibly the most surprising thing

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:36,570
to me was how similar ballet and coding

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:39,420
actually are becoming a ballerina takes

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,310
a lot of practice it looks really easy

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,310
but that's only because the dancers

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:46,380
wanted to make you think that thousands

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:49,200
of hours go into becoming a professional

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,090
ballerina girls employees often start

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,440
training around three years old to

00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,710
become a professional in their late

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,210
teens to early twenties but even when a

00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,740
ballerina becomes a professional it

00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,510
doesn't mean that they stop practicing

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,390
or learning or try and get better and

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,950
the same thing happens as developers we

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,070
put in a lot of time learning various

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,170
languages and frameworks um take a break

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,480
for instance as much as I wish it was

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:15,360
true you don't do a tutorial and become

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,910
an expert overnight a lot of time is put

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,410
into mastering what we do and even once

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,790
you do become some comfortable with

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,330
something like ember it doesn't mean you

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:26,070
stop practicing or trying to learn more

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,380
doing tutorials and coding challenges is

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,540
often healthiest developers build our

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,670
foundation we'll acknowledge and how we

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,770
learn new things and it's the same way

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,690
with ballerinas they start each day with

00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:40,080
a technique class going over the basics

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,120
of ballet this is how both ballerinas

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,880
and developers continue to grow and

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,470
learn throughout time and this was

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,910
something that was really hard for me to

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,460
grasp when I first made the switch to

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,890
tech I knew as competing against people

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,930
who had tough as four years I wanted my

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,200
code to be flawless the first time I ran

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,100
it but that doesn't happen I love ballet

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,529
because I knew I could always be

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,930
learning and improving and now I've come

00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,269
to learn that come to love the fact that

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,250
with coding I'll be doing the same I'll

00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,089
always be learning and practicing and

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,500
that's amazing

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:16,149
because that's always something I really

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,220
enjoyed when I was doing ballet ballet

00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,709
also taught me to pay attention to the

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,079
small details that lies extremely

00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:25,089
meticulous and one of the basic moves in

00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:27,399
ballet is called a tendu in French it

00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:30,130
means to stretch it may seem like a very

00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:32,319
simple move but it's not and even though

00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:35,980
I can't see you I want you to stand up

00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:38,620
and try to do one with me step let me

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,089
back up here I know it's kinda hard to

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,920
see me but you're gonna start with your

00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:44,259
legs together and your hands on your

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,480
hips you'll want to make sure your abs

00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:48,759
are engaged and that your ribcage are

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,560
closed next you're gonna put your feet

00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,940
in first position which I know you may

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,430
not be able to see your feet it's like a

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,620
tiny little bean and don't forget about

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,410
your abs and your ribs those are still

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,819
engaged and then while singing here

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,709
you're also to make sure your inner

00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:04,899
thighs and your claws are engaged and

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:07,509
lift it but don't forget about your abs

00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,880
the whole idea with ballet is to engage

00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:12,040
every single tiny muscle so you're

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,139
appearing as tall as possible and you

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,819
can just stand be here like this it's

00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:17,860
really hard and you're not even doing a

00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:20,259
table yet it's not something natural for

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,569
your body to do so let's actually do it

00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,730
on you now while keeping everything

00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:26,949
engaged and lifted you're gonna push

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,569
your foot into the ground

00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,310
make sure your ball of the foot is

00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:32,500
really pushing in and then make sure

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,180
your foot is pointed and fully stretched

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,310
and turned on you wanna keep your like

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,589
turned out but you can't forget about

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,660
your inner thighs your cloths your ass

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:43,300
everything's still engaging lift it it's

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:46,990
really hard ever make y'all sit down

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,850
look toward to you any longer so the

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,560
more advanced moves that starts out with

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,199
the Tundra's called a romper say and I

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,579
will not make you all try this one when

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,259
first learning to do with a lot of

00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:56,590
ballerinas make the mistake of not

00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:58,600
paying

00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,700
attention to the star D a limit on do

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,910
instead focus on getting their leg up

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,850
into that half turn but paying attention

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,050
to the small details of the tendu and

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,970
activating every single one of your

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,740
muscles really pushing your foot into

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,400
the floor and pointing through your

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,380
whole foot

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:19,480
it's what's giving you the power to do

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:22,240
the move and execute it correctly so how

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,470
is the similar coding first of all there

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,240
have been dozens of times I've

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,970
overlooked something as simple as a

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,800
semicolon half an hour later when my

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,900
code isn't compiling I'm sitting there

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,210
laughing at myself because I'd realized

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,220
what I missed and I do the same thing

00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,050
with ballet whenever I was struggling

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,000
with a certain move my teacher would

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,980
have me take a step back and break it

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,290
down piece by piece similar how to

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,510
review smaller sections of code when you

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,700
find something's wrong and a lot of

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:52,000
times with ballet or code it's those

00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,070
small details that matter and it's extra

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,050
important when coding because those

00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,030
small details play into other decisions

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,000
like if you install the extra dependency

00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:03,040
or not those decisions affect the people

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,870
that use our product they can cause

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,330
things like performance issues and we

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,040
need to take that into consideration the

00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,200
small details make a difference in our

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,670
day-to-day work and paying attention to

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,800
them can save both you and your

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:19,330
customers minutes or even sometimes

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,460
hours of frustration possibly one of the

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,870
biggest things that I taught me was how

00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,270
to get feedback and not take it

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,880
personally both ballet and coding are

00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:29,490
extremely personal in ballet you're

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,450
telling a story through your body and

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,610
encoding you're building something from

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,830
scratch there's no such thing as being

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,410
perfect in either ballet or in code I

00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,270
was in class or her salon received no

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,890
feedback and that was waste of time

00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,470
because I wasn't learning how to improve

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:47,200
and I feel the same way when I submit

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,490
code for review I want people just to us

00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,320
how I could have done something

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,540
differently or catch a mistake I may

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,580
have missed I craved that feedback

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,520
because a person is doing it because

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,900
they want me to grow and learn and award

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,000
Rorty of the time when someone makes a

00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,550
comment on my code it's something that I

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,540
hadn't realized before you can't grow

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,700
without that feedback

00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,459
that's how ballerinas develop their

00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,280
artistry and how we as engineers develop

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,420
better code

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,939
I'm really amazed that all the things

00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,709
that they taught me but being a PR also

00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,709
taught me several things I use day to

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,600
day as a developer one of the things I

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,550
constantly use from PR are my writing

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,350
skills whether it was writing an email

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,870
or writing press releases I was always

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,940
writing and when I was doing so as

00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,250
extremely particular not only about the

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:36,340
words I was using but about how concise

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,560
I was being selecting the right word to

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,060
perfectly convey my message and keeping

00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,620
everything short and sweet could mean

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,780
the difference between a journalist

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,840
opening and reading my email and saying

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,610
yes to an opportunity or not and not

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,740
only does that help me as someone who

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,960
enjoys giving talks and writing blog

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,560
post but it helps me my day-to-day life

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,020
as a developer as developers our day is

00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,420
it's been exclusively writing code we're

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,680
climbing the code explaining to others

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,630
why we chose something to do a

00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,450
particular way or even writing

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:10,090
documentation being concise and clear

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,290
doing those not only helps yourself when

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,180
you come back to something you've worked

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,860
on previously but helps anyone

00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:19,300
interacting with anything that you've

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:21,790
done PR also taught me how to work as a

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,460
team there's this thing that people in

00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:26,500
PR or people in people who aren't

00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,110
developers excuse me do so because you

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,850
don't want to work with others but I

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,820
probably work with people more so now

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:36,250
than I did when I was in PR as a

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,650
publicist I worked with managers record

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,910
labels and marketing teams it all worked

00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,470
together to put it to it

00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,420
we'd all work together to put together a

00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,900
vision for our artist and execute it

00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,170
correctly

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,820
Nessus developers we do the same now

00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,230
tech day goes by that I'm not reaching

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,880
out to someone else on the team whether

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,030
it be managers designers writers

00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,170
researchers or other developers

00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,580
sometimes is a question for a designer

00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,120
sometimes a pairing with another

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,920
developer as developers were interacting

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,620
with so many different people across so

00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,330
many different teams it's vital to have

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,250
those strong team working skills and

00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,690
that's something that really makes the

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:15,160
difference between a good and a bad

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:16,630
developer working as a publicist didn't

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,060
only teach me things I use in my

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,399
day-to-day life as a dev but also taught

00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,570
me

00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:23,899
the important things that were useful

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:25,849
when I was interviewing the first is

00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:27,259
that although I think it hated sending

00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:29,119
those hundreds of emails a day to

00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:31,460
journalist that it really taught me how

00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,619
to stand out amongst the crowd all

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,809
journalists ratinho to receive a ton of

00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:36,679
emails a day from publicist vying for

00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,869
their attention

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,239
it made me become creative not only my

00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:44,059
pitches but even the subject lines of my

00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:46,399
emails something as simple as including

00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,869
hello and the journalist name was unique

00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:50,479
enough to get me a couple more views

00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:52,309
that I wasn't kidding before I took what

00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:54,710
I learned and I applied it when I was

00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,719
for a shop search Inc there are a lot of

00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,219
you develop her roles out there but also

00:19:56,719 --> 00:20:00,019
a lot of people applying for the same

00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:01,879
role I want to make sure that my

00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:03,799
application was unique so now I was

00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:05,539
applying for jobs I created a custom

00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,969
email template that I sent along with my

00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:10,190
resume it included the company's logo

00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:13,190
and then was all done in their brand

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,899
colors it was the most advanced thing it

00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,969
honestly wasn't the prettiest it was

00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:18,919
enough to make me stand out and would

00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:20,839
not ask that company why they chose to

00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:25,039
interview me from a stock of applicants

00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:26,629
it was often because of those emails the

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,669
second thing that PR taught me is great

00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:30,469
interview skills a big part of my job

00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:32,570
was training my clients how to interview

00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:34,279
I'd help them practice the questions

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,690
they typically get how to answer

00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,460
something if they didn't know what to

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,369
say and how to leave their personal

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,599
story throughout their interview

00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:43,279
developers are often most concerned with

00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,599
the technical interview which obviously

00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,909
is a big part of the interviewing

00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,450
process but in order to get there you

00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:50,089
have to get through that

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,589
getting-to-know-you interview first so I

00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:53,659
took what I teach my clients and I've

00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:55,580
lied that to myself I thought a lot

00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:57,349
about the common questions I'd be asked

00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,349
and I knew I'd always be asked about my

00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:01,729
career transition so now when I'm asked

00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:04,609
at all of the interviewer little more

00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:06,379
about myself I talk about why I decided

00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:08,299
to make the switch then throughout the

00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:09,649
rest of my interview I talk about the

00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:12,200
things I learned from being a ballerina

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:14,599
and a publicist and how that helps me as

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,190
a developer I tell a story at my

00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:19,700
interview much like I would teach my

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,710
clients to do one of the biggest

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,349
takeaways I have from both ballet and PR

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,789
is that community is important I didn't

00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,299
have a community either in my past

00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,999
careers

00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:30,730
Vala is extremely competitive there's

00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:32,890
only so many roles and always

00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,929
any spots in a company some companies

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,429
even compete make you compete each year

00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:39,340
for what level you'll be within the

00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:41,350
company and PR is the same way each

00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,929
publicist is vying for the attention of

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,429
the same journalist besides the people I

00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:48,309
worked with I didn't really have anyone

00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:50,169
I could turn to and ask questions I was

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:51,640
amazed when I was at my boot camp seeing

00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:54,100
how supportive of our community is

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,950
through Twitter chats slack groups

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,450
meetups and conferences it's a part of

00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,890
the reason why I wanted to be a co

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,140
organizer for the Nashville women

00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,120
programmers when I was the publicist I

00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,130
had a plan a lot of events I did ice

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,049
cream socials invited journalists music

00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,900
video shoots and I even let bar hopping

00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:12,280
in a limo once I really like throwing

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,950
events so now I applied those skills

00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,140
that I had from PR to our natural women

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,940
programmers meetup and through that I'm

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,600
able to show others how amazing of a

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:25,270
community we have honestly I probably go

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,190
over an hour about what the impr taught

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,480
me there are so many more things that

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,179
I've learned than what I've talked about

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,220
but my story is just one of a few people

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:34,980
who now work in tact after previously

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,679
coming from a non-traditional background

00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:41,260
in fact according to this 2019 Stack

00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,179
Overflow survey thirty seven point six

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,610
percent of people working in tech now

00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:48,130
who have a college degree do not have a

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,360
computer science degree there are more

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,830
people in tech who come from that

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,990
non-traditional background than ever

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,549
before and with the popularity of boot

00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,559
camps and people self teaching to make

00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:59,980
the switch the numbers only going to

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,390
continue to grow my aunt Denise is

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,740
actually one of those people who made

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,320
the switch to tech and I'm extremely

00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,730
proud of her she left her job as a life

00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,559
insurance underwriter to attend

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,570
Northwestern University's full-stack

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,580
boot camp and now she's working as a

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:16,299
developer in Chicago that focuses on

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:18,250
accessibility my friend Amanda also

00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:19,929
taught herself to code while working in

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,330
the outdoor recreation and customer

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:24,340
service industries now she works as

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,179
developer at Lewis communications in

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,820
Brentwood Tennessee another amazing

00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:32,860
story is iki oh I was introduced to him

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,299
through that through the weekly code

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,090
newbies Twitter chats and I'm really

00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:38,950
fascinated about his story he studied in

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,750
Arras Israel to originally become a

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,000
rabbi but then

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,429
to attend the flatiron school's bootcamp

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,950
in your city now he works as a software

00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:51,820
engineer there and blogs about tech on

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:53,799
his site rabbi on Rails these are just a

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,169
few of the amazing stories of people who

00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,330
made the switch to tech I posted all of

00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:01,450
dev asking for more stories I received

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,070
so many responses people who transition

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,500
from being social media managers

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:08,049
teachers translators architects

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,630
musicians aircraft maintenance engineers

00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:12,909
and more we've heard time and time again

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,799
that coding is the future there are so

00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,360
many job opportunities in this field and

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,539
that isn't stopping anytime soon

00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,309
we need more candidates so why do people

00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:22,690
have this mentality that someone who

00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:25,480
doesn't have a computer science degree

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,610
doesn't belong by saying that you're

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,460
rejecting people like Nikhil my aunt

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:33,840
Denise Amanda myself and so many more

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,950
people who could only add to your team

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,750
so what can we do to make our hiring

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,850
process more inclusive to those who have

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,289
non-traditional backgrounds doing

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,179
something as simple as removing the

00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:45,190
requirement of having a computer science

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:47,110
degree from your listing will attract

00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,970
even more applicants there's been

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:51,010
numerous times when I then applied to a

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,679
job listing because I had a CS to re

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:56,530
requirement then during your interviews

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,539
assess candidates for their potential we

00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,820
downplay having a strong soft skills

00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:03,039
attack but we shouldn't be those soft

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,049
skills are things like problem solving

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,960
initiative learn and mentoring others

00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:10,000
and those are transferable don't put as

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,130
much emphasis on a candidate's potential

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,120
don't put as much emphasis on a

00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:17,169
candidate's credential as I mean but

00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,720
instead take a look at those

00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:21,400
transferrable skills your tech stack can

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,799
always be taught but those are the

00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,390
skills but those transferable skills are

00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,220
the ones that are tougher to learn and

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,960
in my opinion or what makes a really

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,380
good candidate become a really great

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,820
candidate if you're on the other end of

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,799
the spectrum and searching for a job

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,270
when you don't have a CS degree take a

00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,070
step back and look at what I've what

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,169
you've done in the past do what I've

00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,940
done in this talk see where you can pull

00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:44,230
similarities from your past experiences

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,970
and use those to your advantage

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,100
weave those things you've learned

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,040
throughout your interviews to show how

00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,990
much of an asset

00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,490
can be and prove that even though you

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,050
may be new to their team now that

00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:58,910
eventually you're going to be their next

00:25:54,050 --> 00:26:01,280
senior engineer so as a former ballerina

00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,770
turned music publicist or a software

00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,080
engineer if I can find similarities

00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:09,110
through those three very drastic careers

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,000
than anybody else can those past

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,070
experiences give me the strength in my

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,970
career as a developer and they shouldn't

00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:19,180
be treated as if they don't thank you so

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,180
