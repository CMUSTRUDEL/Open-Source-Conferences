Description: 
	Investing in Ember by Jessica Jordan

Less productivity, missed project deadlines and wasted money: thatâ€™s what you get for letting your developers work on open-source projects. Or do you really?

In this talk you will learn about the value that an investment in OSS provides to businesses on different levels. By example of organisations who benefit and give back to the open-source project Ember, you will see why paying your team to spend time on OSS might be the best business decision you will make this year.

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,970
hi everyone what's happening

00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,919
I'm Jessica Jordan it doesn't really

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,230
matter if you're a software engineer a

00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:30,939
project manager it's he need or the

00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,250
founder of a company if you're

00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:34,570
interested in moving yourself forward

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,110
professionally your team or your

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,559
business

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,449
this talk is exactly for you you will

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,110
take a look at strategies we can employ

00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:48,370
to tap into the potential of open source

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,769
and also to which extent doing so will

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,210
actually benefit us and that's at least

00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:55,180
by the end of the talk you might

00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,580
actually realize that investing in ember

00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,430
is the best business decision you're

00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,530
gonna make this year but before we talk

00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,210
about investment and all the stuff let's

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,750
talk about ember and what actually

00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:11,130
brings me here to talk about this

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,750
several years ago when I was trying to

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,000
take the next step in my learning

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:19,060
journey as a back developer and it's

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,850
front-end engineer I found that there

00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,340
was a very interesting concept I want to

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,380
get more into which was all about

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,810
building single page applications back

00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,229
then this was so kind of like a big new

00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,390
thing and I found ember to be quite

00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:36,670
promising in this regard because it had

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,310
to slow in this idea that I was actually

00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,649
able to build large-scale and

00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,990
maintainable web applications using this

00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:46,359
framework and I found it really

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,490
interesting and exciting for strong

00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,890
conventions that it had and having the

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:54,399
feeling that I can build on top of the

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,159
foundation of patterns and parody games

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,939
that have been battle tested by a global

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,350
community also the feeling that in yeah

00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:04,179
the user interface and develop

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,710
experience was quite modern with the

00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:08,259
seal I which was still a very new thing

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,280
back then I had the feeling to be very

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:14,470
productive and could get my things kind

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,040
of like out of the gate rather easily

00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,870
and also have the

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,409
feeling that the framework actually

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,750
developed itself and undertook some

00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:26,409
evolution throughout the years was also

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,359
what waited worth staying for me and

00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:31,939
specifically in regards to looking at

00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:35,180
the recent embark chain release I think

00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:38,120
it is not an understatement to say ember

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,819
is the modern framework unless but at

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,319
least maybe one of the things that are

00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:45,079
found really intriguing when I just

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,139
started learning ember was learn much

00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:50,629
more about open source and why was this

00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:53,900
so interesting to me why I was open

00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:56,290
source such a big deal I think just like

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,790
with learning Umbra I really realized

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:03,409
how much of a game changer this actually

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,970
was the ability that that you as an

00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:08,510
engineer could actually go on to get up

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,450
and really look into the source code or

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,669
for example ember and then even if you

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,139
even if you ran this kind of person

00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,700
would actually occur at the source code

00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:18,650
like from the top to the bottom

00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,900
like in just like looking at some of the

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,159
bits of it it kind of made you feel that

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,349
you can better understanding how it

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,150
works under the hood and that maybe you

00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,340
could use some of these bits and pieces

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,720
of knowledge to build better bett

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,040
applications based on ember

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,959
this was really big thing for me at

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,459
least expect them and I think to this

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,919
day it still is for a lot of suffering

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,169
genius has this idea that if you use

00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,599
some source you have a lot of power and

00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,790
control and the knowledge what you

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,760
actually build your applications and the

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,989
other software on top off it's not only

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,459
about the public source code is also

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:50,690
about things like depending on the

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,260
license that you can modify and

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,199
redistribute the software and maybe try

00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,180
out ideas in the open-source community

00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,280
by doing so and also the fact that

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,919
documentation tends to be ranked rather

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,530
high quality because it is also openly

00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,889
developed with a group of peers from all

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,870
across globe so on source on an

00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:14,509
individual software level software

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,090
engineer level is actually quite a

00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:19,400
really nice thing when you appreciate it

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,139
but now let's take

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,790
like what does it actually mean in a

00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,710
business context however like any

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,360
benefits are there any values for

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,039
businesses and companies to use all the

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,560
source I want to share some with you to

00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:35,810
illustrate some of the ideas behind that

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,150
in a research paper by Fujairah carry

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,750
from 2003 and called

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,460
open source in suffering the trenches

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,220
lessons from a large-scale OSS

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,570
implementation they had a look at the

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:52,100
deployment of saw strategy and a public

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,530
large-scale health sector organization

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,660
in Dublin Ireland the remote Hospital

00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:00,919
and the case study they found a very

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,900
interesting incentive of the hospital to

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,600
implement open source in their own IT

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,190
infrastructure by the end of 2002 the

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,110
management found themselves in a

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,690
budgetary shortfall 17 million euro

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,240
quite a lot of money and they wanted to

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,699
find a way around that to actually solve

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,400
this problem one idea was to reiterate

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,990
the expenses on their T Department and I

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,190
can tell you from the research and

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,310
analysis that it did

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:29,240
the findings were actually quite

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:31,099
surprising so the took a look what they

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,510
can really spent and they found that

00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:34,729
there were a couple of preparatory

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,979
commercial services that they were using

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:40,099
that kind of like cost a bit of money

00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:42,440
and to get them working and to get the

00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,940
infrastructure running so for example

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,780
for email services that paid one hundred

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,699
thousand euro or every single year to

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:52,599
maintain the infrastructure for around

00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:55,130
3,000 staff members back at the time

00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:57,229
this is not so much the interesting part

00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,180
yet the interesting part is now to look

00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:02,750
at a comparison that they did back then

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,060
with valuable solutions alternatives

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,130
from the old sauce wheel that they could

00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,260
use instead of this property solutions

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,270
that are already used and spent so much

00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,169
money for what the phone is actually

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,030
quite dramatic

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:16,639
they found that using all the source

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,349
software solutions similar to what they

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,979
want to achieve with the email services

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,870
they could possibly actually put the

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:25,780
expenses down

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,460
100,000 euro quite a lot of sailors

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,690
isn't it

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,970
and it doesn't enter here with emails

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,650
it's also about desktop apps content

00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,420
management services and app servers that

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,310
will be using an IT infrastructure and

00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,960
even here compared with open source

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,660
software based solutions they found a

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:44,410
potential saving saving potential of

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,050
over 100k 100k and like me under Kenya

00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,450
respectively and also like the least

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,520
really big cost factor the hospital

00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,080
imaging and because this is useful

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,170
Diagnostics and actually quite critical

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,780
for the business operation of a hospital

00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,940
this is of course of a cost factor where

00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,070
you cannot really kind of like try to

00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,320
bring down the price you just like pay

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,090
as much as you need and this is also

00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,580
maybe one of the reasons why this is

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,100
such a tremendous cost factor the IT

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,830
department there's almost 4.2 million

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,490
euro every single year it has been quite

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,970
a contributing factor to the budgetary

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,740
problems that the organization faced and

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,780
even here in this very specific example

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,580
x-ray digital imaging technology you can

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,010
imagine how small the community is it

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,630
actually tries to disappear software

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,660
anthers even there they could actually

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:38,890
find almost Essbase components that

00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,840
would help them to make savings and also

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,880
here the same potentials quadratic

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,190
they've found using open source they

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,470
might actually have another potential

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,640
for savings of over four point one five

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:53,920
million all of this costs and savings

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,840
actually add up so they calculated that

00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,850
for the first year of implementation of

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,440
own source of resolutions they might

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,510
have a saving potential of twelve point

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,890
seven five million euro and or five

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,770
years calculating all the maintenance

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,840
cost renewing subscriptions for

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,910
commercial services they also found that

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,140
here they had an immense saving

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,730
potential of eight point one seven

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,050
billion euro and just to give you an

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,120
idea of what eight point one seven

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,950
million euro means because and this I

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,970
personally after 1 million euro I don't

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,850
understand what this number means

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,920
anymore for an organization and

00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:27,190
Dublin Ireland the swings that means

00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,400
paying the average salary of 48 medical

00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:33,280
scientists or a group of 27 doctors or a

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,680
group of 36 nurses for another five

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,900
years so quite a lot of money and also

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,090
shall see how real aberration opensource

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,590
actually was these solutions that the

00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,920
organized organisation could actually

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:49,210
choose to overcome the budget problem

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,370
and this idea that we can in the

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,200
business context use of us also

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,910
infrastructure offer products that we

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,610
build on top of this is what we called

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,680
open source exhibition acquiring open

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,840
source and then oftentimes this was

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,330
results on a lot of flag benefits which

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,600
includes the saving money maybe the most

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:10,660
obvious potential that we get from using

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,160
open source in a business but not the

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,660
single one actually to illustrate this I

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,450
want to share a quote with you but

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:22,240
resembling the executed director of the

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,400
Nieman Foundation who also shared why he

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,130
thinks businesses really catch on to

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,590
this idea to use open source he for

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,600
example said shared development is an

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:36,760
aiding faster development with higher

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:40,000
quality lower costs this is causing the

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,010
software value chain to change the idea

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,470
is that it's not only about being

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,030
concerned about like your finances when

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,610
you use an open source it's also about

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,920
trying to create faster development

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,530
cycles for products that are based on

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,910
the source and making sure that by share

00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,130
with the moment in outside of

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,720
organization the quality has to be

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,580
higher because more people are actually

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,520
trying to figure out what are the best

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,740
solution for not only your specific use

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,690
case but for a lot of people's different

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,760
use cases and this in admittedly

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,470
actually makes the products better that

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,200
they could ever have been but just

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:18,660
developing them internally in a single

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,250
organization so this quality idea behind

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,440
improving products is what makes all

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,020
source acquisition also so attractive to

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,550
a lot of businesses and what you also

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,040
mentioned that this is causing the

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,240
software value chain to change and salsa

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,880
luminaries this

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,920
far-distant utopian future but actually

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,980
it is not a secret probably already

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,459
imagined as well from your own teams and

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:46,300
because in 2015 was already found that

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:48,670
95% of modern digital products were

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,149
actually based on open-source software

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,950
components and if we estimate that this

00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:55,120
development actually continued up until

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,420
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,690
we can also imagine that nowadays it is

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,339
safe to say that every single business

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,680
every kind of like operating

00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:07,240
organization is actually based on

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,390
open-source and it's using one source

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,060
for its own benefit this idea of open

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,550
source acquisition so it's kind of like

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,890
rather common and Quine of like well

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:22,570
understood but what if I told you that

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:24,670
this is not even trying to fully embrace

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,860
the potential of what open source could

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,810
do to businesses what if I told you this

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,700
is just the tip of the iceberg and that

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:34,209
the full potential of open source is not

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,660
even kind of like who touched yet I've

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:39,880
talked about yet when we talk about

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,279
better products and trying to save money

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,050
by using open source so now you wonder

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,300
what is this underbelly of this iceberg

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,940
what is this untapped potential we would

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,529
take a look at this in just a bit

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,120
but let's first of all take a look at an

00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,790
interesting interview series we did at

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,050
the Ember Times newsletter which if you

00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,870
haven't subscribed it you should totally

00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:02,170
do that just right now go to get bits

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,640
and gets a subscription going Jonah's

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,950
awesome support and more times on the

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:10,120
discord okay this is really the end of

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:12,490
of the pitch but anyways we did it we

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,110
series and we tried to talk with

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,690
different community members about their

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,730
motivations and also the interest to

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,040
contribute to ember and be part of the

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,230
group we also talked with Geneva who's

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,899
an ember core learning team member and

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:30,120
buffering framework or team member who

00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:34,000
also gave this excellent keynote just

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,490
earlier here back on and who talked with

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,070
us also about her intrinsic motivations

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:43,630
to contribute to memory and she said

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:45,730
that contributed to ember is really fun

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,440
I started by writing but the chance to

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,690
learn from others was what really made

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,790
of Mustang the things that I've learned

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,430
from other people participating here

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,650
help me my job every day and not just on

00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,380
the cold front even on the team dynamic

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:03,220
level leadership strategies and best

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:05,290
practices many of the things that she

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,420
talks about data don't have anything to

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,279
do with the fact that she is trying to

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,670
use a thesaurus so she can save money

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,140
it's about a whole other sphere of how

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,240
we can leverage open source and

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,390
businesses this is not only about

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,880
acquiring it it's also about integrating

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,500
open source in a more holistic way and

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,589
trying to find other ways to interact

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,380
with it the sub process of giving back

00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,940
to projects to contribute it and see

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,740
which kind of benefits you can get for

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,510
it is what we call open source

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,070
integration and this is also something

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,430
that's actually valid relevant for this

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:41,140
but sometimes not as well understood as

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,240
obsession because there many different

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,370
levels of open-source integration can

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,500
have business and organizations both on

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:51,190
the team individual and also on the

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:54,839
whole scale large-scale business one

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:57,339
example that we can think of by

00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:04,740
listening to the interview just valium

00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:04,740
was whoops one moment please

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:19,780
here we go sorry about that one thing

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:22,480
that we thought about when we think

00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,370
about OSS integration is the fact that

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,430
engineers who actually contribute to

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,560
open source have another and very

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,150
significant way to prove their own

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,830
skills in many different areas be

00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,300
technical skills learning a new

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,580
programming language kinda like more

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,500
intimate knowledge of libraries or

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,510
frameworks that they're using won't

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,430
forget organizational skills trying to

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,100
lead initiatives in the community for

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,350
example of writing our C's or trying to

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,830
lead the efforts for example redesign of

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,930
a website to bring them to life and to

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,390
bring back these kind of skills that

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,310
have been honed in remote collaboration

00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,200
with peers all around the world into

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,590
your own organization where they can

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:05,460
also be very beneficial it's all about

00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:08,490
thinking of an awful way to try to

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,570
provide for the room and the space for

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,940
engineers who are already working on it

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,560
teams to nurture their own excellence

00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,040
that they already have and to really

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,840
fulfill the new full potential and last

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,000
but not least also if you think about it

00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,620
from this way what does it actually mean

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,440
if an engineer can really work on

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,060
something that they share values with

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,700
what if engineer really feels that

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,530
having a real impact not only on a

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,540
product that is developed internally but

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,550
on something that is used by

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,940
organizations all around the world and

00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:42,480
that can have like real promoted use

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,890
case and be a real solution out there is

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,660
something that the value value and can

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,760
give them also another sense of

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,120
fulfillment that might even exceed their

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,130
fulfillment in the day to day job if we

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,290
think about this way we can also think

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,180
about that this is some nourishment we

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,960
can provide to teams to engineers and to

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:05,350
our business by providing the sense of

00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:09,090
fulfillment and work satisfaction and of

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:11,770
course this is not the end of the story

00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,970
oftentimes if you often hiring processes

00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,010
at all you find yourself in the

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,329
situation where you want to grow your

00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,910
team another time and

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:20,980
and you say to yourself and you have

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,839
like a job and out there that says

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,519
something along the lines of that you're

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,230
looking for C no JavaScript engineer

00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,079
that should have at least at five years

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,970
experience with ember maybe this should

00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,889
be driven motivated self-starter I have

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,709
a can-do attitude the list goes on and

00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:36,999
on and on and and at the end of the day

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,439
she might actually find a lot of like

00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:40,329
red coming outside when you fit this

00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:42,309
profile really nicely and you're already

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:45,220
doing a great job to get all of these

00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:48,790
great people potentially getting onto

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,819
your team and creating great work but

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,579
then at one kind of like blocker which

00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:55,899
is all about them also comes like

00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:59,110
interviewing with a lot of other places

00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:01,480
and then realizing I am extra not fully

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,779
confident yet if I should really go with

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,449
company X I'm not company Y and if you

00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:10,029
are company X you come from like now

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,860
realize yeah this is actually quite

00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:15,299
frustrating to spend a lot of like time

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:17,439
and money into hiring processes and

00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,510
sometimes it really just doesn't work

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,149
out because the demand for skilled

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,760
workers knowledge workers is really high

00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:27,669
and it's actually not so clear yet how

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:32,049
to get this competitive edge at the very

00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:33,789
end of and telling process - yeah get

00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:37,480
people to really confident say I want to

00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:39,610
be here and what if I now told you that

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,970
even this very specific aspect of your

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,860
business

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,409
um sauce can actually play a crucial

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,480
role what if I told you that an open

00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:48,399
source integrator talent strategy is

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,600
something that actually can give you

00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,580
this competitive edge that you're

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,590
looking for the second low caliber could

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,600
actually play out so imagine you

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,340
actually accept the fact that this could

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,830
be the key to your talent strategy

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,419
success and he implemented almost all

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,190
strategy we will take a look later on

00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:05,620
how this could look like in practice

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,980
just assume this for now what you might

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,450
find is that especially and these people

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,000
who already contribute your sauce that

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:16,450
find a lot of fact value and contributed

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,389
it in their paid work time after your

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,859
company got an increased sense of a film

00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,109
satisfaction because it can actually

00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:25,809
adhere through the own interest rather

00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:28,629
easily by choosing Freedy Baraka no

00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:31,209
sauce product what you might find out of

00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:33,159
this as well that turns retainment is a

00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:35,440
bit easier to do in your company as well

00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,959
just because work satisfaction increase

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,119
and what do you get out of this as well

00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:42,159
might be that especially if you're

00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,469
engineers are really involved in all the

00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,690
source communities that they reach out

00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:49,450
to other engineers rather automatically

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,789
by working on any kind of projects and

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,889
that this kind of network that they're

00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:56,019
creating and it's also something that

00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:58,029
can later on help you in the turn

00:18:56,019 --> 00:19:00,549
acquisition process by being able to

00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:02,139
actually proactively reach out to other

00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:04,149
skilled engineers that already have the

00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:05,619
skillset that you are looking for by

00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:07,929
being involved in the same or sauce

00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:09,999
community as you are engineers are

00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:12,249
already in you actually have the chance

00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:14,349
to provide opportunities to people who

00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:16,989
may be looking for the next career steps

00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:18,759
months or years from now and thinking

00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,999
about these five key steps of your test

00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:23,109
but a giant our place in it all sauce is

00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:25,379
something that you could also keep in

00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:28,119
mind and might being kind of like the

00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:31,029
convincing factor for your already but

00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:33,339
even after this even after kind of like

00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:35,169
highlighting how attracting talent

00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:38,649
retain so it might be something that's

00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:40,359
really great for you and helpful source

00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:42,639
can play a role you might so kind of

00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:44,829
like think to yourself well like

00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,690
honestly sounds already great in theory

00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,459
but like a practice how does this really

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,779
work there's more company mutable of

00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:51,700
deadlines we've worked in a very

00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,169
fast-paced environment you don't have

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,239
the time and the money to actually do

00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:57,129
one of this just like another thing that

00:19:55,239 --> 00:20:01,749
actually distracts us from our core

00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:03,940
business and honestly I believe you

00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:05,919
actually have the best idea of what is

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,049
best for your business because you

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,669
actually part of it and you know how it

00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,889
actually works and what restrictions you

00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:14,409
have to deal with on a day to day basis

00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:17,409
so this part of the talk is not all

00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:19,329
about trying to convince you what is

00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,789
right or wrong it's more about giving

00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:22,629
your ideas what you could employ and

00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:24,669
what you create

00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:27,120
leave out depending on what you really

00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:28,440
need and maybe there's something

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,140
that I'll show you right now in an

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,180
example of how source could look like in

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,980
practice that available for you maybe

00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,630
they're not but just keep an old mind

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,400
and see if there's something that you

00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,740
could take away from when we talk about

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,110
home source can look like in action and

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,990
practice by the examples of different

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,000
strategies in real-life businesses as

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:51,000
this example I want to highlight one

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,400
strategy at a company that I know quite

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,400
well because I worked there for almost

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,950
four years which is simple at

00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,230
consultancy based and you make we also

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,540
very involved in the EMA community and

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,540
here for example we also really value to

00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,270
find a way to integrate open source into

00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:12,809
our actual work and not have it only

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:15,240
just like a side asset and here we try

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:16,500
to leverage the 20% time method if

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,750
you're not familiar with it it's the

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,140
idea that you have like one day per week

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:24,350
so 20% time for a single week available

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,880
for working on source code contributions

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,940
preparation of conference talks writing

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,730
book pose or be it also organizing

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,320
community events and for the rest of the

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,420
time you actually work on your core

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,179
business for example in our case working

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,700
on client projects the great thing is

00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:43,559
about this as well how we try to do it

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,840
with the 24 sometimes that by the way

00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,460
that well rebalance it we can also give

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,080
equal opportunity of this time to

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,090
everyone so every engineer every

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,250
designer can actually leverage it and

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,170
work on their own interesting projects

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,520
that they find last but least we also

00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:59,910
want to make sure that they actually get

00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,710
tangible outcomes 20% time and so these

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,800
outcomes should be shared either with

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:07,890
the team or with our community and I

00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:12,030
think it's it's an understatement to say

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:14,510
that the 20% time and being able to work

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:18,240
on open source that simple apps had

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:22,020
significant impact I think it is maybe

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,450
one of the outstanding factors of our

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,250
company so far to be able to have a lot

00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,920
of like great projects out there that

00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:31,620
actually hallmarks of our work in the

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,870
community including over a dozen

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,640
javascript rules for example and that

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,100
simple off ok

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,530
who help developers all around the world

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,730
in their day to day businesses to create

00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:46,770
great direct applications and yeah maybe

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,750
you also see from this that these

00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,460
benefits are real and this is also

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:55,140
something you could consider for your

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,370
own business but not for at least at the

00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,350
end of the day if you think about

00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,270
investing if you think about investing

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,890
open source or like an ember you still

00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,870
have to figure out how will you actually

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,910
do it because depending on how he

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:09,300
invested it will actually be a real

00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,950
success or I might be more of a very

00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,110
expensive investment that you don't get

00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,120
so many retransform so how will you know

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,650
how much earnest yeah first of all I

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,900
understand what your businesses are

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,150
trying to Tina and cater to them and

00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,500
thinking about areas that you want to

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,140
improve would be a product development

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,260
or training or branding you might want

00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:31,280
to employ different strategies either

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:34,200
with short mid term or long term returns

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,780
so let's take a look at some very

00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,460
specific examples of needs that you want

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,310
to meet in your business so you can

00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,240
actually choose the right strategy for

00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:48,330
the specific need when you try to

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,430
develop an OSS integrated strategy ed

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,620
your business so for example you had the

00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,960
need to fix a product did you actually

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,820
know that sometimes when the engineer

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,090
actually stumbles upon like a bug fix

00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,460
that you pay them to fix so your product

00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,920
can be sold to your customers again it's

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,590
sometimes not only about trying to

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,450
market patch this bug in the actual

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,130
application code sometimes it's a back

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,070
that actually originates with our party

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,900
library or it's just because a

00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:19,110
third-party library doesn't have a

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,850
feature yet that could actually be

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,100
available and would help you to fix the

00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,990
backend application and in this specific

00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,480
case for example it's actually rather

00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,250
easy for the engineer to say well I'm

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,020
not gonna ranking patches and I I'm

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,360
actually gonna provide an app screen bug

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,760
fix so a bug fix and actually fix this

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,330
the third-party library and in turn will

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,890
automatically fix your application with

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,730
the next

00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:47,090
memory and and they are actually able to

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:49,520
work on this without any kind of like

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,350
extra money or effort expended from his

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,760
side and this has really great thoughts

00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,110
of offering product a level of course

00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,940
because you just want to fix it backs

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,800
and this is what you want in the first

00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,900
place but also it's great training

00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,230
opportunity for any developers working

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:07,250
on this because they actually get a seed

00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:08,540
other great insights into the libraries

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,700
that they're using and this knowledge

00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,970
might be beneficial weeks or months or

00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,890
so something to keep in mind if you just

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,010
want to have like some kind of a

00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:21,770
short-term open source integration wins

00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:24,560
you can for example us engineers to try

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,990
to do it upstream back fixes wherever

00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,580
possible if you're really looking

00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,170
forward to improve the quality of your

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,560
products there are also different ways

00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:34,940
just meant he had like an internal

00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,980
library of functionality that you could

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,350
rather easily external eyes and actually

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:42,080
make an open-source add-on source

00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:44,240
project and all kinds of people from all

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,940
around other organizations could

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,350
actually help you to improve it the

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,060
great thing is once they actually share

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:54,020
the development that's usually much much

00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:57,910
easier to kind of like identify use

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,960
cases that are very interesting for the

00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,850
functionality or the project that you're

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,880
sourcing that you haven't been aware of

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:07,130
before and to also help you identify it

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,660
fixed box and fix so much quicker than

00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,850
if he would have continued with the

00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,860
development autonomy so if you go with

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,000
this route for example you realize okay

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,760
it's actually quite a little bit

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,070
investment to kind of like get something

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,510
which American ass so it can be non

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,040
source project we have to invest a

00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,900
little of engineering time to do that

00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,520
but once we've done this is actually

00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,220
like I'm very grateful time for us on

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,020
the product development side and not

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,240
spill at least also on the branding side

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,280
are the engineers are the organization I

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,590
use in your own sauce product you name

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,530
us gonna be out there for engineering

00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,870
teams and this is really great for your

00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:44,830
kind of

00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:47,440
marketing strategy here as well so great

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,060
wins in the mid and the mantra in las

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,490
colonies especially for like a small

00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,560
mid-sized oh and you as a company can

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:56,230
only grow with the help and support from

00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,660
others and this is what you want to

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,210
nourish as good as possible and if you

00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:04,330
imagine armed conflict has this point of

00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:06,220
view of tech user groups actually really

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,210
fulfilling the need then this is

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,540
something you should definitely look

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:13,750
into just imagine you had like a own

00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:15,910
local user group for my developers in

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,950
your town or maybe you sponsor a whole

00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,440
statement from an already existing user

00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:22,210
group every now and then the effects

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,480
that you have a manifold first of all

00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:26,530
you have a opportunity to Co network

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,930
with a lot of other engineers

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:30,940
organization around your area that are

00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:33,400
also using the same technologies issuers

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,140
and also if you get an added benefit of

00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,520
branding because when you fix them a

00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,740
sponsor when you for example house

00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,590
people will remember your name this is

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:45,370
something that can pay off already weeks

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:47,710
months sometimes years from now so here

00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,900
also great benefits that you get in the

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,360
long term both on the branding and the

00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,100
turn strategies side and which should

00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,600
also note the underestimated especially

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,120
follow telling strategy where you know

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,060
as a tech company might send us take

00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,880
quite a long time to hire someone so why

00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,760
not invest today and then get the

00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,940
benefits from it a couple months or yes

00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:12,910
or no so something to come and support

00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,590
your local Emma meetup and that many

00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,870
different ways that companies contribute

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,460
to open source right now so if you for

00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,530
example like a smaller company you might

00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,760
kind of try to tend to do more short

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,590
term investments for example these

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,960
upstream bug fixes that are talked about

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,070
or trying to collaborate an open source

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,590
projects that you're already using

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,750
because it's rather easy to invest and

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,790
stop the investment and go from there

00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,860
but especially if you're like a large

00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,880
organization maybe like more than ten

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:40,040
thousand

00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,810
members then you might realize that for

00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,930
example every stakeholder ship positions

00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:48,230
and projects trying to help on source

00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:50,540
projects to put the roadmap and to pace

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,000
them through it with the features that

00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,770
are relevant for your own business

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,520
product is something that you would

00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:00,560
really value and you know to give you

00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,690
some confident as well if you maybe

00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,670
already there to to make the choice that

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,290
you know okay maybe I should look into

00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:08,570
all the source and how we can deploy

00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:10,970
this in our business I want to show you

00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:14,720
in great company especially in the EMA

00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:16,700
community which is a framework or

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,920
project that is not backed by one single

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,120
big company but a lot of like different

00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,350
companies and organization and

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,850
individual contributors that come

00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:28,210
together to check the product you are in

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:31,540
yeah as I said very great company and

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:35,120
looking at a lot of like small mid and

00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:37,190
larger sized companies he might also

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,790
find very similar strategy said you can

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:43,790
adapt for your own business and yeah was

00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:45,920
this I think you have like a better

00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:48,200
understanding how this could actually

00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:51,110
play out and the higher quality products

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,980
more secure products but also more

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,720
effective and excellent teams as well as

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,480
the competitive app that you get in

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,130
sales and also your talent strategy by

00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,950
employing um source and your business

00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:06,830
are the things that actually gives us x

00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:11,480
z impact that is larger than just the

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:14,900
sum of its parts and yeah i think you

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,250
had a great time so it kind of like get

00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,160
a little bit like for insight together

00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:21,500
with me into open source and what it

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,650
means in the my ecosystem specifically

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:27,020
and maybe at this point my yappin a

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,790
little bit and actually come to the

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,560
conclusion that you can now actually

00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,770
make really great business for this

00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,520
business decision for

00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:39,080
so maybe even the best by investing in

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,970
ember and with this I would like to
