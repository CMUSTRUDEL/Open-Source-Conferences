Description: 
	Democratizing Frameworks Through Developer Experience by Sarah Yu

Improving the developer experience (DX) of frameworks is often something that is pushed aside for new features. The cost of not understanding how things work results in the misuse of frameworks, bugs and, most importantly, frustrated engineers.

This talk will explore the concept of DX through the lens of a former journalist. We will go over why having the lowest barrier to entry is important by democratizing development and providing access to information. We will also talk about the consequences of having subpar DX which creates an imbalance of power in the open source/developer ecosystem.

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,869
so today I'm going to talk about how

00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,210
improving developer experience is vital

00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,250
to making frameworks more accessible and

00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,070
also contributes to a healthy

00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,019
open-source ecosystem good developer

00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,449
experience helps brings engineers

00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:40,030
together from all levels toward the

00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:41,739
common goal of learning and my hope is

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,930
by the end of this talk you'll be

00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:46,330
inspired to work on developer experience

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:52,030
features or at least think about and

00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:54,519
appreciate the ones that you consume so

00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,890
I don't have a traditional CS background

00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:58,900
my training is actually in journalism

00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,210
and that's really shaped how I tackle

00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,119
and solve problems in the software

00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,979
engineering space I actually started my

00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,650
career out in Alaska at a public radio

00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,900
station where I was a journalist and

00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,369
also a web administrator so I was

00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,530
writing stories about shucking oysters

00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:16,600
and gardening while also making sure

00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,450
that the website didn't go down and

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,909
that's how I learned how to code and

00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,100
because of my past one helpful system I

00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:26,229
use is the classic who what when where

00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,770
and why thought process which I'm going

00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:35,049
to use in this talk to describe

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:37,840
developer experience so Who am I why am

00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:40,899
i talking to you about this I'm a UI

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,520
engineer on the economic graph team one

00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:44,409
thing that my team does is release a

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,929
quarterly workforce report that shows

00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,969
trends in the US labor market and this

00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:51,579
research is used by policymakers by

00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:53,350
academics by journalists so I feel like

00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,969
I've really kept a tie back to my

00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:58,149
original training by working on this

00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:00,729
team and like I said previously I

00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:01,929
started out as a journalist I really

00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,139
didn't have that much experience

00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:07,569
starting off on the job at LinkedIn

00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:10,539
three years ago I really ramped up on

00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:13,510
the job and when I was starting out

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,700
amber seemed really new and exciting but

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:21,280
also scary and not a lot has changed

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:23,680
since then to be honest so because of my

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,330
past I'm really passionate about working

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,730
with the reach apprenticeship program at

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,720
LinkedIn and this program helps

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,760
engineers from non-traditional

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,569
backgrounds start full-time software

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,079
engineering

00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:37,150
rolls and I really have to tap into the

00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:39,790
feelings that I had starting out all of

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,159
my fears everything that I struggled

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,189
with in order to empathize and mentor

00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,019
the apprentices and also now I have a

00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:48,670
lot of experience seeing people from

00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,409
very different backgrounds go into the

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,420
industry and how they learn and how they

00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:54,459
process concepts and this has really

00:02:52,420 --> 00:03:00,700
inspired me to work on developer

00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:02,439
experience so my main focus is on ember

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,290
data and the related add-ons

00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:09,129
particularly m3 which is an alternative

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,500
to DS model and when I started learning

00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,750
ember that was the area that I found to

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,780
be the most intimidating but also

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,030
incredibly interesting I distinctly

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,819
remember when I had to hook up my first

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,500
API endpoint at LinkedIn I was actually

00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,560
pair programming with someone on my team

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,810
because I was really stuck and honestly

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,680
I was actually on the verge of tears

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,480
because I was really feeling like I

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,209
didn't understand how anything worked I

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,859
was really struggling I kind of had this

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,109
feeling in the back of my mind that

00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,909
LinkedIn had made a mistake by hiring me

00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:46,780
it was one of those really terrifying

00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:48,699
moments early on in my career but I was

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,669
able to push through it I got a lot of

00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:54,430
help from really supportive people and I

00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:56,680
felt like this incredible joy when I

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,389
actually got everything to work and I

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,849
realized that I was actually learning

00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:03,040
one of the most powerful aspects of the

00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,129
framework and that was a incredibly

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,470
exciting to me and so that experience

00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:10,419
really motivated me to learn ember data

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,340
deeper because I wanted to make it

00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,469
easier for me to understand what was

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,530
going on and also for other people to

00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:19,239
understand what was going on and one of

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,820
the more recent features I was

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,250
responsible for was for for adding

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,740
support for m3 models and ember

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,479
inspector this was actually just

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:35,080
basically solving a pain point that I

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:38,050
personally had so what is developer

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,760
experience developer experience is how

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,949
engineers interact with your framework

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,240
it's really at the boundary between

00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,460
people and code

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,290
this can include documentation

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,910
which is the entry point for most

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,680
developers and probably the first

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,260
impression that they'll make of your

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,830
project if I go to a repo and it has a

00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,070
missing outdated or blank readme I

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,780
really hesitate to use the project this

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,880
also includes debugging tools which

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,230
engineers really appreciate and they

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,290
definitely remember if they're

00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,990
frustrating this can also include

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,400
framework ergonomics and developers may

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,350
not be consciously aware of good

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,810
ergonomics but they definitely know if a

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,810
framework has clunky or difficult syntax

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,920
so unfortunately developer experience is

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,420
often not prioritized and I believe one

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,120
of the reasons why is because it

00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,910
involves people and people metrics are

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,800
notoriously hard to measure it's a lot

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,200
easier to say that you reduce the build

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,990
size by X amount or sped up the website

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,120
by X milliseconds it's a lot harder to

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,870
say that you made developers work X

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,700
times faster with your feature and just

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,830
to be clear though developer experience

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,410
is important it should not come at the

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,730
expense of user experience ideally it

00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:00,310
should be a symbiotic relationship so I

00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,350
actually ran into this problem myself on

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,860
a feature that I'm currently working on

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:08,950
the concept of people metrics so I'm

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,130
trying to add a button in the data pane

00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,750
to output the store into the console and

00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,270
this is actually a feature that I wish

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,710
existed when I started out because I

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,600
didn't know that you could grab the

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,730
store off the container pane I didn't

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
even know what a container was I wasted

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,590
so much time putting breakpoints into my

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,660
code to dry try to grab the store it was

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,060
very frustrating but I didn't want to

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,910
build a feature that I just only found

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,610
useful so what I did is I actually

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,440
talked to a lot of developers from all

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,810
different levels I heard about their

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,870
pain points with ember data I also

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,210
pitched my idea to see if they actually

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,130
would find it useful and that enabled me

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,290
to gain a little bit of consensus and

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,700
traction so that I felt confident that

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,890
what I was working on was actually

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,770
something that people wanted and that

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,420
they would use and I'll be making a PR

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,690
for that soon so keep an eye out for

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,690
that

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,710
so why is DX important if a framework

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,960
has great DX it's a lot easier for

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,570
people to adopt it to contribute to it

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,270
to answer questions open issues etc and

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:19,150
this really encourages diversity and a

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,370
healthy open-source ecosystem if the

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,100
framework is a delight to use it really

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,470
makes for happier engineers if a

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,090
framework doesn't have good DX that

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,039
really limits the type and number of

00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,440
people who can adopt it and contribute

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:35,470
to the project etc this really can

00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,090
create conformity in the types of people

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,300
that use it and the problems being

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,849
solved and also if only a small number

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,949
of people understand it when developers

00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:47,169
are building out applications there's a

00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:53,289
greater risk of bugs being introduced

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:55,810
into the code and framework misuse if

00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,699
the beginner can only understand what is

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,220
happening by looking at the source code

00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,710
that is a failure of the framework and

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,720
they'll probably go and find something

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,750
else that's a lot easier to use they

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,430
don't have to use what you built and

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:16,840
luckily I'm not the only one who thinks

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:18,840
that this is a problem so when should

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,639
you contribute to developer experience

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,889
one great thing is that newcomers bring

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,560
new and very valuable opinions to

00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:28,330
developer experience new engineers have

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,550
fresh eyes and new insights into the

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,520
framework they know it's hard starting

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,190
off these insights are really lost the

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,779
longer you work with a framework and

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,940
people can contribute to different

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,010
facets of frameworks as they gain

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,980
experience and each of these ladders is

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,839
vitally important and as engineers grow

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,150
they should continue to contribute to

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,490
all levels of developer experience and

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,920
help new engineers level up and this

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,310
will create a self-perpetuating

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,380
ecosystem I also really encourage people

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,649
from non-traditional backgrounds to

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,360
contribute to developer experience I

00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:06,190
feel like there's a lot of pressure for

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,170
people from non-traditional backgrounds

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,240
to conform to the expectations of how

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,520
software engineers should learn and

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,380
solve problems but we should really be

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,660
using our unique backgrounds to make

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,550
frameworks and the open-source ecosystem

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:23,950
a more open and engaging place for

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:27,370
everyone so where can you actually

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,630
contribute one suggestion I have is to

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,600
work on features or missing

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,820
documentation that bother you or hinder

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,740
you and your day-to-day work this will

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,100
help motivate you to contribute and

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,970
you'll also directly benefit from it and

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,560
a lot of small one line changes exist I

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,540
personally have a huge pet peeve when it

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,580
comes to dead links whenever I see a

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,470
dead link in the code I'll make a pull

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,630
request when it's the repo to fix it and

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,820
this ensures the next person will have

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,470
access to the information and I've done

00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,410
this for Amber data for the octane

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,450
guides for Mirage so on and so forth and

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,490
usually those PR gets merged within days

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,960
and it really helps builds relationships

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,180
with the maintainer --zz at the very

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,940
least and kind of give you ramped up on

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,130
to the framework you can also add

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,810
examples of how to use add-ons so if you

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,910
start consuming an add-on and you kind

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,770
of struggle with a bit to figure out how

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,350
to get it to work you can create a pull

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,440
request in the readme with an example

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:25,360
and I've also done this with ember sign

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,610
on cue unit because like a lot of people

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,250
I actually spent a lot of time figuring

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,790
out how to test my code in addition to

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,800
writing my application code and as you

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,750
work on the framework more you can add

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,910
comments into the source code you can

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,430
work on developer tools like ember

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,580
inspector there are just so many areas

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,470
out there that are just waiting and

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,360
maintained errs really appreciate you

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,490
making these fixes even if they seem

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,620
trivial because honestly a lot of times

00:10:51,490 --> 00:11:00,400
they don't have time to take care of

00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:02,500
these themselves so hopefully now you

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,870
understand why I'm so passionate about

00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,530
developer experience and how important

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,270
it is DX is a great opportunity to help

00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,790
you learn more about the framework and

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,980
also to help others learn and if you're

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,440
inspired to work on developer experience

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:22,420
tools I'm more than happy to talk to you

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:25,260
about them just let me know so

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,260
