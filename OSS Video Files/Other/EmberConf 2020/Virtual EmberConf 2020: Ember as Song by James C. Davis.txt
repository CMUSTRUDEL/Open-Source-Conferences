	Ember as Song by James C. Davis

Songwriting and programming have much more in common than you might think and Ember is the perfect medium for demonstrating this. This talk will show you just how similar these two disciplines are by creating an Ember Octane app that is actually a piece of music! Components are our instruments and routes are our phrases! We’ll start with a simple riff and build upon it, piece by piece, the same way you’d develop any Ember app, only this is one you can hear! Come join me in building an app note-by-note and experience Ember in a brand new way!
