	The Moderate Programmer by Derek Gavey

The moderate programmer isn't mediocre they are exceptional. Moderate as in "avoiding extremes of behaviour" might be the most useful trait a programmer can possess. As programmers "extreme behaviour" is almost a given so we need to fight harder to find the right balance. Moderate programmers know where to draw the lines and when to step over them. Using real world examples we will demonstrate what makes a moderate programmer so effective and explore what we can all do to become more moderate.
