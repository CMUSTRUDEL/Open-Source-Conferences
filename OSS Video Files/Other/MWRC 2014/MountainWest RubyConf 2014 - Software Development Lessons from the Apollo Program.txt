Description: 
	By Julian Simioni

In August 1961, the MIT Instrument Laboratory was awarded the contract for a guidance system to fly men to the moon, the first contract for the entire Apollo Program. The word software was not mentioned anywhere. Six years later, 400 engineers were employed on the project writing software.
The resulting Apollo Guidance Computer is to this day a marvel of engineering. It included a realtime operating system and even a software interpreter. Despite weighing 70 pounds, it ran on only 50W of power. Only one guidance computer was present in each Apollo spacecraft, with no backups: it never failed in thousands of hours of space flight. Before the first work on UNIX or the C programming language had begun, the Apollo Guidance Computer had already taken men to the moon.
NASA and MIT kept meticulous records, giving us the opportunity to look back today on some of the pioneers of our industry, relive their experiences, and maybe learn a few things ourselves.

all right you guys hear me I can hear me

00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:34,080
sweet all right so it's true we're going

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,620
to continue the trend this talk is not

00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:43,340
about Ruby at all this song is about

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,180
space let's hear it for space all right

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,100
all right that's good it's four o'clock

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,059
on a Friday there was no guarantee any

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,160
of you would be awake um I love space I

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,370
love space exploration I have my whole

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,260
life i know i got into into a technical

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,820
field because i love space in space like

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,780
spiration i know a bunch of other people

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,410
did raise your hand if you know you did

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,570
well but a lot of people did exactly um

00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,550
I mean there's just so much that's

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,950
really really inspiring and if there's

00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,130
one thing above all else that inspires

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,540
so many people see Apollo program right

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,530
i mean we landed on the moon how cool is

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,869
that um and there are just so many

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,750
things that you can be inspired by I

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,340
mean there's a Saturn 5 rocket that has

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,340
millions of pounds of thrust and shoots

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,479
fire a quarter mile out from engines as

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:38,460
it's going into space right uh um that's

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,049
awesome um there's there's awesome math

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,939
for like orbital mechanics and stuff

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,060
right electrical engineers built awesome

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,640
awesome hardware to make everything

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,350
actually work astronauts were like the

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,180
best pilots at the time right there test

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,580
pilots for crazy stuff like the extra X

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,080
15 and then they went into space and

00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:59,189
they were brave and it was awesome and

00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,600
then you hear things like oh yeah and we

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,079
landed on the moon with with less

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,640
computing power than is in like my watch

00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,940
and that sucks I mean we're software

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,829
developers we want to hear awesome stuff

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,739
about software but no one ever talks

00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:17,130
about software any pilot program and so

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,780
for a long time I figured okay maybe

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,110
there really wasn't much maybe they had

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,489
some computer in the Apollo uh you know

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,530
capsule and it was just a bunch of

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:26,970
circuits and maybe it was smaller than

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,280
anything else that came before it and

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,859
you know it probably wasn't pretty and

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,790
it probably wasn't programmable and but

00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:35,739
that's all wrong um

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,510
there were there was an incredible

00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,469
amount of software development effort

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:43,290
that went into the Apollo guidance

00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:45,459
computer and it is just awesome um so

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:50,890
that's what it looked like it's not very

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:53,620
pretty um but and it's not very fast it

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,620
is true a double-precision

00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,639
floating-point multiply took one

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:05,109
millisecond I did some rough math my

00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,489
little computer over there compared to

00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:08,739
the Apollo guidance computer it could do

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:14,650
all of the computation done in all the

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:18,340
Apollo missions ever in one second but

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,950
but I'm not even sure that that thing is

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,859
going to last through this talk whereas

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,189
in all the Apollo missions the Apollo

00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:28,750
guidance computer never once failed it

00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:30,609
hits some known bugs they had to do some

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,500
crazy workarounds but there's never once

00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:36,700
any sort of failure and that's pretty

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:41,949
awesome um let's see what was I going to

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:45,250
say next um what's even more amazing is

00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:46,659
that it's not just a bunch of little

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,729
circuits that that are pre-programmed

00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,859
it's it's if you look at the hardware

00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:53,109
it's a general-purpose computer pretty

00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:55,150
much exactly like any computer we have

00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,010
today right it has an instruction set

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,099
that's really familiar it has Ram has

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,659
some read-only memory um programming it

00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:05,199
was was pretty much similar to writing

00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:07,569
assembly today um and what's even

00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,459
crazier is that they built all this in

00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:11,290
the 60s now to give you an idea of what

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:15,489
this means the project was started in

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:17,500
nineteen sixty one in 1950 software was

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:22,780
mentioned in a paper for the first time

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:24,520
the word software so before 1950 they

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,320
had written software but they didn't

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,460
really realize that this software thing

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,539
was going to be different than just

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:34,150
building a computer so Firefox is 11

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,050
years old when they built then they

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,930
started building the Apollo guidance

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:43,180
computer software was as old as Firefox

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:44,500
just think about that um in 1965 they

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,050
are about halfway through building the

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,560
Apollo guidance computer and and the MIT

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,389
instrument

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,940
lavis the guys had built it they got

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,960
this brand-new fancy computer to do all

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,650
their work on the ground it was called

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,120
an IBM system/360 now there's a certain

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,210
famous person who worked on that project

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,820
who knows who knows who it is that's

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:08,740
right what did he give us and when did

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:13,450
he write that 1975 so by then the pilot

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,710
program was all shut down um so all the

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,910
softer developers working on the Apollo

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,680
guidance computer were contemporaries of

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,419
Fred Brooks they're learning exactly the

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,290
same things and making all the same

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:25,030
mistakes to the exact same time in 1968

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,919
Apollo 8 was orbiting the moon with men

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,970
on board the polygons computer was

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,030
essentially done right they had some

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,650
work to do to to finish up for the other

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,910
missions right but the Apollo guidance

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:39,790
computer was feature complete 1968 in

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,440
1969 these two developers at this place

00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,479
called Bell Labs started working on this

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,729
new programming language it was called

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,520
see and they started working on this new

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:49,660
operating system it was called unix so

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,050
the Apollo guidance computer was done

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:57,310
before those we even started um that's

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,860
pretty crazy so what do you learn when

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,870
you build software in the 60s um I one

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,110
first ask you guys a question who has

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:07,630
built some sort of web app or system or

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,220
something that relied on someone else's

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,990
system right any sort of API or anything

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,539
like that and it was at scale pretty

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,600
much everyone okay and what happened to

00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:20,200
your system the first time their stuff

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:25,630
broke everyone's laughing yeah someone

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:29,080
made an explosion move exactly and

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,090
hopefully you got smart and later on you

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,280
were able to handle anything that this

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,690
other system breaking could throw at you

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,039
right and maybe your stuff didn't work

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,280
that great but at least it chugged along

00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:43,539
a little bit and you didn't look so bad

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:46,240
okay let's now talk about the pivotal

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,370
moment in the entire Apollo program and

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,440
that's obviously those first landing on

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,760
the moon during Apollo 11 so they're in

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,950
this guy so Neil Armstrong and Buzz

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,630
Aldrin Aaron here it's the lunar module

00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,760
they're orbiting their orbiting the moon

00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,740
and then they're they're starting the

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,390
descent towards the surface of the Moon

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,040
and the last couple minutes

00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,780
this like the the last 10 minutes or so

00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,920
is something no one had ever done they

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,720
had only gotten into a tight orbit

00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:13,480
around the moon for apollo 10 this is by

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,060
far the most workload heavy part of the

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:19,090
entire mission Neil Armstrong said on a

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:23,560
scale of 1 to 10 in terms of difficulty

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,700
he called a 13 so these guys are focused

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,290
right they're working hard they're

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,510
coming in they're just a couple minutes

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,030
from landing and then on their little

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,280
dashboard a huge thing lights up it says

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,360
like master air program alarms

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,330
something's wrong with the computer oh

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,860
no um and they're freaking out they're

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,810
distracted they fly like three miles

00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,030
past their landing site into a field of

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,200
craters which is no good back in Mission

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,810
Control everyone is freaking out they'd

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,960
never seen this particular error before

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,550
in all the simulations they did um there

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,420
happen to be a guy from MIT there who

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,160
had been working on the Apollo guidance

00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,900
computer and he had happened to have

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,400
been told beforehand that he should

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,320
write down a little cheat sheet of every

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,140
single error code that can be can be

00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:06,220
displayed and what you should do which

00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:08,020
is an extremely smart idea um and uh and

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,370
and he looked up the air code they had

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,960
never seen before in his note said as

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,910
long as nothing else looks looks wrong

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,020
then you're still go so he he told

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,040
everyone okay we're still go for landing

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,810
he actually got a medal from the

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:21,130
president for saying that um okay and

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,370
then we all know obviously they landed

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:27,160
on the moon so so what happened where

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,030
there is this this program alarm that

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:34,000
said the computer was doing something

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:35,470
wrong so in 2014 if you write some code

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,610
that does an infinite loop or something

00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,770
that uses way too much cpu on your

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,229
computer your computer will generally

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:46,000
not crash sometimes but generally not in

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:49,060
the 1960s it generally would the idea

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,460
that you could have one computer running

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,710
multiple programs you know interleave to

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,750
appear simultaneous they call it time

00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,120
sharing and it was first talked about in

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,640
1957 so the very idea that you could

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,710
have multiple programs running at all

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,300
together was extremely new the Apollo

00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,860
guidance computer did this I mean there

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,270
are programs to fire rockets there are

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,460
programs the fire thrusters their

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,160
programs to take input from astronauts

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,090
to display stuff to send data back to

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,940
vision control all sorts of stuff

00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,280
they're all different tasks

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,120
and now at the time almost every single

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,530
system that did this just whatever

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,850
program wanted to run they give it a

00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,200
little slice of time then move on to the

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,570
next one right very simple very

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,720
straightforward they call it like static

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,980
time sharing obviously our computers

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,240
don't do that today right we we give

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,830
everything our priority and then some

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,110
very smart very sophisticated logic

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,210
decides what we should run based on the

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,940
highest priority stuff right um the

00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,990
Apollo guidance computer did this to an

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,240
engineer some engineers at the time

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,740
hated this idea oh it's you can't know

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,590
what's running in a given time it's hard

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,590
to test well so it turned out what was

00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:56,070
causing that program alarm uh it was too

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,450
much cpu usage um the Apollo guidance

00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,000
computer was working really hard during

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,590
the landing to write it's calculating

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,780
the trajectory to go in it has to fire

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,180
thrusters at exactly the right time it's

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,250
sending back data to Mission Control and

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,380
the engineers knew this they calculate

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,700
it all out they said yeah during the

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,320
landing they'll be Peaks to about ninety

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,790
three percent CP usage but that's okay

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,770
we've got everything got everything

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,410
under control there was some other

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,420
hardware on the on the lunar module that

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,010
was sending a bunch of extra signals to

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,080
the guidance computer and causing it to

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,130
use like an extra ten percent CPU so

00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,910
right you can do the math and that's no

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:32,640
good um of course they were smart enough

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,630
to give this stuff already it was

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,890
actually signals from like the

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,120
rendezvous radar which they didn't even

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,530
use unless they were going to go back to

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:43,050
the command module if they were aborting

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:44,520
um and without that priority based

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,530
system right that was smart enough to

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,610
say here's the stuff that's really

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,780
important that we need to run if

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,060
something else happens to be running

00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,280
that we don't expect as long as it's

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,660
lower priority will just not run it and

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,400
everything will hopefully be fine they

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,780
hadn't done that they wouldn't have land

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,160
on the moon for Apollo 11 they had would

00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:04,589
have had to abort so the takeaway is

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,220
spend a little extra time make your

00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:13,200
system handle failure gracefully as a

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,600
side note if you handle something

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,550
gracefully and then pop up a huge error

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,980
that says program alarm and is super

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:24,360
scary you maybe could do a little better

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,920
Oh something like everything's okay even

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,560
though we're running a little low on

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,150
free CPU um

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,400
okay let's talk about something that

00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:41,250
hopefully we all love let's talk about

00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:42,390
testing yeah testing obviously lives are

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,850
at stake in the Apollo program they did

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,070
a lot of testing they did a lot of

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,020
automated testing they did a lot of unit

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,190
testing they even called it unit testing

00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,630
what they called it unit testing with

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,160
quotes because it was so new they didn't

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,700
really know if if that was actually a

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,500
thing um and and the engineers you know

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,820
they say yeah unit testing was great it

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:05,040
helped us it was cool um but they don't

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,839
they don't love it they didn't say it

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,730
was like the reason we land on the moon

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,070
was because of unit testing and I think

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:13,100
the reason for this um pretty

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,210
straightforward I should pointed out

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,430
when you write functional code it's easy

00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:19,200
to test well all the code for the Apollo

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,400
guidance computer was was functional not

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,980
in just the programming sense but in

00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,390
actual mathematical sense it was all

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,920
guidance equations right with inputs and

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:30,720
outputs it was easy to test and

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,610
furthermore in nineteen six in the 1960s

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,360
the computer science degree did not

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,980
exist everyone programming for the

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,810
apologia puter was trained in math or

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,790
had learned enough math to essentially

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,020
have a degree in math and so when you

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,780
put a bunch of mathematicians together

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,540
and you tell them to code up a bunch of

00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,780
functions that they know really well

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:53,330
they could generally do it um they also

00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,500
did a lot of integration testing and

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,780
when you read what they talked about for

00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,760
integration testing they loved it they

00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:03,150
said it solves so many problems it

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,070
helped them so much um in 1972 MIT

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,870
published essentially a retrospective of

00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,220
what happened during the software

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,250
development for the Apollo guidance

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,750
computer and they listed two things two

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,940
problems that they had for the entire

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,020
project that just just plagued them the

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,270
whole project and they didn't figure how

00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,290
to solve the first one was how to

00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:25,279
estimate schedules on how to meet them

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:29,120
uh oh and we have a little picture here

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,380
sorry um we have no idea how to solve

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,660
that today they had no idea how to solve

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,009
that then it's a hard problem um the

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,850
other thing that they said was really

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:40,240
hard is getting up-to-date specs and

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,060
requirements of other systems right and

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,440
that's hard we have a problem that today

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,440
but what they did discover is

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,240
integration testing can help you figure

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,949
out at least when you have this wrong

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,569
right when you write unit tests it's

00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:58,970
generally all your code or right someone

00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,139
on your team's code um but the whole

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,680
nature of integration testing is it

00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:06,199
someone else's code to and/or their own

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,060
hardware or something so you put a bunch

00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:12,259
of you put everything together you put

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:14,120
your whole system together and you see

00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:15,649
what happens right and if your

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,610
integration tests pass you don't

00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:17,930
necessarily know anything but if they

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,430
fail you know you did something wrong

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:24,319
and what you did wrong isn't necessarily

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,829
that you code is something wrong what

00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:29,990
you probably did is you made a a

00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:33,440
beautiful implementation of the wrong

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:36,230
thing you coded up something that was

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:41,480
great is perfect except that you didn't

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:42,949
know what to write um and so then you

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,209
can actually go out and there's no easy

00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,470
process for this right which is why I

00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:47,060
still a problem today that you can go in

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,860
and talk to the other people that you

00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,959
work with right the other parts of your

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,579
system and figure out which part either

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,160
got something wrong or which part you

00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:56,660
got something wrong about so doesn't

00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,839
cure everything but it helps so it leads

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,839
to a really interesting something I

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,279
hadn't heard before a really interesting

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,620
take away so you didn't test proved your

00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,699
code in integration test free

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,839
communication and we all know

00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,279
communication is maybe one of the

00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,360
hardest parts of software may be the

00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,660
hardest may even harder than running the

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,600
Asheville code so that's pretty cool

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:20,810
let's talk about their teams this is a

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:27,259
after Apollo 13 landed and everyone was

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:31,699
happy um so in 1961 the polygons

00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:33,410
computer contract was signed didn't

00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:34,339
mention anything about software they

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,279
didn't know they were going to have to

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:38,189
write any code

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,749
um pretty soon after that they realized

00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:44,180
they would and they settled into having

00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:48,029
about about 20 software developers and

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:53,930
these 20 software developers had no

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:55,920
managers no deadlines no requirements

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,769
very little communication with anyone

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,370
else and the reason is we didn't know at

00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:04,040
all in 1961 we didn't know how we're

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:08,519
going to get to the moon we didn't know

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,480
what even at a high level of a spaceship

00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,579
that goes to the moon would look like

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,430
would it be one big spaceship would it

00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:16,079
be two smaller space ships would be send

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,490
one giant rocket where we send two

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,069
little ones and then build a spacecraft

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:24,529
in space or something else no one knew

00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:28,410
um no one knew if you could with math

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:29,249
navigate yourself to the moon figured it

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,800
could be done but we didn't actually

00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:33,809
know how and no one knew even if we had

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,610
such math could we build a computer to

00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:38,209
do it so there's no point in setting a

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:41,639
deadline what you wanted to do was

00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:45,660
experiment and fool around and prove out

00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:47,850
all these concepts um a couple years

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,779
later we knew how are we going to get to

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,889
the moon we knew we were going to use

00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,879
two little ships one would be

00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:53,160
specifically for landing on the moon

00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:57,360
turns out it's a lot more fuel-efficient

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,759
um we knew that with a little sextant

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,019
just like sailors in in you know sailing

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,220
across the Atlantic or the Pacific or

00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,930
whatever they could you look at the

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,789
stars and the moon and angles and figure

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,120
out where you are and it was proven that

00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:11,549
you could use math and accelerometers

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,809
and get yourself in extremely precise

00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:16,589
orbits around the moon without any help

00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:18,720
from anyone else pretty cool and we knew

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,890
that if you use these new things called

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,419
integrated circuits you could build a

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,059
computer they could do all that math for

00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:28,740
you in such a way that it would actually

00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:32,460
all work so now around this time there

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,830
are 400 software developers and they had

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,669
lots of managers they had lots of

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:41,460
deadlines they had lots of communication

00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:43,260
and the reason is they were really

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,970
focused on getting specific things done

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,850
right JFK said we got to be on the moon

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,140
by 1970 so they had a pretty harsh

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:53,160
deadline right there

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:55,980
um last year if you're here Sarah talked

00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:03,690
about open and closed modes of thought

00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:06,090
right is that right sir um um in an open

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,320
mode year you're open to new ideas right

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,310
you're exploring and then closed mo

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,780
you're working to getting specific

00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,420
things done that butcher your talker is

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:15,330
that about it there you go she agrees um

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,520
that map's perfectly to these two team

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,550
sizes right early on you're just trying

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:26,940
to see what work and later on you're

00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:28,470
trying to get done um so it sort of

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,380
goes without saying make sure whatever

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,250
team size you're on is set up for doing

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,170
the thing that you need to do right now

00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,940
right no start up start with 400 people

00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:40,290
at least they don't last for long after

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,670
you and likewise we'd all be pretty

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,100
nervous if we found out that like the

00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:48,330
Google search team had 20 people that

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:51,360
would not be cool um aside learning from

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,880
this is switching between the small

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,570
scrappy team to the big like

00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,520
process-oriented one is really painful

00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,840
NASA complained like crazy when there

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,770
was a little really small team they said

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,220
you guys got to get your together

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:07,260
you got to get organized um when they

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,510
did get bigger a lot of the engineers

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,770
left they said we like it we like

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,610
exploring new things we like to flare

00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:17,160
around we like we like not having

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,300
managers after Apollo 8 a good number of

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,420
the engineers actually left and they

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,820
went on to the next thing but the point

00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,810
is we wouldn't land on the moon with 20

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,070
software developers the whole way

00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,420
through and we probably wouldn't landed

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,370
that in that moon with 400 software

00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,610
developers the whole way through so make

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:35,400
sure your team is the right size let's

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,490
talk about working with users I take

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,460
that back let's talk about working with

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:43,860
astronauts um who's seen the right stuff

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,820
or read the book great movie great book

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:52,610
how does it describe two astronauts okay

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:55,440
goofballs Cowboys right so they are

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,430
super confident super arrogant super

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,050
hard to work with they're just like

00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:06,660
software developers

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:08,370
um so let's so we all know a few things

00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,620
about working with users and there's one

00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,840
thing that really stuck out to me that

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,770
they learned really quickly and that's

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,570
astronauts just like any other users

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,570
don't know what they want there's a

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,430
great story that illustrates this the

00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,380
polygons computer was also an autopilot

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,610
right you could set it to navigate the

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,930
craft ground pretty much everything

00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,880
except the actual landing on the moon

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,260
that had to be done by a man because you

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,120
got to avoid boulders and stuff you

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:34,500
could probably do it now um so the

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,960
Apollo guidance people said hey

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,850
astronauts we um we can build you this

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,080
autopilot that'll do the reentry at the

00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,120
end of your mission for you right you

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,950
just press some buttons sit back and

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,080
we'll get you through you know the

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,030
atmosphere it's a tough it's it's it's a

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,590
tense moment right because if you if you

00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,320
come in too fast you burn up if you

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,700
don't come in steep enough you fly back

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,470
out into space it's no good but a

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,230
computer can handle that pretty pretty

00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,480
well it turns out estimates had trained

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,980
to do this and they said no we there is

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,680
no way some computer is going to do this

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,320
for us um the astronauts were really

00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,660
really just trustful of all forms of

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,970
automation computing even digital analog

00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,550
whatever a lot of them had their friends

00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:17,480
who had been killed in accidents in the

00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:20,400
50s and 60s and things like the x-15 so

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,580
sort of reasonable um but they said no

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,570
we promised every single one of us

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:30,750
guaranteed will manually do the entire

00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:33,980
reentry there is no way that we will let

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:37,070
some automated system do this for us

00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,810
they never ever use the manual reach

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,400
every single mission the first I take

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,950
that back the first mission they tested

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,060
manual entry for about a minute it turns

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,680
out when you've been in space in a

00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:50,910
little box for a week and a half and

00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,530
there's there's three minutes of work

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,000
that the computer can easily do for you

00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,670
between you and you know the warm

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,740
Pacific Ocean and and like real food and

00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:03,630
fresh air you're going to just press the

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:05,880
button and then sit back so really learn

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:08,520
that here's another interesting thing

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,070
let's say you've built a computer that

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,520
can navigate you to the moon right let's

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,540
say you've got

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,640
astronauts that are going to be in the

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,660
ship with you how do they communicate

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,950
with each other um keep in mind

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,650
human-computer interaction as a field

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,900
will not be invented until nineteen

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:29,100
eighty so you don't really know much

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:31,140
about working with users um you can't

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,420
use a CRT screen because they're too

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,560
heavy you can't use an LCD screen

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,770
because they haven't been invented yet

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,090
and again astronauts hate the very idea

00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,530
of automation they just want a joystick

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,220
that manually controls everything with

00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:47,400
actual cables not even like fly-by-wire

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:49,920
so what do you build in that case and I

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,780
want to show you what they built thanks

00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,780
to the work of some other people not me

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:57,270
who are very smart they've built a

00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:01,110
JavaScript emulator are we the entire

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:05,460
Apollo guidance computer and it's live

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:08,700
demo time who's excited yeah all right

00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,050
so in all its glory this is the

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,650
interface the Apollo guidance computer

00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:15,600
so what you get are three lines of

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:18,090
output that's all the computer tells you

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,170
about anything you get this stuff up

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,480
here that basically says what it's

00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,770
running and now you can do something

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,840
really cool so how you communicate with

00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,210
this computer is you you give it a verb

00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:35,280
and then a now so verbs are things like

00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:38,460
show me some data so verb verb 06 will

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,770
show you some data and then noun 65 is

00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,300
like the current system uptime so hit

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,890
that this thing's been running you have

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,390
to know by the way there's no decimal

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,860
point so you have to know what all these

00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,620
fields me they don't exactly get labels

00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:53,850
so this system is been running 40 hours

00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:57,570
20 minutes and 2.5 seven seconds okay

00:23:53,850 --> 00:24:00,180
let's run verb 1 6 this says show me

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:05,070
some data and then keep updating it and

00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:07,160
now I'm 65 and that was the exact same

00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:10,590
thing except every second it's updating

00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,780
so you've got this very simple system

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,070
that's still very powerful can be

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,510
entered stuff can be entered in quickly

00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,890
right astronauts or maybe under some

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,240
time pressure sometimes to make sure

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,710
that the spacecraft's doing the right

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,540
thing by the end of the Apollo program

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,130
the astronauts were so adapted this that

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,070
the end

00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:30,740
is where astounded and that's because it

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:35,450
gave you this really simple but powerful

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:37,250
interface now who here is reminded of

00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:41,870
something a certain program that we

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:44,120
might all use almost every day that has

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:47,290
verbs and nouns and other things and you

00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,290
can combine them in interesting ways

00:24:47,560 --> 00:25:00,530
it's them it's uh I have no idea I have

00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:03,080
no idea at all if if if this influenced

00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,460
the design of VI or vim VI was made in

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,980
the 70s and then them i think in like

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:11,090
the early 80s uh but i just think that's

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,100
really really cool you know still 40

00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,510
years later we're using essentially that

00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,430
same set as a concept that they came up

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:20,210
with right and i use vim every single

00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:22,700
day i love me some of them and i know a

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,830
lot of us do so i just think that's

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,950
awesome you guys definitely check this

00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,420
out you can actually like simulate an

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,140
entire launch and it's awesome but I

00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:39,710
don't have time to show it to you um

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:41,300
let's go back to the slides so you can

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,270
do like five seconds per slide instead

00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:48,260
of 10 all right okay let's try it let's

00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:52,070
try okay so there's a launch checklist

00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:57,860
let's open this thing up okay I did

00:25:52,070 --> 00:26:01,190
these two okay verbs 3737 says run a

00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,600
program and then we want noun 01 that's

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,410
like the pre-launch like make sure

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:14,140
everything looks okay program mmm nope

00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:19,760
didn't work it's reset verb 37 was it

00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:22,040
enter noun 01 nope i have i have more

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:30,980
okay i have multiple copies of this for

00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:34,090
this reason verb 36 noun 01 I think it's

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,090
supposed to splash for a second

00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,100
oh it's suppose to be calibrating

00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:45,659
something maybe it's taking a second

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:49,360
nope it says hold on I have another one

00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:56,070
mmm I have another one in chrome in case

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:59,559
I close all Firefox ok said verb 37

00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:00,940
enter 0 1 again HCI hadn't been invented

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:04,299
for another 20 years there we go so now

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,370
it says program one is running yeah and

00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:08,789
then this little thing this guy over

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:11,710
here is going to is going to calibrate

00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:13,210
any second now there we go so basically

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,899
the guidance configuring out where it is

00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:19,740
and then as soon as this switches to two

00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:23,049
let's go back to our launch checklist

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:27,220
major mode to the pre-launch thing will

00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:29,860
will happen ok we're in program too now

00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:33,580
you hit the launch button BAM and now

00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:35,770
this thing says the Saturn first stage

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,340
is firing and now this thing switches to

00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:40,960
I think this is velocity one of these is

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,580
altitude and other ones like downrange

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,080
distance and they're going up right you

00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,029
can imagine that we're gonna rock it and

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,679
it's all rumbly and you're being pressed

00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:49,659
to your seat and stuff it's not quite as

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,470
dramatic I guess when it's just a couple

00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:55,809
lines of text but you can fool around

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,190
this it's still pretty cool all right

00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:00,039
now we're really going back to the

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:02,500
