Title: Building for a Voice Controlled World - Developer South Coast - November 2017
Publication date: 2018-01-31
Playlist: Developer South Coast
Description: 
	Voice control is starting to gain momentum with Amazon dropping the barrier to entry to £35 for an echo dot and predicting 120 million Alexa enabled devices by 2020. Voice has been around for years but developments in machine learning has led to a reality of voice computing.
This talk brings a top level of how voice powered devices work, how to construct a voice experience (VX), highlighting the importance of interaction speed, each spoken word is the new 5px to the left. We answer the questions what do you do if people can’t pronounce your brand name or your audience spans 3 - 103 years old.
Technical we go through how to use amazon lamba vs sending the data to your C# Azure end point for processing and session state management.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,069
eighteen months ago we got one of these

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,200
at home and I've got a three or four

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:13,679
year old and a nearly six year old and

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:16,529
they just started talking to it so who's

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,940
got one of these or yeah and who and who

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,070
knows what they are and kind of what

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,289
they do and who has no idea and thought

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,670
this was some dating event with some

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,019
girl called look all the lexer and so so

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,660
basically we had one of these we put had

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:36,120
one in the kitchen and and the for the

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,800
for the first kind of few weeks it

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,480
couldn't understand my son but could

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,879
understand my daughter he got very

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,530
annoyed and then we'd ask her to ask it

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,370
things and you know all the usual stuff

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,320
like play music jokes knock-knock jokes

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,940
make fart sounds all the mature adult

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,059
things that we'd like to do and then and

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:59,370
then a few things happened so firstly

00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:02,280
they started being rude to it and not

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,300
saying please and thank you so and then

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,390
they started say not please and thank

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,159
you to us so we started having to build

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,290
this type of culture and I say well eva

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,360
is a robot and a machine because to them

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,360
it's a person there is someone very

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,130
small called the lexer inside this box

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,240
that they talk to and it's earning from

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,100
a kid's point of view you know the

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,420
fairies and elves and all these

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,659
different things like to them it makes

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,070
complete sense so they don't understand

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,119
that it is just a machine so so - and it

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,060
just clicked it's one of these things

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,890
that when you you know like a lot of us

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,049
in the room when people start sending

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,790
emojis and not texting or writing emails

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,100
and you know there's this generational

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,799
shift with technology and normally it

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,899
kind of goes from you know a youth

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,399
upwards you know as we go as you know

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,799
people phones and then it goes up and up

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,180
and up but with them what's this was

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,100
happening with the kids like this is the

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,659
next thing that's going to come but at

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,280
the same time I'd give him one - a

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,969
friend of mine one of the small dots and

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:07,590
he'd give it to his she's eighteen

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:09,509
eighty seven year old em now and from a

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,640
point of view of just urban how to turn

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,590
on the radio get kind of news and them

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,760
to think and it was and more and more

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,440
you hear these things actually I love

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,420
them being used for enhanced elderly

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,739
care because on the on your app fit on

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,750
the Alexa wrap you can see all the

00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,190
requests are going through so if you

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,840
don't hear it if it'll see anything the

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,000
list for a few hours or maybe a few days

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,110
then they're not asking it for things so

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,170
there may be there's something that they

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,019
need to look into so for the first time

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,060
a new interface is kind of hitting from

00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,069
both ends and coming from the elderly

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,650
and the youth and kind of eventually hit

00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,930
another peak you know if people in kind

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,370
of the thirties and forties which is

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,650
kind of never been known before which

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,360
kind of changes how we build things

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,190
because as you build stuff for mobile

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,410
you would you know older you know that

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,880
the rule is come out and then all the

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,200
games come out and there goes on but

00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,470
actually now we're having to build

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:03,230
elderly care apps and also fart sounds

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,790
and it's not just obviously at home

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,610
voice is kind of gonna be you know in

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,959
the house in the office you know more so

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,579
in the car especially now since you

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,190
can't legally use your phone in the car

00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:16,230
it's it's in it it's continuing to go

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,440
but it's all going to eventually

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,040
congregate on your person so things like

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,280
air pods

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,930
you know the wireless earbuds and

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,340
eventually kind of Apple spectacles that

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,310
no doubt will be out in a few years all

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,989
these things will produce things AR as

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,190
well as give you auditable responses for

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:39,150
you to talk to and for you to hear

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:40,170
things in their real time at the moment

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,180
we're in this position we're obviously

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,849
elixir is the well-known first speaker

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,389
and Amazon o extending that range but

00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:49,919
also if you lock in the Amazon app our

00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:53,099
lexer is built into that so you can

00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,470
search for things via voice and Google

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,980
announced earlier this year that a high

00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:01,169
percentage of their what would you say

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,220
hat what percentage of Google searches

00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:10,680
globally would you say about voice just

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:12,239
they're in a percent twenty yeah so

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,090
twenty percent of Google searches are

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,400
voice which kind of and you can see it

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,349
now where the voice icon inserts

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,299
becoming more and more prominent and

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:22,530
kind of evolving now a lot of that

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,630
obviously is coming from growth in

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,770
foreign markets where populations are

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,230
younger and therefore that becomes the

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,730
default way of working

00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,700
you know as these things go on it

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,640
continues and you know we're seeing this

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,680
change like an Alibaba publish their

00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,400
singles dating results I don't feel so

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,610
in China singles days xi xi and and they

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,210
recorded 25 billion dollars worth of

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:49,280
sales black friday in the US last year

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,860
was 3 billion of which 40 percent were

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,690
mobile and in china i rubbers Resorts

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,910
was 90 percent of mobile so 9 percent

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,620
about 25 billion was joined on a mobile

00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,270
so you can see over the next kind of

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,370
maybe 5 it might be as far as 10 years

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,980
but that kind of sway is gonna end up

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,570
going into things like Voisin as well as

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,590
potentially AR and VR as time goes on

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,920
and then you kind of gotta ask yourself

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,200
why wide voice and what's the benefits

00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,840
what's you know as we know it's not

00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,310
perfect at the moment and and and and

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,170
the simple things is you can do you can

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,490
multitask so if you're driving then

00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,560
obviously you can in it you can interact

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,240
with things with your voice and not you

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,430
know start rummaging around for stuff

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,630
but also if you're in the kitchen which

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,760
is obviously why these things live a lot

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,400
feel touching me and your cooking just

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,910
been able to stop music start music it

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,130
becomes this kind of strangely

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:43,490
productive tool for something that is

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,810
only a few words long and then what

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,280
we've what we've found is obviously for

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,930
them because we as a company we build

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,550
these types of things for businesses so

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,400
internal business kind of voice tools

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,490
and when you've got people who are in

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,400
factories you know mechanics surgical

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,810
environments your hands are busy you

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,850
know you don't want to have to be

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,140
picking things up both from a kind of a

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,090
cleansiness point of view but also just

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,180
as a distraction and if you're able to

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,090
use voice and get voice feedback then

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,620
you can carry on with what you're doing

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,420
and you know surprising that before we

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,130
had all this tech for the majority of

00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,470
history voice has been our preferred

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,050
communication method just between me and

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,820
you or boss versus me in a machine so

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,980
it's kind of you know it is in some ways

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:29,030
it makes sense to why both ends of the

00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:31,490
age spectrum are more aware of this than

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,120
probably am the majority of the

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:38,000
population and then the final thing is

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,920
obviously as you speak you get this

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,849
information quicker you can articulate a

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,429
sentence

00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:45,229
a lot more than you can in you know six

00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:47,240
dropdowns three buttons a few sliders

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:48,439
and if you can say it and it can

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,169
understand you with a great accuracy

00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:55,459
then you get that information a lot

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:56,959
faster and speech recognition obviously

00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:58,819
is been around for a long time everyone

00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,330
knows of you know dragon and I'm going

00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:05,029
to read six books to train it and put

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,110
with the you know that the improvements

00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:09,429
have happened over the recent years

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:12,139
Microsoft Research in June this year

00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:16,189
managed to get the lowest ever error

00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:18,559
rate of transcribing 25.4% I think it

00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:21,919
was and which is on par with with human

00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:25,009
transcribers so we'll get slowly to the

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,110
point where we get to the 98% kind of

00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:30,860
mark and that's when you know apart from

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,899
minor context they'll be no different

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,569
than talking to humans and you can see

00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:36,919
that if you've ever used the Skype

00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:40,339
translation real-time translation tool

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,259
at all it's surprisingly good so you can

00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,849
speak in English and then in real-time

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:48,349
the other end your translate it into say

00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:50,689
German but one of the biggest things is

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:53,539
that we don't have to read all the books

00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:56,209
now they've used you know transcriptions

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,469
of many conversations of people using

00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,079
the phone you know the reason why I look

00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:02,329
the likes of Google and Amazon enables

00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,029
you to have free phone calls is so that

00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:07,669
they could record and then transcribe

00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:10,849
and then train all of our algorithms to

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:12,499
then better improve the system and then

00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:15,529
obviously you can then walk in and and

00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:17,929
talk to it and they all know there was

00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:20,119
it's neither a mode there was a hidden

00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:23,779
option in the Alexa app where you could

00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:25,729
train further the application so that it

00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:28,129
could understand you more so what you

00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:29,779
might find is if you don't you so like

00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:32,899
in our house it couldn't understand

00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:35,089
Moana for a few weeks and now it will

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,199
understand my wanna even for things we

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:40,159
don't want it to be commenced I'll play

00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:41,419
in the mobile on a soundtrack so but

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,949
beat and then obviously amaz that came

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,110
along with this things what happens we

00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:47,389
have Siri for a long time and obviously

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,779
Google assistant and then Amazon came

00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:53,420
along again and made it 35 quid for a

00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:54,660
dot that you can put anywhere and as

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,220
well as it being a speaker

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,410
you just have to connect to the internet

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,000
and then you have this instant virtual

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,660
assistant which we never kind of

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,009
experienced before so if you've got any

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,759
questions as we go you can feel free to

00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:10,379
jump in and but obviously you know all

00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,839
that stuff so it would be cool to know

00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:19,470
how it works so the the device itself

00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:22,560
works on a activation would awake words

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,910
so part of that is who's freaked out

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
that it's recording everything and when

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,610
you eventually kill someone it will know

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,709
everything you have done so so basically

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,089
this is the fear is that is finding the

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,639
data saladin and obviously people are

00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,620
checking these things all time and what

00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,879
happens is it has a local processor on

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,009
and it's just looking for these wait

00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,079
words sometimes it gets confused because

00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:45,329
you'll see it that if the a word is

00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:46,620
mentioned on the TV and they'll pop up

00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:50,250
and start lighting up or if there's just

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,329
some background sound but if you earlier

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,220
in the year

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:56,730
Amazon got kind of subpoenaed or at

00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,379
least some data about and device that

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,470
was in someone's home that there was a

00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:02,130
potential murder charge against and they

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,180
were like well we haven't got

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,680
information so we can't give it to you

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,569
anyway which kind of helped vindicate a

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,880
bit and surprisingly that out of that

00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:11,790
scenario the thing actually ended up

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,519
with the conviction was the smart meter

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:19,069
for the water pressure because you don't

00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:23,100
pose your driveway down at 3:00 a.m. so

00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:24,360
so so you know you've got to be vigilant

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,430
at this stuff at the end of the day you

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,779
know just because it's not recording

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,850
everything now doesn't mean it won't my

00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,439
facebook released one just assumed it

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,430
will record everything you say so the

00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:34,050
weight the fear the key were the weight

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,060
words is they make them all three

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,110
syllables to try and mitigate it misread

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:45,329
reading so it's a lexer computer Amazon

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:46,920
and echo so that's the first bit which

00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:48,990
is to kind of stop you from opening

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,279
accidentally and then there's kind of

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,360
these starting phrases so these are

00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:58,680
things like open star play tasks and

00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,079
they they kind of arguably from it from

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,600
a lexer point of view and the Amazon

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,130
services they give them an insight into

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,050
what they want to give you general

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,310
knowledge on with regards to your own

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,150
application

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,710
you kind of don't access to this all you

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,410
know is that your application has been

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,840
kind of initialized and then you have

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,180
what is known as skills so skills are

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,220
basically small apps and skills are a

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:28,170
way for you to build some custom

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:30,870
functionality for a foreign application

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:33,330
and then and utterances is the variances

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,779
of sentences which will break apart in a

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,450
second

00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:42,060
the key thing on there on the skill side

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:46,860
of thing is they are only kind of unique

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,300
to your device so you could have someone

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,070
could build a skill called South

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,140
Hamilton and then someone else could

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,190
build a skill for South Hampton and as

00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,750
long as you didn't have both on your

00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:58,970
device you could they could both exist

00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:01,710
in the world so there's no there's no

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:04,080
this is not like you you're millions

00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,240
calm type of thing that you have to kind

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,700
of start taking care of and that being

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,680
said if they for if you do try to put

00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,460
anything in there that is a brand you

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,980
have to verify that you have access to

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,850
it which is why ours will not be called

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,350
and therefore so and then and then an

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:28,440
utterance Oh an utterance is basically a

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:30,630
sentence and the sentence is the request

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,580
the thing that you want to do and

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,470
basically what happens from an

00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,480
utterances is it takes in the audio that

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:40,890
basically you're sending through the

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,300
device some cloud magic happens through

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,190
Amazon's where it's taken the audio

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,470
running it through a natural language

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:50,720
processor and then it is basically

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:53,520
converting it to text with a and with a

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,380
confidence score which is not visible to

00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,060
you and then basically you're telling

00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,339
get a list of intents you're telling it

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,830
the things that you expect the

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:04,620
application to do and then it will match

00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,029
that base to a probability score so if

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,470
you're if you've got in if you've got

00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:12,480
all Torrance's such as tell me a fact

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,550
you basically load in with all the

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,070
variants that you can think of for that

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:20,280
request and that just gives you a better

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,610
way to for it to understand what you're

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,630
trying to say and how

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:27,519
can work now within the utterances you

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,410
have these things called slots and slots

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,959
are built-in and custom so we think of a

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,279
slot so instead of saying and tell me a

00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,779
fact about Bournemouth tell me in fact

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,690
about Southampton tell me about that

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:40,930
Winchester and there are built-in slots

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:43,690
that you can say tell me a fact about

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,209
City and then you get a full spectrum of

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,430
all the cities countries and there's

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:50,290
things like first name surname when it

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,029
comes to date you don't have to say all

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,260
the variant or dates you can put a date

00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,660
plug in and that will pick up things

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,579
like today yesterday last Friday a week

00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,740
on Tuesday a specific day and time a

00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:01,360
year ago and that and but from a

00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,709
developer point of view all that

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,529
information comes back to you in a

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:10,180
strongly typed date object which you can

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:14,970
then obviously use how you wish then

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:18,130
there is this thing called SML @s s ml

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,760
which is a standard across all voice

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:24,310
systems and what it is is a way for you

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,680
to then program and add some kind of

00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:34,240
personality to the voice as it goes back

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:35,800
out so for example you can tell it to

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,990
whisper you can tell it to add more

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:44,470
emphasis you can put spaces in between

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:46,089
things you can play audio in between its

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:50,170
same things so you can send a stream of

00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:52,959
media and that is basically an XML kind

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:56,050
of DSL type thing but it becomes this

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,930
thing that you can you can construct

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,810
this output from the import and generate

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,810
all these utterances and you can you can

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,850
build this application the the ones that

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:10,800
are the most kind of successful or a

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:15,399
simple quick and obviously informative

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,740
but there are different ways in which

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:21,730
you can do it so an interaction should

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:24,459
be under eight seconds in your ability

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,230
to gain some value and you have either a

00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:28,329
single action or a conversational action

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,800
so a single action is as clear as what

00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:32,230
is the weather what time a bomber

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,180
playing tonight and obviously more

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,370
conversational is where you would prompt

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,740
and

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:39,170
for different things so what is there to

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,330
drink then it could be like tea coffee

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,279
or chocolate as I would you like milk

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,890
would you like sugar and then what

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,990
happens is that bolt-on of sentences

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,180
yeah you can hold session within that

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,690
and therefore build up a kind of history

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,760
of the conversation that is there's been

00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,700
is being constructed and then enable you

00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,890
to signpost as you go through and from

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,870
from you know if you've seen any of the

00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,850
alexa right you can see the stuff that

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,620
it's doing it's things like turning off

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:19,360
lights put your music on for example

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:19,360
elixir play them on a soundtrack artists

00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:32,110
Alexa stop music and but you can have

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:36,589
things where within this that you can

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:38,480
you can like wait basically waste iron

00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:41,060
to kind of use it from a business point

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:46,160
of view so play music turning lights off

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:48,250
and is all well and good but if you

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:53,420
wanted to do something like for example

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:56,470
my wife will hate me for this so we have

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,470
Hugh light bulbs in our house

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,529
and most of them are on right now and

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,939
even though we're here and the Wi-Fi is

00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:08,449
connected it all obviously goes up to

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:12,890
there so I can say Alexa turn off all

00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:16,850
Hugh lightbulbs sorry I didn't find all

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:25,329
Hugh might bulbs Alexa turn off Hugh

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:36,380
light bulbs Alexa turn off hue lights

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:38,030
okay yeah so that'll look Dana said well

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:44,330
basically I'll get a phone call in a

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:48,370
minute and and that and that is that is

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,370
some anger no but I get sort of

00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:01,289
it's fleshy and but it's quite you know

00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:03,149
it's quite funny but but what it is is

00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,309
it it's Airy it's something which seems

00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,359
massively overkill rather than just

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:07,039
getting up and turning off a light

00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:09,570
switch

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,869
but what happens is you you get used to

00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,179
it

00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:13,470
you know we my wife and daughter left

00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,850
the house my wife was going around turn

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,009
all the lights off the other day and she

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,269
just turned her and said are you still

00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:21,389
with dad this and just say turn off all

00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:22,619
the hue light bulbs so and that's what

00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,239
happens that you leave the house you

00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:25,919
just you just do it and it just gets

00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:29,519
more and more can't you just get used to

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,889
it is what functionality it can do and

00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,809
then you know I'm linking one up to an

00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:35,539
IR blaster so we can turn like the TV on

00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:38,239
and put Netflix on three voice because

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:40,980
TVs rubbish and what do it automatically

00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:42,119
but but for us then we started looking

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,590
at how we could use these things in

00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:48,749
business and could that be could we have

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,639
the same kind of home and consumer kind

00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:52,679
of effect but but you know in a work

00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:54,269
environment and it's no different you

00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,970
know if you we have access obviously for

00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:59,369
API is to HR systems account systems and

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:02,249
training programs etc and you can start

00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:05,429
doing things like you see on here and

00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:07,649
they again that they all seem quite

00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:09,029
small may seem minor and it seems you

00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:10,529
know what you know I can just

00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:12,629
right-click on our thing and send an

00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:15,029
email but it comes back to the thing of

00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:16,619
you know we used to do 90% of all work

00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,960
on the laptop and now we do 50% of work

00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:20,970
laptop and 50% on a phone and over and

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,279
over I tend to magic hair tension pants

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,279
pain gets shorter and so does our

00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,470
patience let's say and to get things

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:35,989
done kind of more in a more kind of

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:38,940
multitask type of way one thing that we

00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:42,269
started of started creating is using it

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,470
as a training tool so you can like

00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:45,480
record background sounds of like a

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,220
factory instead of doing classroom

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,529
session and going in on site into a

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,149
factory you basically do your your

00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:52,499
on-site training or through the device

00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,409
and it'll play background sounds and

00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:56,669
it'll you know I'll ask you a question

00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,840
but a pipe or burst in the background

00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,149
and then you have to react with an

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,830
environment because that gives you a bit

00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:03,090
of a psychological change from sitting

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,009
in the classroom just filling in a piece

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,590
of paper to being on obviously on the

00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:08,070
floor

00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:10,600
as a health and safety skaters going on

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,669
again all for 35 quid which for the

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,559
customers training programs it's pretty

00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:17,740
cost-effective at least in an interview

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:22,720
stage if nothing else but obviously it's

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:25,270
not perfect because you know and that's

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,490
where kind of the improvements and where

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:30,400
we've found are things to really look at

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,650
which are people ask for things the same

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,059
thing in many different ways

00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:41,230
the classic one Amazon choses a loser as

00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:44,140
an example is 40 so is that 40 the

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:47,289
number we're gonna meet for tea we're

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,760
gonna get four teas to play golf you

00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:51,789
know and all these things kind of you it

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,169
goes on and on or 14 you know that and

00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:55,000
that and that's just even as you speak

00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,559
you know and then if you look at it from

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,799
a cultural point of view and in

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,659
different countries the you know the

00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:04,360
utterances you have to really kind of

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:06,039
build out is a mapping of what you're

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:11,230
going to ask in the right context around

00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:13,480
it and whereas on the device you so for

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,899
example what we said and we had open

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,350
that the nerf war game and you can also

00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:21,399
just say a lexer so say for example you

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,340
had a weather app called

00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:27,940
cold weather you could say Alexa open

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,830
cold weather Alexa now tell me the the

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,799
weather for Bournemouth but you can also

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:35,679
say Alexa what's the weather on-call

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,480
weather really bad example of name but

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,190
but you don't have to kind of initiate

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,470
it in that way it will kind of look

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,240
through all of the utterances and if a

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:48,370
sentence goes in it will try and match

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,020
it to the born it can but accents we

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:54,399
tried it with a company Newcastle it did

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:56,049
not work background noise so they work

00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:57,159
really well if you're in an office or if

00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:59,350
you're a medium room where there's no

00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:01,470
you know no noise we tried one as an

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:05,169
information type booth you know with

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:07,750
passing footfall and it you know it gets

00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:09,070
annoying it doesn't quite work because

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,890
it picks up other sounds now that

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,679
stuff's improved think it has a six

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,390
microphone array inside and if you speak

00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,360
what you'll notice if I say from here

00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,740
Alexa you know if

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,150
likes where it thinks the sounds coming

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,710
from and what it will do is it will turn

00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,690
off the speaker microphones from the

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,940
other side of the device to try and

00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,280
minimize the noise as it tries to direct

00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,500
it and then multiple voices so if you

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,940
speak or I speak at the moment though

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,350
they'd release something in the last few

00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,840
weeks where they can start to

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,190
differentiate between who's asking and

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,429
then obviously you can you can just say

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,080
set the mood you know my preference or

00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:46,000
change the light that's how I like and

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,070
they all know it's you and versus

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,650
obviously children or your partner or

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,750
work colleagues the hope with that is

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:57,330
also from an API point of view is the

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:59,980
you get access to some kind of user hash

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:03,460
so you can then obviously hold that

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,640
conversation in state so basically

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,890
there's a Cortana type speaker and

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,840
someone speaks in in French and then

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,130
someone gets a response in German and

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,610
then they speaking in English and you

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:17,770
basically get this multi-language a

00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:20,530
conversation happen between like five or

00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,600
six people and but and the API so freely

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,880
available to do that we've used them and

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,669
they work quite well the amazon have

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,100
really cornered the the consumer love

00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:33,010
for their device especially where they

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:38,919
keep obviously slashing the prices on it

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:41,590
in particular now one thing like with

00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:44,770
all technology once it works and it

00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:47,980
looks good everyone always wants to move

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:52,840
it five pixels to the left so in voice

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,860
it's no different so what happens is so

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,910
we went through a process where we

00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,740
started playing around this stuff and

00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,540
then people started liking it so we'd

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:02,049
say oh we do want to build a voice skill

00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,130
and they'd go yeah cool so they'll be

00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:05,080
like so what you wanted to do and then

00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,090
we like welcome to this ok so there are

00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,679
five meetups coming up to conferences

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,390
three training days and a partridge in a

00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,490
pear tree would you like to know more

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,780
which is basically the same as when you

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,549
ring the phone system now it's like

00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,470
press one for sales for us to this and

00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:19,630
it's just not intuitive it doesn't give

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:24,429
you it's not saving you time which is

00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:26,200
the whole point of voice but there is a

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,809
way kind of around it and this is where

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,840
I think the developer scale is gonna

00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,770
differentiate one voice skill from the

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,149
other

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,890
because the context around it is

00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:37,690
everything for example the first time

00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,179
you use it what you might want to do is

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:43,690
instead of saying all of what it is you

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:46,539
just say this voice skill is a meat or

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:49,270
for.net developers how can you help and

00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:50,409
then the second time it gets used maybe

00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,750
the first time they asked about a

00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:54,070
conference so therefore you can kind of

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,470
assume or give them some information

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:58,330
about the last thing they said and then

00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,559
where you're then saying do you want to

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,360
know more about this and then it's a

00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:05,320
simple yes/no and the short of the

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,610
sentence is the more the more likely

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,039
you're going to get a positive kind of

00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,419
like lack of confusion but then you can

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,980
give them out and you can say but or

00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:14,770
would you want more information about me

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,059
up so training and then if you know the

00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,590
meetups tomorrow and you can kind of you

00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:19,270
can build up this context around how

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,860
it's being used which gives it more of

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:25,120
an assistant and more of an intelligence

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:27,850
based thing and that is not what is

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,470
happening now and this is what is kind

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,090
of it will come and if anyone's looking

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,799
or is playing with voice girls at the

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,120
moment and from what we've seen like

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,890
this is the stuff that's going to

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,480
differentiate because everyone's good

00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,919
like you will do it after the break and

00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,659
you'll see how quick it is to build one

00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:42,190
of these things but it's the stuff

00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:46,539
behind it that gives it the relevance

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:49,000
and makes people feel feel kind of like

00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:50,529
there's some intent you know and

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,789
eventually like obviously if you after

00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:53,350
today and you'd listened and then it

00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:54,429
would just it can queue you up in you

00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,230
know even to the point of doing like

00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,850
would you like to pay or I'm sure rich

00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,409
would love it if it could like say your

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,230
subs are up give me some money right now

00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:03,520
but but with this it then comes back to

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:07,000
you build your skill you've got some

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,950
sentences it's all good and but will it

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,260
work will people ask how you want it

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:13,870
people to ask and that's where training

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,779
comes in and so we so we've worked with

00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:21,399
a few companies on this now and how it

00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:22,960
typically has gone is you treat it like

00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:24,850
more you treat a voicing more like a

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,799
chatbot type of thing which is like a

00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,570
question announcers and it's quite kind

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,960
of procedural kind of like a live chat

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,950
EQ but that's not really fun so first of

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,130
all we'd kind of give them a piece of

00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,929
paper and say you know give us all the

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,580
questions you want it to answer so they

00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,639
do that we then get all the answers we

00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,409
put it in and then this happens no we

00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:45,639
don't want it to be us like that some

00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:46,510
people ask it like this some people are

00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:48,520
Sartre I bet

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,740
and then what happens is over time you

00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,510
just get like 20 variations of each

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,160
question which obviously go into all

00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:57,460
these different kind of spider webs of

00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,930
connections and it gets a bit messy or

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,730
you change it so then what we started

00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:02,740
doing is had conversational sheets and

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,470
this is what you'll get from if you went

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,060
to like at Amazon lexer event you have

00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,640
these conversational seats as a speech

00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,820
bubbles here and speech bubbles here and

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,040
again it's great but there is still an

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,650
element of your speaking talk maybe one

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,810
stakeholder or one person who knows a

00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,100
bit about the system and you're not

00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,320
speaking to the person on the ground who

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,350
actually is doing their job every day or

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:30,090
the user you know the 90 year old who

00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:33,670
wants to you know like so for example

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:36,070
the the nan of the friend and she's got

00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:38,590
a partial dementia and and one day

00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:42,760
basically on the list was like twenties

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:44,140
things of where's Tom so so she just was

00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,510
asking where's Tom waste Tom waste on

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,760
and which then becomes a flag of like

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:51,460
you know just understood sir Thomas like

00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,920
a I think like a brother or something

00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,260
from from the who passed away but it

00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:59,110
becomes this kind of ability to kind of

00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,880
gain insight into your users and within

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,670
the application you get this history of

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,380
what has been processed so you can find

00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,450
the things that maybe you've missed and

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,620
if you have access to that device in

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,900
them accounts so if you're going to

00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,100
pilot this stuff with anyone is I would

00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,140
recommend that you set of all the

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,910
devices deploy them connect them to your

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,980
account and then you can see the stuff

00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,890
coming through and Amazon I'll remember

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,060
to average or to give you access to that

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,430
through an API point of view so you can

00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,900
aggregate and they were going to do give

00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,900
you access to the original sounds

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,400
recordings but then the media got hold

00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,080
of it and everyone freaked out I know

00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,850
obviously this is very developer focus

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,380
but branding is probably something core

00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:41,680
which we all should think about so there

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,390
is no UI so no designers yeah from a

00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,640
branding point of view and what we've

00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,380
found now is because every time we want

00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,060
to play music so we've got Amazon Prime

00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,950
so it defaults automatically to add

00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,570
Prime music so if you want to play

00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:56,170
anything on Spotify you have to say a

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,100
lexer play this on Spotify so about five

00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,860
times a day you're saying the word

00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,960
Spotify what we found is that this

00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,450
the same way that now with my son the TV

00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,649
is not the TV the TV is Netflix you know

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,419
turning off lights is not turn off

00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:10,269
lights it's dimming the hue blobs so

00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:11,980
from a brand point of view where there

00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:14,529
is no UI there is no logo there is no

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,320
tagline your you better hope your

00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:19,240
company name is speakable because if you

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,990
can't understand it then you've got no

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:26,110
chance of brand awareness and if there

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:30,460
is no brand it's going to Amazon one

00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:34,299
thing which came which I which I which I

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:38,320
noticed a few weeks ago is there's a an

00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:40,539
artist who called logic so I'm familiar

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,980
with this song so this is the name of

00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:47,200
the song okay this is also a phone

00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,320
number so basically the the song itself

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,130
is a razor brown kind of quite a low

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,510
suicidal kind of reflection song and the

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,730
phone number is the suicide prevention

00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:00,880
hotline in America so they're obviously

00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,649
from a so in today's society where we

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,960
listen to music through your phone and

00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:07,299
through laptops showing the phone number

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,649
is awesome you know he slowly embeds

00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:09,880
into people you know if you're ever

00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:14,350
against that point you have some

00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,929
visibility of where you could call try

00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:19,269
and say that to Alexa like it's not it's

00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:21,220
not going to work you know so what you

00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:24,850
would say now is you'd say play logics

00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:27,039
latest track on Spotify and what you

00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,690
kind of potentially if you know if voice

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,799
was the prominent techno you've got

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,450
you've got to go to other market and

00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,130
where the most kind of obviously impact

00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,419
is going to be but if for each does gets

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,039
the point where it becomes the prominent

00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:37,840
interface for this type of thing you'd

00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:41,279
probably want to call it logic NS PR

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,279
which is the national suicide protection

00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,399
lifeline I think they call it which then

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,080
just slowly builds off that kind of

00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:50,710
awareness but it just shows it's just a

00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,000
sense of remembering how to brand the

00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,980
things you're going to build with how

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,450
people are going to ask for a or how

00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,769
they're going to proceed it everyone

00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,179
gets freaked out by security especially

00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:00,669
business with this stuff because it's

00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:03,269
sending voice and you know we built a an

00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:05,470
application for a C suite a big

00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:07,870
multi-billion pound company to be able

00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,429
to query data and like what you know

00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,260
being quite careful with what gets

00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:13,179
translated and there's a little context

00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,390
around it but the context is relevant to

00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:17,260
the

00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:19,390
and listening to it you know if you've

00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,670
got a device in an office which has the

00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,650
you know net you know apples next

00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,990
earnings and you can just go up and

00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:28,240
listen to it and then leave you know you

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,380
could make a few quid so they you know

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,360
it's eventually they'll get to a point

00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:35,020
where they can fingerprint your voice so

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:39,670
that you can so that they can identify

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:42,370
you that being said you can get a user

00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,260
identifier a user identifier and also a

00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,809
device identifier so you can block

00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,540
access and from if you're not if you're

00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:53,620
using say as your to store the skill and

00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:55,179
you can certificate you cific at the

00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,370
communication but then you can obviously

00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:59,919
then block out devices and have that

00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,330
kind of management or a user level and

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,919
then what we started playing around with

00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,780
was the ability to use what we call in

00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,980
clever passwords so this is where you

00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:11,440
kind of train it to say when you ask me

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,809
a maths question it's to off the real

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,309
answer times the current date like that

00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:16,960
type of thing so it would change every

00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:19,080
time you would ask it and but that's

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,100
more just in until we get to voice

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,419
fingerprints but you've instead you know

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,220
some record your voice and plays it back

00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:26,230
you know and all then things have to

00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,679
play a part with it that's grandma's own

00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:32,280
first

00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:35,860
so so basically a think of a skill as a

00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:40,780
as an app in the simplest form and what

00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:43,030
you would do is so we let's say we would

00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,770
come up with a skill and I was I was

00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,620
hoping we could have bought built a

00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,360
swank one for the night but and let's

00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,260
not get too adventurous and let's go

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,330
with something that kind of already

00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,820
works but we could walk through the end

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,350
of how we potentially would make it so I

00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,620
wanted to walk you through is one which

00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:01,780
is an earlier prototype of basically the

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:05,350
nerf war game and just to give you an

00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:07,720
idea of how that works so and there are

00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:11,919
two ways to build a skill one is to use

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:15,940
an AWS is lambda technology or to use

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,740
kind of a gtps endpoint and the land of

00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,510
stuff is what amazon craves about and

00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,760
talks around so it's quite easy to find

00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,169
information now about that so I'll kind

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,660
of leave that alone a bit but just to

00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:26,950
think about it in the way of its AWS is

00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,840
way to do service technology

00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,580
you can just kind of do a lot of

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,080
wizardry type stuff and then you can

00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:37,090
write JavaScript c-sharp

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,399
- etc and just upload kind of like a

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:42,730
function based language and access all

00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:46,210
your AWS resources from there and the we

00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:50,049
build 99% of the ones we've done a

00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:51,880
Bonnie one really using the HTTP rule

00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:54,039
there way and because a lot of our

00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,740
clients have it within an agile and they

00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:57,909
want to keep in there you don't expose

00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,669
databases to the outside world they just

00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:06,519
want to expose her I secure as they can

00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:10,240
get em and to Alexa so so basically how

00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:13,389
it works is you define some information

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,010
so you currently and it's expanding all

00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:16,810
the time but at the time of when we

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,119
started doing this stuff there was US UK

00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:21,190
and Germany with the three main

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,530
countries and recently they've now

00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:26,260
expanded a lot to India they expanded to

00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:30,310
Canada the other day so Amazon's mission

00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:32,440
is to have Alexa working in any country

00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,020
that Amazon operates because then you

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,179
can buy stuff so help with their

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:43,060
question go to the help and feedback

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:44,050
section of the ILECs what up so and if

00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,260
you buy one of these and you're gonna

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:49,210
use it at dev just call it a code so

00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,569
what you do then is obviously you give

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:53,290
it a name and then you give it a kind of

00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:55,149
invocation name which as you can see

00:34:53,290 --> 00:35:02,010
here and these can obviously be be

00:34:55,149 --> 00:35:02,010
anything this is problem parem

00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:11,790
so better cool so and then from here you

00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,900
get you know the this so if you want to

00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,339
publish it on to the store you have to

00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,050
go through kind of certification they

00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:18,810
make sure you know it's kind of like an

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,180
app store approval process the obvious

00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:23,099
things are you know you can't call it

00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:26,069
Alexa something you can't any brand

00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:27,540
names and and and they will ask you you

00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:29,310
know if you called it Tesco's or

00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:34,530
something like that or they will ask you

00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:36,750
for to prove the you are Tesco's but but

00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,160
if you pick something quite generic and

00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,290
then you kind of tight so there's

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,089
different types of skills and there are

00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,010
you know there's things around smart

00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:45,839
homes there's media there's a thing

00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:49,230
called flash briefings if anyone's into

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,470
content or into kind of audio production

00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:54,690
and I would if does anyone do anything

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,849
like podcasting or kind of radio or any

00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,069
sound or music type stuff news or

00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:00,300
anything special interests stuff and if

00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:03,210
you know anyone who does there is a

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,710
massive opportunity that there would be

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,140
ahead of the curve to do kind of

00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:10,290
three-minute morning flash briefings of

00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,520
the company level or like your area you

00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,470
know because then what you do is when

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,150
you add them to the device and you and

00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,859
the flash briefings you can hand without

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:20,130
using the app so you can just say

00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:21,300
download the Balmer Football Club flash

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,430
briefing and every morning you would

00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,710
just get one minute intersperse of that

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,690
information along with say your BBC news

00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:31,710
briefing and your weather update et

00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:33,480
cetera so and but then there's the the

00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:36,030
main thing which is the kind of default

00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,700
skill which is obviously what most

00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:41,130
people most people use so you define

00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,750
everything in here and then there's an

00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,730
interaction model but we'll come back to

00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,290
that later and because we tend to not

00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,260
start that way around even though this

00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,579
is how they display it and then you

00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,970
define kind of where your endpoints

00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:57,990
going to live and all you're kind of

00:36:53,970 --> 00:37:00,329
giving it is as a HTTP POST point has to

00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:05,849
be on an SSL has to be a at least kind

00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:08,839
of can't be a self cert and then you can

00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:11,730
you can define regional endpoints and

00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:13,710
you used to have to select kind of US or

00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,450
Europe if you're obviously here versus

00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,210
US because Layton sees obviously

00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,590
important when it comes to audio

00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,870
but now they're changing it because you

00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,950
can have obviously a UK version and you

00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,450
could have a German version and then you

00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,120
can specify different end points based

00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:28,670
on proximity to your users which is

00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,230
which is quite nice if you're building

00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:33,400
something that you were based you there

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:37,250
is the option to give permission to the

00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,410
Amazon account and get more information

00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,870
around you know there's like to-do lists

00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:45,260
there now ability to do custom lists as

00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:46,910
well as kind of address information so

00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:51,190
you can see how it can be used over time

00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,190
for more kind of purchase based behavior

00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:58,370
and then from there we've got a good old

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,010
kind of SSL information and then test

00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,630
now one thing which is quite good on

00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:07,220
this and it's probably something which M

00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:08,900
is worth playing around with first is

00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,180
you can just type stuff in and it will

00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:16,580
tell you you can hear it from Alex's

00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:19,700
voice so I can just say hello and it

00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:23,030
will come out there but what you can do

00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:29,960
is you can paste in this SS ml so you

00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:31,910
can say so you can you can basically

00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,410
start to construct the type of thing

00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:36,740
that you want to output without having

00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:40,310
to build it there is a there is a

00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:43,340
third-party tool come echo Iser I think

00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:45,740
it's called helping rich the URL so you

00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:48,980
can add it to the thing but and that is

00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:51,170
kind of like a virtual Alexa device for

00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,210
you to code against which is which is

00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:55,250
quite good you can then also enter your

00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,570
author instances here and it will tell

00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,610
you the response it gets back so this

00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:01,310
becomes kind of like a mini simulator so

00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:04,790
you haven't gotta keep working to the

00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:06,980
device and that being said it to be

00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:11,420
honest the latency as you'll see in a

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,950
second is is really low what and then

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,670
obviously you go through publishing and

00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:18,890
privacy and all that compliance to just

00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,510
give you an idea from a from how it

00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,580
works point of view is so the moment

00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:23,270
I've got is anyone are you familiar with

00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,730
egg Rock

00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,920
so basically rock so it's tunneling

00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,510
technology so you've run it from the

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,170
command line on your local machine and

00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:34,680
then exposes your local host

00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:36,359
a publicly accessible URL so you can

00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,950
basically hit you can tell this to go to

00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:39,890
the end point and it'll tunnel it so you

00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:42,119
can debug straight to the device and

00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,730
just for the purpose of this is run

00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,859
scope proof which is an API interception

00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,869
tool so basically what we can do is as

00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:51,119
we do the requests we can go to run

00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,500
scope here and we can see the requests

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,540
come through and all the information

00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,680
that we get and then n Grogg will then

00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:00,420
follow that into the local host so what

00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,680
you'll see now is it's going run scope

00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,329
and guac localhost

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,799
so that's gob viously quite an

00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:07,829
aggressive route and you'll see how

00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:10,680
quick that is this is if obviously if it

00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:12,329
was in the you know as your data center

00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,099
which is next to the Amazon data center

00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:18,240
on a fiber connection so obviously the

00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:19,859
speeds are only gonna be quicker so so

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,299
what we're going to do and what I'll do

00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:23,160
is at the end because I don't want to

00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:25,440
upset it I'll walk you through setting

00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,809
up the device because there's a way to

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,299
do it which you don't have to do in your

00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:36,170
phone and will save you so many hours of

00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:41,339
pain if you have a virgin media box so

00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:43,910
what we'll do here is so we built a so

00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:48,900
we have lots of nerf guns in our office

00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:51,380
and after we broke a few light bulbs we

00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,260
thought we need to define some rules so

00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:58,799
we wanted to build kind of like a

00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:00,869
complex game using so you could say

00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:03,119
things like it would basically play

00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:05,430
music and then it you would say I've got

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,200
I've been hit or it would say real

00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,819
different intervals it would say right

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,410
who's got three bullets left and they

00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:12,180
could go and reclaim bullets from around

00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,910
the office because obviously we're

00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,380
growing up so we work a lot and now we

00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,809
thought well let's do something quite

00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:22,230
simple and straightforward and I'll show

00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:24,059
you the example to give you an idea and

00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,010
then obviously how we're going to build

00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:27,630
onto it but just to give you an idea of

00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:30,150
how this works from a code point of view

00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:33,780
and I had a much cleaner solution but

00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:37,710
I'm Web API let me down so I'm going to

00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:40,369
show you a slightly Burrage version so

00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:43,950
there's there's a project on github

00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:45,290
called Alexis skill kit so c-sharp

00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,550
a CP SDK

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:49,230
the we've got a version which will

00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,369
probably publish at some point which is

00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,200
a fork of it but it's got a lot of

00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:54,450
niceties just wrapped around it to make

00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,000
things a bit easier but we'll probably

00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:58,770
open it open source it anyway but but

00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,599
basically what you end up having is you

00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:03,780
have your kind of you know your

00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:05,819
controller endpoint and so this one here

00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,770
basically what they're it so called a

00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:10,530
speech lip is the simplest way point in

00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:12,869
these kind of obviously like a condensed

00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,680
bit of functionality and what we're

00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:15,839
doing is we're just basically

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,280
initializing spiritually and then we're

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,810
going to return this response back

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,369
because what you're doing all you're

00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:22,380
doing is you're intercepting a JSON

00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:24,480
response from Alexa you're working some

00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,130
stuff out and then your spin basically a

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,540
feedback and then that's what the device

00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:32,369
says so to give you an idea so this is

00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:37,190
running a breakpoint everything's

00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:37,190
running so if I said Alexa open no.4

00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:45,420
there was a problem with the requested

00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:53,400
skills response so I'll run the

00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:58,500
application it's like I planned it Alexa

00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:00,000
start nerf war then there's and that's

00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,069
going from run scope all the way back

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,510
through so you know that's pretty quick

00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:09,540
and from this point if we request it's

00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:16,950
guilty to long to respond so what you'll

00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:22,910
see here is this is let me just finish

00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:22,910
it off so that it gives us the response

00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:41,059
so go to the back yeah so so this is

00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:44,059
basically this is what we get from from

00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:48,500
the device you get information about the

00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:49,670
session the context and the request I'll

00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,890
show you another one we get when we get

00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:54,049
some types of information but as you can

00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:57,380
see here there's you know the

00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:58,670
application so you can verify that if

00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,970
you wanted to especially from a

00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:04,220
malicious point of view the session

00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:06,440
identification some you know something

00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:08,299
to identify the user just some

00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,539
information around things are on the

00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:13,880
device like is the audio playing and

00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:16,250
then just some more information from

00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,670
here and then you have the request which

00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:20,690
in essence is there is the bulk of it

00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,210
and even from this point of view you can

00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:25,789
you know even that is quite a useful bit

00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:30,289
of a bit of response for the time out

00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:34,069
now if we run it to completion this time

00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:37,029
so I'll just take this off collector

00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:37,029
start nerve war

00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:46,400
welcome to obvious mouth wall so what

00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:52,460
we'll see now are you ready for me to

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:54,109
pick two players is what we've done here

00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:58,910
is we've got the request through here

00:44:54,109 --> 00:45:00,710
and what is picked up is just a launch

00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:02,059
request so what our launch request is

00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,099
it's that where you said around

00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:06,019
sometimes the sentences at the start at

00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:09,259
the end so that's basically saying we've

00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:11,480
opened the app and what that does is it

00:45:09,259 --> 00:45:13,099
fires into here into this so that the

00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,470
SDK just gives you some kind of nice

00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:17,359
hooks and you just get this kind of

00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:20,029
oniton intent event and a non launch

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:23,029
event and the on launch event and just

00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:24,440
enables you to obviously if you wanted

00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:26,180
to say a welcome message you know

00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,039
whatever it may be one thing that you'll

00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:32,029
find is if you have a skill which people

00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:33,829
start to use a lot and forwards rather

00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,259
than five words makes a big difference

00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:37,819
people start to get really myself

00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:40,609
included you just get really frustrated

00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:42,859
when you know people are just saying

00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:43,490
stuff for the sake of it and when you

00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:44,750
just want to get

00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,150
information especially where it's meant

00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:51,530
to save you time so you find out you go

00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:53,000
on that you might find that you might

00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,430
want to keep optimizing and optimizing

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,520
for more kind of power use as developer

00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:01,520
as a user a comfort kind of grows with

00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,640
it and this speech loop response

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,530
basically what this is doing is it's

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,060
just sending out the XML back to the

00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,250
device and handling all the OAuth stuff

00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:15,140
and that's built into the SDK and that

00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:17,720
Amazon provides it's now from here I can

00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:20,930
now I can now do something with it

00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:23,570
so all we've got in all we've got in

00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:25,550
here is this on intent method and what

00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:28,250
that's doing is it's saying if the

00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:30,980
attend that this one's very basic and if

00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:33,700
the intent is this then then return this

00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:38,900
message if not then just return this and

00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:42,160
the schema for utterances it's as simple

00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:44,660
as this document there's a very pretty

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,360
into an interaction builder which I'll

00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:49,359
show you in a second and but in essence

00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:53,210
what it is doing is it's just generating

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,410
this file and it so where this is good

00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,630
as if you did build something to

00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:59,150
automate this type of generation and

00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,380
it's quite easy obviously just to pop

00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,420
this type of stuff home Ralph with an

00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,880
ammeter upload or manage it through the

00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:07,790
UI and what basically what it's saying

00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,930
is for the setup in 10 these are enough

00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,859
so you can list as many as you want

00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:14,840
these are the phrases that we expect

00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:16,220
people to ask so for example like you

00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:20,180
know this is where you'd have your you

00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:24,609
know things like city or a date for

00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:27,980
example and then and then from this you

00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:30,800
then have this kind of schema which is

00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,780
the different intents so we have a set

00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,790
of intent and then we have the standoff

00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:37,760
which once I play will make a bit more

00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:41,570
sense you have to have a stop help and

00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,520
cancel to publish and that's just cancel

00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,350
obviously will terminate it and help

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,790
gives you you know a nine out of ten

00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:48,770
times you're directing probably someone

00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:52,369
to a web page or you will show a card

00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:55,310
inside the LX app and Amidon say that

00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,630
you should always go voice first so the

00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,849
intent is that they shouldn't have to

00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,190
move

00:47:56,849 --> 00:48:02,489
to another system and if you can kind of

00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:04,440
finish their interaction and then stop

00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:06,660
obviously it's just an end you know it's

00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,099
kind of like cancer but maybe you just

00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,400
don't dismiss the session because they

00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:15,630
might come back to it later time I'll

00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:22,049
give you a an idea of one which just

00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:25,799
maybe I've got our dig I'll dig one out

00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:28,259
and once I've disconnected page to my to

00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:30,420
show you in a minute but basically you

00:48:28,259 --> 00:48:32,819
you define your intent you define your

00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:35,670
utterances and and then you wire it up

00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:38,130
into this into this method here and then

00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:41,160
you it's as simple as you you get access

00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:43,940
to some C sharp strongly typed objects

00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:47,400
and then you do some stuff with it so

00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:53,130
I'll let me run the application and you

00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:55,499
can see what it does so the the now

00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,819
John's here I can blame him so

00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:59,009
originally I was meant to do this talk

00:48:56,819 --> 00:49:01,130
in December so this was going to be a

00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:05,700
lot more prepared than it is today

00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:07,680
so so what the hope was for or it will

00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:11,009
be and maybe it'll be ready for December

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:13,680
and it can be pre December's one which

00:49:11,009 --> 00:49:17,130
is and you can you would be able to text

00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,839
your name to a number which is wired to

00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:21,779
Twilio and that would basically put

00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:23,640
people into a random mirth war situation

00:49:21,779 --> 00:49:26,640
and they would randomly pick two people

00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,680
and then they would have a standoff okay

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,269
so that's the concept of the game and I

00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:34,289
did in London we just did it based on

00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:35,819
row and column row in C column so but I

00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:37,259
forgot no scones today which you know

00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:38,160
makes it very difficult but let me just

00:49:37,259 --> 00:49:44,789
show you how it works

00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:48,479
a lexer start nerve war welcome to

00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:52,739
obvious north of wall and randomly

00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:59,140
select players are you ready for me to

00:49:52,739 --> 00:50:03,400
pick two players yes ten

00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:06,039
9 it doesn't feel right let's build the

00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,799
atman so that so this is select so then

00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:10,450
so this is an example so basically what

00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:13,809
happened there is it jump to the second

00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:17,739
in 10 so there's too intense within the

00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:20,349
application so what we're going to do is

00:50:17,739 --> 00:50:24,400
we're going to fix it so if I go into

00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:33,970
here and we look at the interaction

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:36,999
model what you can see is if I want to

00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:39,489
assign the if I want to run the player

00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:41,730
selection process I can select what I

00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:44,980
can mention one of these three phrases

00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:46,809
if I want to initiate the kind of

00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,220
standoff once the two players were down

00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:51,970
on the stage then I would say these two

00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:54,309
phrases but it's it's it's not what's

00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:56,410
happening because of the the prototype

00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:59,200
is it's not it's not picking up it's not

00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:01,900
making yes please a correlation to the

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,910
set up so maybe it's too generic maybe

00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,989
it's you know something else is

00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,910
conflicting with it because and other

00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:10,779
intent has got it so we kind of need to

00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:12,819
make it a bit more kind of obvious so it

00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:19,539
knows so instead of saying yes please

00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:21,609
let's go with it makes no sense

00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:24,069
obviously but for the purpose of this it

00:51:21,609 --> 00:51:26,019
all they're provers who is write them

00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:29,970
and what you can do there is now you can

00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:32,789
you literally just press save model and

00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:36,539
that's been deployed to the device so

00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,539
Alexa open therefore

00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:45,609
welcome to of his mouth war select

00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:49,980
randomly are you ready for me to pick

00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:52,910
two players dev Southcoast

00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:54,160
let's do both

00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,590
[Music]

00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:03,389
there's no breakfast toys

00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:03,389
[Music]

00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:10,960
I have selected third row five from the

00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:13,690
left and second row two from the right

00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:18,280
please come down to play can't offer you

00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:20,710
one give them a round of applause so so

00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,810
so what's happening there is so

00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:24,850
basically it's as you can see it's five

00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:27,420
trying to find that the sentence that it

00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:32,080
can relate to and then all this doing is

00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:35,080
dropping into dropping into this end

00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,580
point dropping into the speech lip and

00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,710
then from the speech that it's finding

00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,450
the intent and trying to match it

00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:42,040
closest to that based on the iterance

00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,540
--is that's come in so that's where it's

00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,370
important that you find them and in this

00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:47,020
case it's obviously default into the set

00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,010
of one obviously if you were going to do

00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,240
this in where we've done one to

00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:51,130
production you would drop it into our

00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,290
you sure do you want ask something else

00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:55,960
you try and give people a way to kind of

00:52:53,290 --> 00:53:00,820
get back to where they are and then when

00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:03,460
we go into the into the setup you can

00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:05,950
see in here all we're doing is kind of

00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,600
monitoring the stage data state so what

00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,430
happens is in the session you have

00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,720
attributes and the attributes you can

00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:13,060
get the values from and you can also

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,070
push values to and they persist as you

00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:18,370
go through and what happens as you go

00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:19,870
through this you send back a flag to say

00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:22,150
if that's the end of the session or not

00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:23,410
so if you ask someone one thing you can

00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,700
send back a flag saying that's all I

00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:27,730
want to know and it will just turn the

00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:29,350
lights off if not then the light stays

00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:31,210
on and is waiting for another bit of

00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:34,060
prompt you're you're only allowed to

00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:35,560
send back a maximum it's advised it's

00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,750
less than eight seconds but you can send

00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,400
back a maximum of 90 seconds before he

00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,420
gets caught off especially where it

00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,800
comes to audio if you're going to do

00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,180
anything more than that then you

00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:47,860
probably want to look more into a media

00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:49,600
stream type thing now from here as you

00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:51,640
can see we've kind of in this example

00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,830
all we're doing each time it gets an

00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,540
input we're just increment in a value

00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:58,290
just to go from stage one to stage two

00:53:55,540 --> 00:54:01,180
and of you know very like that you know

00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:04,870
block 1 block 2 block 3 quite kind of

00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:06,640
basic but as you can see here this is

00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:09,370
that this is the the output that we're

00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,660
sending back and it is quite straight

00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:12,790
forward so we're saying let's do this

00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:14,770
and there's a there's there's some kind

00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:16,300
of you can give a little twang to some

00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,650
of the words to some of the letters you

00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:20,119
can whisper

00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:22,250
they've got some things that amazon have

00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:25,220
created which just are a bit more bold

00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:27,710
which are not a part of the SML kind of

00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:29,300
specification but what you can do is

00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:32,300
then you can intersperse it with an

00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:34,730
audio tag and just give it a URL and the

00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:39,260
mp3s have to be specially especially

00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:41,090
encoded bit rate which you can you can

00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,980
output from anything like audition quite

00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:46,670
straightforward there are awesome you

00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:50,720
can do it from them what

00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:52,520
what's the audio like ffmpeg type thing

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,990
and you can you can go and let the

00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,240
command line of it and they give you the

00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:58,550
code for it to spit it out but it's

00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,609
mainly just optimized for speed but then

00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:04,330
you can drop back into text and then if

00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:06,170
you wanted to drop back into audio so

00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:08,690
actually and then obviously on this one

00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:11,900
we just end the session the next stage

00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:19,150
then becomes things like so Alexa start

00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:25,480
office no for Alexis start no for

00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:28,160
welcome to office nor for war begin

00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,950
please stand back to back and take three

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,960
steps forward when I start counting I am

00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:39,680
gonna count down from ten Bernie draw

00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:42,950
got it got it let's do this so there we

00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,420
go three so there we gets look again so

00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:46,970
therefore we have to go into the model

00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:48,830
and this is this is a lot of what the

00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,119
actual work is it's not the code in the

00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:52,130
coding is all pretty straightforward is

00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:55,550
getting that model right and learning

00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:58,520
the thing that that is going to fire it

00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:00,920
so here the actual interaction is start

00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,900
the draw so that's the thing I need to

00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,859
say so what you'll find is if people use

00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,240
it you'll find the things that they

00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:06,619
actually are going to say and then you

00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,960
would add these austell rinses in as

00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:10,670
they go and as you learn and learn what

00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:15,530
people are going to do so

00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:20,780
Alexis d'Arnaud for welcome to office

00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:22,400
north wall begin please stand

00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:25,130
back-to-back and take three steps

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,490
forward when I start counting I'm gonna

00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:35,210
count back from 10 then you draw got it

00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:35,960
stop the draw let's do this that's

00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:42,860
illicitly

00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:55,190
this is the this is the fun so let's go

00:56:42,860 --> 00:57:00,890
with got it okay Alexa open no.4 welcome

00:56:55,190 --> 00:57:02,480
to office north wall begin please stand

00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:05,210
back-to-back and take three steps

00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:08,020
forward when I start counting I'm gonna

00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:19,700
count back from 10 then you draw got it

00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:25,970
got it let's do this so what we'll do

00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:28,460
now is let's debug it so from here we'll

00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:35,230
grab this in ten Alexa start and

00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:39,710
therefore welcome to office more for war

00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:42,650
begin so there we go we've got our first

00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:44,660
one in please stand back-to-back and

00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:47,150
take three steps forward when I start

00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:52,000
counting I'm gonna count back from 10

00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:52,000
then you draw got it got it

00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:59,319
see in here the intent is coming through

00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:01,660
is still defining a set up so this is

00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:03,970
again this is where you have to kind of

00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:07,180
really request its guilty too long to

00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:08,920
respond so you kind of gotta go back in

00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:11,979
and go right what is it what what is it

00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:15,549
thinking it's getting and then as you go

00:58:11,979 --> 00:58:23,380
through it's really just kind of honing

00:58:15,549 --> 00:58:29,799
in these sentences so it's never

00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:31,630
normally this part Alexis no for there

00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:42,220
was a problem with the requested skills

00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:48,190
respond run it Alexis no for welcome to

00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:49,809
office never wall begin please stand

00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:52,539
back-to-back and take three steps

00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:55,529
forward when I start counting I'm gonna

00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:58,319
count back from 10 then you drop got it

00:58:55,529 --> 00:59:04,119
begin

00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:07,380
ten nine it doesn't feel right let's

00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:07,380
build the atmosphere a bit

00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:19,480
eight seven six five it will continue on

00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:23,050
as you can imagine the standoff will

00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:28,870
happen and so the the thing as you can

00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:34,750
see the thing with it is get ready for

00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:39,460
it cool and then people find F guns and

00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:41,140
everyone has fun but the again it just

00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,580
it just cements to the importance of the

00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,570
language bit because that's the bit that

00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,980
is obviously the bit that gets

00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:46,270
four-string in and if it gets

00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,550
frustrating for you as developers it's

00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:55,000
gonna get frustrating as a user so it's

00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:57,040
really optimizing that the the thing

00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,200
from from the point of view of then

00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,670
having this information what you can see

00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,320
is you can start to see the requests

01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:04,870
that come through and then you can start

01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:07,090
to kind of optimize based on how things

01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:10,050
are interacting obviously you can then

01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:12,760
look at that request if you intercept it

01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:15,820
even in kind of a beta set you can now

01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:19,090
run it to a kind of a beta beta

01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:21,730
environment where you can where you can

01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:23,680
test it to a small group of users and

01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:25,120
which you couldn't do before and then

01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,560
you'd have to keep it in there if you

01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,480
wanted to keep it private and you didn't

01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,820
want to publish it but an amazon are

01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,010
really driving forward and the ability

01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,450
to generate money people are getting

01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:37,840
paid it's not a lot and especially

01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:39,460
things around game health you know the

01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,280
top applications to give you an idea are

01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:46,600
music meditation and gaming at the

01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:49,750
moment so we're kind of at that point in

01:00:46,600 --> 01:01:00,400
its kind of development and so if we go

01:00:49,750 --> 01:01:08,170
to setup is right do not be offended it

01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:10,300
will be worth it and hopefully they

01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:19,500
haven't changed the rules and this will

01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:19,500
let me down Alexa start nerf war

01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:29,760
welcome to office never war randomly

01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:32,400
select players are you ready for me to

01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,340
pick to play so basically it will beep

01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:38,880
swear words and then I think it finds

01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:40,890
offensive you can obviously go you can't

01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,290
obviously around that spice by saying

01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:44,850
letters differently but you know it kind

01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:46,590
of shows Amazon's intent through it as a

01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:48,180
product that it's kind of really is

01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:50,400
going for privacy focused especially

01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:52,440
around children and family environments

01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,150
and so you just got to kind of be aware

01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,640
of them types of things if you're

01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:58,950
interested in like rich said if you you

01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:02,820
know I'm getting punched in the face in

01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:04,140
a few weeks for charity but linked to

01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:06,120
that I've been kind of trying to

01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:08,640
automate my life and outsource or

01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,960
automate anything and I'm bid document

01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,610
it so if you're interested in that kind

01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,730
of life hack stuff then check it out

01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:13,730
there
