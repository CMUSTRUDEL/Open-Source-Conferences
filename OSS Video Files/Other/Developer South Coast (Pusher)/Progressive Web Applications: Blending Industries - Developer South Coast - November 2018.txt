	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
today I'm going to be talking to you

00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,640
about progressive web applications and

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:09,469
how I'm a cinch they're essentially

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,700
challenging to industries and how the

00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:14,460
software development industry is kind of

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,920
segmenting into sub segments and how we

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,770
can sort of stop that happening and have

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,449
one sort of code base that adheres to

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:26,340
different devices so I'll just go into

00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:28,769
obligatory slide who is this guy I'm

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,830
Jack Pritchard I'm a freelance for an

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:34,200
end web developer I kind of touch on the

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,840
back end a bit but I'm predominantly

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,600
front-end development you can tweet me

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,090
abuse about how bad my slides are what

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,460
Jack is made or you know if you feel

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,050
like posting a picture you can feel free

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,960
to do that too

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,090
I'm a I'm a student at Southern

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,640
University I'm doing my masters in

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,260
creative enterprise and I studied

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,840
website design and development in my

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,030
undergraduate degree and a lot of my

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,890
undergraduate course was focused on

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,899
progressive web apps especially my final

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:10,200
major project which I'll be discussing

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:12,780
in the slides later on so as I mentioned

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,659
earlier about blending industries this

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,920
presentation aims to sort of blend and

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,460
merge and connect these different

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,229
industries and how there are native

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,130
mobile applications and on my web online

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,509
websites responsive websites and why

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,189
there's no need to sort of separate

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,900
everything to different solutions we

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,680
should sort of focus on building one

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:40,920
unified solution which can perform as

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:43,460
well as any other solution would so the

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,360
aims of this presentation is to inspire

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,020
developers and I'm no expert on this

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,090
topic

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,610
I've develop my own progressive web app

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,829
I'm very familiar with the technologies

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,439
used in a progressive web app I can talk

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,290
about how I've done it and how you can

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,790
be inspired from it but if you want to

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,079
learn anything in detail especially

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,570
about some of the technologies such as

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,340
service workers I won't be covering any

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,390
of that in great detail but I'll be

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,979
covering the basics they sort of

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,950
introduce you and lead you on to

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,390
learning

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:18,280
about it so before we begin I want to

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:23,590
first define the industries that I'm

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:26,590
challenging or trying to blend so our

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:30,910
first industry is on my websites browser

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:33,489
applications so I kind of even see this

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:37,480
is Web Apps which is sort of more tools

00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:42,069
that people use online booking services

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,019
or online to do to-do list apps and

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:46,330
whatnot and then also a brochure you

00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,730
know websites they usually consist of

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,549
front-end web technologies such as HTML

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,069
CSS and JavaScript and back-end systems

00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:58,140
or server-side languages such as PHP and

00:02:54,069 --> 00:03:01,180
dotnet and then the second industry is

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,209
iOS Android and other native mobile

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:08,410
applications so as far as I'm aware

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:12,610
Android is developed with Java and iOS

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:15,640
is developed of Swift and this

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,980
separation of code bases means that if

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,160
you want to put out a web app which

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,200
works in the browser and on iOS and on

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,510
Android you find a lot of companies are

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,700
splitting hairs in creating native

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,760
applications for Android and iOS as well

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,549
as their website when the majority of

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,650
applications are built for businesses

00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,569
aren't really needed you've got a

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,450
website which does the majority of the

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:41,440
functionality yeah those are the two

00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,440
industries that I'm going to be

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,090
challenging so we've got our industries

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,680
browser applications based mobile on

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:53,500
native applications I've got a question

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,739
I haven't I've done this talk once

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,819
before and I kind of answered just went

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,060
straight into answering the question

00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:03,959
myself but if anybody volunteers aren't

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:09,549
sure why do mobile applications exist

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:11,200
and he just start that is a great point

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:15,329
yeah Apple does like to take that big

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,979
slice look at exactly it's offline use

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,150
yeah if you ever went on London

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:23,680
Underground you can't connect to

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:25,190
anything so yeah so as mentioned mobile

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,410
applications solved a lot of the problem

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,570
and create reliable solutions for

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,630
creating applications where we could

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,360
store data and files offline can be used

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,830
without an internet connection and as

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,900
you touched on the inputs that you can

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,510
get from a device you want to be

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:45,020
accessing data motion-sensing maybe or

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:50,870
video feed from the camera or the

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:52,640
microphone so those were essentially

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,610
solving new problems with old solutions

00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,730
that by creating native mobile

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,820
applications the first successful smart

00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,290
phone the iPhone or the most popular

00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,770
smartphone to have been created at the

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:10,130
time was into 2007 I was like more than

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:13,360
a decade ago and the web browser has

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:16,510
come a long way in those 11 years

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,440
challenging the need for any mobile

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,680
application when you can just build a

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:26,840
web browser application so what can we

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,820
do with the web in 2018 touching on the

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,050
inputs from devices you can now

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,720
potentially access camera microphone

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:39,770
orientation tilt and GPS and I'll demo a

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,360
couple of those now so with a simple

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,550
piece of JavaScript I'm getting a feed

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,970
from my laptop which is accessing my

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:50,570
webcam this has to be done over HTTPS

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,570
for security reasons and you are

00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,370
prompted in the browser to enable a

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,850
webcam will disable it I'm sure a lot of

00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,320
you have probably experienced this so

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,020
it's nothing new it's just it's cool

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,910
that you're able to access that with one

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:09,410
line of JavaScript which is requesting

00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:14,300
access to that media and then microphone

00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:16,310
so these are audio waves but I'm picking

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,410
up and visualizing you can do a lot with

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,350
the data that you're getting from your

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:25,460
devices this is just a very crude basic

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:28,580
demo but just to help visualize how I'm

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,070
getting data from my device without the

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,220
need for any frameworks or libraries

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:38,010
it's it's all built into the browser

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:42,120
this device orientation this was a demo

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,740
from the Mozilla developer Network it's

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,660
just easier to show you'd and get out my

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,600
phone and try and show everybody what's

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,940
going on and you can actually you can

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,690
access this information even in some

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:58,320
laptop devices and tablets so you know

00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:02,130
the browser has a lot more access to the

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,800
inputs that our hardware has nowadays

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,850
that wasn't there before you'd even need

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,380
a library or some sort of workaround and

00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:15,750
nowadays you can just pick it straight

00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:18,060
out the box so couple of inputs that

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,850
we've got recovered I didn't cover GPS

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,770
cuz that's kind of hard to show off in a

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,510
demo I could try and emulate it and

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,900
trick the browser into thinking and

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,360
moving around but I'll cover GPS later

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:35,790
on when I talk a bit more about creating

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:40,470
a progressive web app so we've got our

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:43,770
inputs but that's no use if we don't

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,660
have any storage offline there's no

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,210
point in having an input if there's no

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:53,420
output and that theater is going nowhere

00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:57,990
if we can't use a file to access it so

00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:01,350
the primary offline I guess storage for

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,840
files to what we have is service workers

00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,860
and service workers essentially act as a

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,420
proxy between your browser and the web

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,470
any requests that you make of the

00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:15,660
network using your browser will first go

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,030
through the service worker and then grab

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,520
the new file and then back it up for

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:25,530
offline use it's essentially client-side

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:28,740
caching so yeah so if you go to a

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,330
website once if you dictated it in your

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,000
code that the service worker should

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,830
cache the image directory and your

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,630
website then when you connect to that

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,599
web page it will backup all the images

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,849
in the image directory and then if you

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,770
have internet connection it will look

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,540
for new images but if you don't have any

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,810
internet connection it will use the

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,170
backed up images with no internet

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,170
connection

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,040
this is kind of a better diagram to

00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:00,830
visually explain what I'm referring to

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,200
so yeah again your app connects to the

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,630
service worker and then requests the

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,550
files if you're online you get the new

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,240
files if you're offline you get the

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:14,330
files that were most recently accessed

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,790
and again with service workers because

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:20,120
it's essentially client-side caching you

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:23,450
can bust the cache the same way you bust

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:28,400
a server cache you can have versioning

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:31,010
and avoid a cache when you want to send

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,260
a ton of new files to your users there

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,460
are actually a ton of different

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,220
processes you can use this is just one

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,920
method of using a serviceworker but

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,800
there are ways of using more strict

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,350
service workers which force you to use

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,810
offline files but that's not the best

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,580
solution it's much better to check for

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:54,470
new files every time that you're

00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:57,500
connecting to a webpage or frequently so

00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:01,670
we've got files they're accessible

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:06,800
offline images HTML files JavaScript and

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:09,290
CSS you've got your data inputs but the

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,640
the last piece of the puzzle really lies

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:17,330
in bit of storage so when I was doing my

00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,930
dissertation and I did check recently to

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:23,390
this index DB is the best API that you

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,820
can use in browser in terms of the most

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:28,940
support you have across the board in

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,770
modern browsers to store data that you

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,680
could be accessing in the browser for

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:36,850
offline consumption so the example that

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,920
I kind of gave my first did to talk was

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:42,170
say you were on Airbnb and you were

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,380
looking at places to go and stay you

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,750
have the the wrapper or the shell of the

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,760
application which is the HTML Javascript

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,160
and CSS but the bear is all the

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,900
information about the actual locations

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,050
and how much they cost and when they're

00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:00,730
available using index DB you can store

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:02,740
all this in a browser within the

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,970
you can store this in a database within

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:16,870
the browser so the best way to show this

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:20,949
off is if I inspect my slides so I

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:23,350
created a test database which is part of

00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:26,260
my slide deck and we've got this

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,240
database with a table PWA benefits we've

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,430
got a key Jack Pritchard which is the

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,399
name or the unique identifier and then

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:37,899
we've got an object which is our value

00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:40,630
and that contains some subfields I'll

00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:44,560
show you later on how I used this method

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:48,639
to store geo Jason which is a

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,230
geolocation format for Jason it's fairly

00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,260
similar to standard Jason it's just got

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,420
geometry points barbies showing you how

00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,620
I did that with a larger application

00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,620
than just a test database

00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,709
so the current state of the web I

00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:10,419
believe we're entering an exciting time

00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:13,509
for the World Wide Web

00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:16,659
we have inputs from devices that weren't

00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:18,849
available to us before we have the power

00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:21,970
to store files offline store data

00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:24,699
offline this wasn't possible when the

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:29,889
iPhone first came about we we were

00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:31,599
forced to create a new sort of category

00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:35,199
of software development where we're

00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:36,489
building for native devices because we

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,749
didn't have access to all these tools

00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:45,039
that we have today and because that sort

00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:48,489
of industry is so invested in it's kind

00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:51,309
of hard to take a step back and look at

00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:53,979
alternative solutions but hopefully this

00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:57,729
talk will help inspire you to somewhat

00:12:53,979 --> 00:13:00,039
think about that and because we have all

00:12:57,729 --> 00:13:01,720
of these tools and technologies there's

00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:05,639
a new term that's come about which is

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,829
PWA or progressive web application

00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,239
progressive web applications best

00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,599
described as if you can imagine a

00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:15,789
website that works offline and online it

00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:20,739
can be accessed anywhere in the world in

00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:22,809
browser as if it was a native app so the

00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:24,639
main benefits of using a progressive web

00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:27,069
app which I'll go into a bit more detail

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,039
in a bit about how they work and

00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:33,149
building one is that they provide an

00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:33,149
experience that people are very

00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,949
accustomed to there's it's very much

00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:42,849
like an in-app experience that you would

00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:45,209
get with a native application on iOS or

00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:45,209
Android

00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:49,659
they let they leverage the technologies

00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:53,259
we've covered embracing the concept of

00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:57,129
storing offline and yeah they're

00:13:53,259 --> 00:14:00,239
accessible so this was a great quote I

00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:03,189
found from ionic framework in their blog

00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:05,289
they said that a progressive web app

00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:07,089
it's a web app that uses modern web

00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:11,049
capabilities to deliver an app like

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:14,619
experience to users which when I show

00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:17,740
you a couple of demos in a second you'll

00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:19,480
see it looks like an app because like

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,520
seumas aren't lee and it's a difference

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,770
between them besides the installation

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:30,010
process the Tim PWA was coined by Google

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:32,710
it soon horizon popularity and more

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,530
recent browser updates as seeing an

00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,480
embrace of technologies that are like

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,360
essential for you to be building a

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,340
progressive web app originally was just

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,050
google chrome but now we're seeing edge

00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:48,160
is now supporting some of technologies

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:50,410
and Firefox and Safari and the rest is

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,080
sort of following suit you won't get any

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,330
support from internet explorer obviously

00:14:53,080 --> 00:15:01,960
it's not auto updating and nothing seems

00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:05,350
to work on Internet Explorer so I guess

00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:08,020
this is last year I was working at a

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,200
company called moved to they've

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:15,070
specialized in video games and mobile

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:18,820
app development and I was working as a

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:21,190
web developer and myself or the senior

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,030
web developer at the company like the

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:27,940
head developer had seen on Twitter that

00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:30,910
Google were offering team training in

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,910
progressive web applications and at the

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:37,200
time all I knew was HTML and CSS and a

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:40,570
little bit of PHP and no JavaScript and

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,540
the head developer knew thought he'd

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,630
been working for ten years so he knew so

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:49,240
much more than me but we both went along

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,980
to the training day Google essentially

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,200
pioneered progressive web applications

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,760
so we just want to hear what it was

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,950
about from the creator's themselves the

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,400
senior developer learned a lot more than

00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,360
I did

00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:06,640
I just got introduced to the concepts

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,330
but it was very exciting having the idea

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,000
of adhering to different industries with

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,710
one code base because you're essentially

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,290
reducing the amount of workload needed

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,880
and I'll go into some of the benefits of

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,280
using a progressive web app over a

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:26,290
native application in the next few

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:28,330
slides so the main takeaways that I got

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,860
from going to Google where that

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,030
progressive web applications aren't a

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,580
new trend

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,920
but not a trend at all there are new

00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,540
concept that's building on existing

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,830
technologies that are now coming into

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,820
the browser for all of us to use

00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:45,790
capturing information and presenting

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:49,650
it's similar to how native mobile

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:52,240
applications do and any website

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,710
literally any website in the world can

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,610
benefit from PWA technologies because

00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,340
even if you're not going to build a

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,050
website which works as an app offline

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,600
there's no website in the world which

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:09,280
doesn't benefit from being able to cache

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:11,790
files offline or access their offline

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,160
this this is not just beneficial to

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,690
improving the speed of websites but also

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,660
reducing the amount of data consumption

00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,090
for our users it's kind of a no-brainer

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,800
so even if you don't adopt all of the

00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,870
fundamental concepts you need for a

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,310
progressive web app there is definitely

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,690
at least one or two that you can pick

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:35,560
out and use in any of the websites

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:39,100
you're using in the future so I'll show

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:43,540
you some progressive web apps so George

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:45,660
Oh George calm I'm not too familiar on

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:50,380
who owns George I think it's as does

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:54,280
clothing brand or yeah so this is a

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:58,210
progressive web app it has a very

00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:01,120
familiar design I instantly recognize it

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,480
as either a native mobile application or

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,160
a responsive website the only thing that

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,690
I would say that's different from a

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,970
responsive website is that there's no

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:14,170
browser bar which I'll go into in a bit

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:18,040
and so you've kind of got like a shell

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:20,110
wrapper which if you have no access of

00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,910
data you can still show the sort of

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,860
structure of what the application is

00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:27,340
going to look like before you input data

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,320
and then once the bit is loaded it looks

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,680
exactly how it would any native

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,840
application or responsive website so

00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,550
that's all well and good for developers

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,350
but it makes no difference to businesses

00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:44,380
but it actually does make difference to

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,950
businesses because this was a case study

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,700
post

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:52,030
on Google developers progressive web app

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:55,300
sort of archive and they listed some

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:58,080
statistics which were kind of enticing

00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:01,570
even if you're not a big business person

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:05,140
you get in three point eight times

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,300
faster average page load time decreasing

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,300
bounce rate increasing conversion rate

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:13,900
more page views and people were on the

00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:16,390
app for longer so if you went to any one

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:23,170
who has the decision-making power in

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:25,480
your company or or in in your in an

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,360
agency then if you show them these kind

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,710
of statistics it kind of helps

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,780
illustrate the whole point of

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:35,470
progressive web apps in terms of

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:37,450
business talk I guess also to developers

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,660
in terms of Pedro time and whatnot if

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,750
you're passionate about that so that's

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,940
just one case study another case study

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,490
that I found this week when I was doing

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,640
some more research into progressive Web

00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:54,700
Apps trying to beef up my slides a bit

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,110
was Starbucks so the Starbucks team or

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,770
developer team we're working on a

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,480
progressive web app last year I've

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,920
actually had a look at the application

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,160
before button nose and progressive web

00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:11,680
app and there were some statistics that

00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:15,880
were released in the last year so the

00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:21,040
Starbucks app on iOS is 146 megabytes

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:24,610
but the progressive web app is 600

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:28,060
kilobytes so it's not point four percent

00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:32,800
the size it's less than one over 200

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:34,270
fully free the size and you don't have

00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,250
to go for the installation and boot up

00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,800
process progressive web apps like

00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,540
lightning fast as soon as you added

00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,890
added it to your home screen it's

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,860
installing in the background you don't

00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,810
have to watch the boss slowly go up

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,500
especially if you've got 146 megabytes

00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:51,370
to download

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,850
unfortunately I'm pretty sure the

00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:57,049
Starbucks progressive web app is only

00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:00,080
usable in America at the

00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,970
but there are other progressive web app

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,480
examples that you can have a look at

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,450
today

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,120
these include Twitter light I don't know

00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,830
if any of you use to it but the Twitter

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,450
progressive web app is it's so much

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:16,880
quicker than the actual Twitter app

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:18,530
Instagram has a progressive web app I'll

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,929
show you a webpage at the end of the

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,640
slides which kind of gives you a

00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,559
showcase of a ton of progressive web

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:31,100
apps you can go and install on your

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:34,610
phone and experiment with today so I'm

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:37,010
gonna move on to showing you how I made

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,539
my own progressive web app and kind of

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:42,400
go through all of the details about

00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:45,470
creating a progressive web app this

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,610
project is kind of outdated now it was

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:52,159
built whose bill about half a year to a

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:56,480
year ago which just shows how quick the

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,710
web's moving if it's outdated so I will

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,630
show you a demo of it but I'm pretty

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:04,070
sure most of sites falling apart now I

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:07,070
don't actually oversee the project at

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:09,950
all anymore I've passed it on to the

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:12,650
co-creator he's the business guy and I

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:15,890
was developing it but it got out of hand

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:18,559
to the point where one developer work on

00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:22,970
the project wasn't enough and I couldn't

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:27,010
maintain it but that's another story so

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:30,620
this is a video which kind of shows you

00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:32,450
how I access the web site in the browser

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,520
how I've installed it as a progressive

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:39,049
web app and then have access to

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,760
progressive web app on my phone at the

00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:45,169
bottom we've got ad expelled to home

00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,240
screen the foot is not responsive but so

00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:50,900
when you click Add to Home screen you're

00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,059
going to prompt click OK back down a bit

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,850
back to the home screen scroll down it

00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:59,179
hasn't been installed just yet it gave a

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,770
quick refresh and then expelled once you

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:04,370
click on it you get a splash screen with

00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:06,049
a brown color and logo and then one key

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,210
important thing to notice here is that

00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:09,320
there's no browser bar and that's not

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,770
because I've cropped the video or

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,800
anything

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:15,590
that's because in the technologies that

00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,560
I'm using I've specified that I want

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:23,540
this to be a full screen video full

00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:27,500
screen application and not a Windows

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:35,780
application or in the browser how we do

00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:37,850
the time okay okay cool so before we

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,600
dive into creating a progressive web

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:44,900
application there's a list of

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,160
specifications that required to be

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,880
considered as a progressive about

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,990
forgets a progressive web application

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,540
you need to register a serviceworker

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,430
which I'll cover briefly what a

00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,580
serviceworker is and how you install one

00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:02,510
it needs to respond to 201 offline which

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,040
is the status code for okay contains

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,450
some content when Java scripts are not

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:09,080
available so your whole application

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:11,780
can't just be a plot Jass and writing a

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,950
ton of Dom elements it has to have some

00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:17,870
sort of fallback uses HTTP this is kind

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,330
of a new like a no-brainer if your

00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:25,120
website isn't on HTTP I would highly

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:29,330
recommend doing some research into that

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,760
redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS because

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,380
as this is being installed on your

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,510
device and it's caching files offline

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,520
you want to ensure that you know your

00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,680
Security's up and all the files that are

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:44,060
being stored offline aren't full of

00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:46,280
malware and malicious the user can be

00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,230
prompted to install a web app so as I

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,330
showed you in the video when I accessed

00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,160
the web site I was prompted to add it to

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,150
the home screen and then once I clicked

00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,150
on Add to Home screen

00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:59,900
you're then given a second prompt we can

00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:02,030
cancel or add configured for a custom

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:05,920
splash screen which you saw when they're

00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:08,480
cooked into the app from my app drawer

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,870
address bar which uses the same color

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:15,110
power as the branding for expelled and

00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:18,140
then has a meta tag which is essentially

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:20,750
to stop websites needing to be pinched

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:23,070
and zoomed it Auto scales it just as any

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,900
responsive website would do

00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,480
again content is so it's correctly

00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,730
that's kind of piggybacking off this

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,670
point but if you've got any overflowing

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:35,370
content in your responsive website then

00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:37,230
it's gonna look a bit messy and it's not

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:40,559
doesn't warrant as a progressive web app

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:44,309
and then finally web application on

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:47,760
Android home screen so that last point

00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:50,100
is kind of a bit outdated because you

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,240
can install it on iOS now as well but

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:59,280
that was the specification at the time

00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:02,790
and I don't know if I cool so how are we

00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,100
analyzing the project Google Chrome's

00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:07,740
hosted numerous developer tools one of

00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:11,760
them is auditing your web pages so you

00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:14,280
can audit for SEO performance and one of

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:20,100
them is auditing for progressive web

00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:24,390
apps so I'll show you the tools so this

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,770
is my personal website and I've run an

00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:29,640
audit I'll show you how I went about

00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:31,320
that in a second where when you run an

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,760
audit you're given sort of like a

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,440
checklist where it tells you what you've

00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,210
done right and what you've done wrong as

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,940
well it's information as to how you can

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:42,470
amend the things you've done wrong to

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:49,110
access this you simply right click

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:53,809
inspect go over the audits tab and then

00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:56,429
you can select the press of webapp order

00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:59,490
okay it won't let me run one because

00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:00,660
I've got it open another tab so that's

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,900
one way of doing it within the browser

00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,520
but I also found out this week when I

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,429
was browsing the web for performance

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:13,140
tools that Google developers have

00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:15,929
released a beat a website called web dev

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:20,299
and you can input your URL for your

00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:23,490
website and then run run run and order

00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:26,179
the same way you would in the developer

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:28,140
tools so you can see I've got

00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:31,520
performance accessibility best practices

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:35,090
at SEO so you can kind of run that

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,090
could've sworn it had

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,040
coulda sworn I had PWA stuff because I

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:44,080
was getting well you can do it within

00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,000
the browser and analyze how your website

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,290
is doing which is essentially what I did

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,420
along my project so at the start of my

00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:54,430
dissertation you have to list out a list

00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,040
of requirements and specifications and

00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,600
what you hope to achieve and how you're

00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,970
going to measure that and this is how we

00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,610
measure it we essentially say if we can

00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,470
take off every single point then we've

00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,930
got progressive web app if we can't meet

00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,670
all the requirements then it's not

00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,460
really a progressive web app there are

00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:14,770
varying levels of degrees to what

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:17,620
constitutes a progressive web app I'd

00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:19,360
say if your user isn't prompted to add

00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:25,120
it to the home screen it's not a

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:29,040
progressive web app cool so the first

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:32,050
point is registering a service worker

00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,330
service workers they act as a cache I've

00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,860
kind of already gone over kind of

00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:38,860
briefly what a service worker is and how

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:41,680
it works they're enabled through

00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,610
JavaScript and will cache the files that

00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:48,010
you list in the Service Worker file the

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,900
Service Worker file itself needs to be

00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,620
in the root directory of your website or

00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:55,120
at least it did when I was building this

00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,780
and you can get around this by using a

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,570
symlink

00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:03,700
on your server or any other tricky ways

00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:06,760
but so the Service Worker itself is a

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,650
JavaScript file which you dictate or the

00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,260
rules and the cache name and the cache

00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:13,390
version and what files you want to be

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,190
downloading and storing for offline but

00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,960
that doesn't register the serviceworker

00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,130
in your browser you have to add in a

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,310
little bit of JavaScript for that as

00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,310
well

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,960
so that's not great contrast I'll try

00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,550
and read it out loud for anyone who

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,120
can't read that because that's quite

00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,650
hard to read actually if serviceworker

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,030
in navigator so we're essentially saying

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,760
is serviceworker

00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,710
available in the browser then add an

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,410
event listener to load so in the web

00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:44,170
page loads then we are registering a

00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:46,180
serviceworker with this absolute URL to

00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,380
my serviceworker javascript file and

00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:53,390
then once complete

00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:55,400
using a promise we will then run the

00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:58,130
console.log and say you've successfully

00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:03,760
registered this or if not then what

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:10,010
errors did we get when registering and

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:12,110
so when I access the website I'm given

00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:16,880
the Consul message that the Service

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:19,100
Worker registration was successful one

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,590
note to mention which is kind of a

00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:25,100
biggie for most full-stack developers or

00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:27,530
especially back-end developers service

00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:31,640
workers that they're storing files

00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:34,340
offline so it's essentially storing your

00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,470
HTML CSS JavaScript and images if you've

00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:40,010
got anything that runs server-side it's

00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,299
kind of it hard to if not kind of

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,830
impossible to be captioned that with a

00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:46,640
serviceworker or at least to my

00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:50,750
knowledge so a lot of its gonna be

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,429
focusing on static assets one tool I'm

00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,400
using at the moment which is perfect for

00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:58,340
kind of giving me serviceworker and

00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:01,190
progressive web app capabilities while

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:03,530
still having a full stack solution is

00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:08,210
something called Gatsby which is a

00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:11,750
static site generator for react so this

00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,940
website well if you have a website which

00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,820
is built on something like WordPress

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:19,400
which is on PHP then you can use the

00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:22,970
REST API and import it to Gatsby and

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:25,250
then generate HTML files and so when

00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,710
you're storing HTML and CSS and

00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:31,400
JavaScript you can actually store every

00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:33,080
single page that the user accesses it's

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,850
a lot more difficult when you're trying

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:40,850
to cash assets for an actual vanilla

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:44,179
WordPress install because you only be

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:46,720
able to sort of cache the images CSS and

00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:46,720
JavaScript

00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:57,100
so point two is responsive 201 offline

00:31:53,230 --> 00:32:01,299
so for anyone who doesn't know HTTP

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:05,830
codes or I'm pretty sure 200 is okay so

00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:07,720
when the status is successful and that's

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,690
normally done by providing a full back

00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:14,740
offline so you might have offline dot

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:17,590
HTML and so when somebody goes on to

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,880
your website and request something if

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,280
they've already got access to the

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,770
serviceworker then the service we can

00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,230
return HTML file which says oh you're

00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:29,440
offline and you don't have access to

00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:35,860
this otherwise suicide rendered pages

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:37,720
and so you've got a fallback so when I

00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,780
access the website offline

00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,400
I was given an offline hang on a tick

00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:46,570
and it was just sort of cached

00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:48,850
information and data about the website

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,760
I'd accessed if I added any new spots I

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:55,120
wouldn't get that data pulled through

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:59,799
and I still need to show an index DB of

00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,750
that but I'll come back to that contains

00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:05,470
some content where javascript is not

00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:09,549
available as I touched on earlier if

00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:13,169
you're using you know and rendering a

00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:16,000
ton of Dom elements to the page then

00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:17,350
it's not it's not going to warrant as a

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,570
progressive web app a progressive web

00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:21,610
app in the name itself is progressive

00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,830
it's it's kind of the same as

00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:26,169
progressive enhancement you're providing

00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:28,659
a fallback for the user and if you're

00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:30,580
relying on jobs JavaScript being enabled

00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:34,080
then you're excluding anyone who doesn't

00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:36,130
have JavaScript enabled on their site

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,110
which kind of seems counterintuitive

00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:42,630
seeing as you're using a service worker

00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:42,630
but that's just one of the rules

00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:52,340
so when you access the expelled website

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:56,750
offline you the CSS with a loading icon

00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:58,630
and the general layout so when Java

00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:02,890
scripts available I used to Google map

00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:06,290
API and that will generate the home page

00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:08,119
I kind of should have explained what

00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,859
expelled was before getting this far and

00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:14,770
I just realized I won't explain what

00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:17,899
exporters expelled skate is essentially

00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:19,669
it's a it's a skateboarding website

00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:22,669
where it's your look it's where you are

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:24,770
and shows the skate spots around you so

00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:26,899
if you're a skateboarder and you went up

00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,280
to Bristol for the day when you get to

00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:30,200
Bristol you open up the app and it'll

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,030
show you all the skate spots around you

00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,450
show you content surrounding that it's

00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,310
kind of like a social media application

00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:39,440
you can kind of see where the project

00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,060
started get me dreaming too big and real

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,109
I think I can't handle all this on my

00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,710
own

00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:50,450
oh yeah I was essentially using a REST

00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:52,669
API and yeah it worked for the final

00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,440
major project growing it to an actual

00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:55,840
product needs more time

00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,400
[Music]

00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,280
anyway it's back to building a

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,560
progressive web app so the website

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:11,090
itself is stored on digital ocean using

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:14,330
using a VPS on ubuntu 16.04 uses apache

00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:18,170
for you know routing and I generated an

00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:21,050
ssl certificate using let's encrypt

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,820
which i not sure if anyone's familiar

00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:26,030
with it's a great tool for generating

00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:29,710
yourself an ssl certificate

00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:32,720
instead of paying for one it's the same

00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:35,960
the same quality as a paid one so

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:40,010
there's no disadvantage but generating

00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,480
yourself one and using one for free if I

00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:47,090
pay for one every time I built a website

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:49,910
I'd be out of pocket and yeah so it's

00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:56,850
using HTTPS as should most websites

00:35:49,910 --> 00:36:01,410
nowadays again really bad contrast but

00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:05,820
so I'm basically using Apache to convert

00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:08,940
any HTTP requests to HTTPS so if I'm

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,430
using a plug-in or a framework or using

00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:15,210
an external resource I want to make sure

00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:18,240
that it's HTTPS so even if I know I've

00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,290
made a HTTP request to my code I don't

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,920
want that to be carried out

00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:24,480
unless it's HTTPS so converts it because

00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,020
- not if it doesn't work it doesn't work

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:31,200
but that's on me to check if the

00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,950
requests are working or not but if

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,980
you're going to be building a

00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:37,230
progressive web app just as just as if

00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,840
you were installing any native mobile

00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:43,920
application you want that to be safe and

00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:46,710
this doesn't have the same vetting

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,260
process that mobile application would

00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:52,410
have you normally have Apple or the

00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,420
Google Play Store which would do quality

00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:57,000
control and make sure that the app isn't

00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:00,540
malicious it meets a set of requirements

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,790
that's why Google have put together a

00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,860
list of specification requirements you

00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:12,390
need to meet because that is essentially

00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:13,830
their vetting process so the user can be

00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,800
prompted to install the web app as you

00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:20,030
saw when I accessed the web site at the

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,400
bottom you had Add to Home screen and

00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:26,280
the minimum requirement for prompting a

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,170
user used to be having a man web

00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,240
manifest file which I'll show you an

00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:38,220
example of in a second I'm pretty sure

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:41,520
real favicon generator yeah they give

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,900
you a manifest file by default anyway so

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,270
if you're using a tool like that you're

00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:49,710
probably given a web manifest file I'm

00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:53,360
not sure what their requirements are

00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:55,740
nowadays to prompt the user because I

00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:59,430
feel like you have to have certain

00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:03,420
images at certain dimensions for it to

00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:06,120
be usable because my personal website is

00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:10,180
using a web manifest file but because

00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:13,930
the images aren't 512 by 512 and

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:15,400
nine two by one line two it's not wanted

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,500
it's a progressive web app it has to be

00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,860
sitting dimensions because you don't

00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:31,150
know what device is installing the

00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:34,450
application an example so this is the

00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:37,990
expelled scape web sites web manifest

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:41,410
file and I'll kind of go for all of the

00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:43,480
properties now because the next three or

00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:48,040
four slides is essentially me referring

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,650
to these properties name is the title of

00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,990
the application pretty self-explanatory

00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:53,860
short name needs to be under twelve

00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,410
characters long

00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,960
so expelled it's kind of what me my mate

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,910
were calling it so exiled skateboarding

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,110
is the full-fledged name short name for

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,270
when you have it installed on the app

00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:07,810
and what you see on the home screen or

00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:12,570
the app drawer is expelled and then

00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:15,640
we've got this sort of array of icons

00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:19,180
one nine two three eight four five

00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:23,980
twelve and also the types as I said real

00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:26,140
five favicon generator bill if you

00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,510
import an image they'll give you all

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:32,350
these cropped sizes as well as generate

00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:36,460
this manifest file for you background

00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:39,700
color and theme color background color

00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,650
is the color that's shown when you're in

00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,220
the browser so you might know it's that

00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,510
when you're going to certain websites in

00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,370
Google Chrome on your mobile device or

00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,950
even other browsers on your mobile

00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:53,050
device the browser bar would be a

00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,670
different color it could be red blue it

00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,450
could be chronically whatever you know

00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:59,650
whatever you want that's specified with

00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:02,110
background color and then theme color

00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:05,760
I'm pretty sure is used of the splash

00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:08,800
screen so when you click on the app

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,500
you'll have the image you've specified

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,510
on top of the color background and

00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,510
that's what the fume color is and then

00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:19,210
display it's what I was referring to

00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:21,700
earlier when I said that when you access

00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,740
the application it's not got a browser

00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:27,030
tab it's it's

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:30,100
as if it's any other mobile application

00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,390
if you opened up Google Maps you don't

00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,400
have a browser tab because it's an

00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:39,280
application and that is essential to be

00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,290
giving a familiar experience huai users

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,820
because that's essentially the breaking

00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,070
point wherever I'm not progressive web

00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:47,860
apps are going to work is will uses a

00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:49,840
top lip because if users don't adopt it

00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,670
then it's never going to work we can you

00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,930
know try and force them to use it it's

00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:59,590
just never going to pick up start URL so

00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,880
this is the web directory that the

00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:05,050
application goes to when you click on

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,330
the icon orientation so if your website

00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:09,850
works landscape and portrait you can use

00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:12,040
any but if it only works on landscape or

00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:23,800
portrait you can specify and then

00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:28,780
finally language which is English which

00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:32,380
was a bit more trimmed but the lines

00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:35,260
that really health so this is for my

00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:37,150
website I've got a Gatsby plugin which

00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:41,680
is essentially generating a web manifest

00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:44,700
file from like a JavaScript file I have

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,200
where I'm just inputting data to use and

00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,330
I've had to manually crop these logos

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,810
but you can use a tool like a real

00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:55,300
favicon generator again and I've you

00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:57,369
know again just input the information

00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,320
and the web manifest file uses that in

00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:01,000
various different ways it's not just

00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:05,230
progressive web apps that web manifest

00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,180
files use there are like the browser as

00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:10,720
I said earlier changing color that's

00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:13,780
from the web manifest file so yeah I

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,280
feel like that even having that file is

00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,859
beneficial because it's not just full

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,450
progressive web apps so these next few

00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:21,790
slides again they kind of touch on what

00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:24,700
I've just covered you can set icons at

00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:26,230
different sizes in different web

00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,790
manifest files you might be setting them

00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:30,100
at different sizes but for progressive

00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:35,170
web apps you at minimum need one line

00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:37,420
two four eight four five one two bad

00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:39,250
contrast

00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,020
so actually you don't really even need

00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,960
to read that that's kind of just going

00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,400
over how I've listed out the custom

00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,609
images that are being used for the

00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,349
splash screen and I didn't really have

00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:52,119
enough room on this slide to explain

00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:54,790
which is why I kind of went and showed

00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:59,230
you an example file anyways the

00:42:54,790 --> 00:43:03,849
background color and be like on taken

00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:07,150
from the web manifest file again

00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:09,849
background color a theme color this is

00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:12,970
simply taken as a hexadecimal value from

00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:18,400
whatever brand you're working with every

00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:20,470
brand has a primary color so this is a

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,890
meta tag which goes in the head of your

00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:27,280
document most websites or modern

00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:28,780
websites nowadays have this meta tag you

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,430
just want to double check on your

00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,740
website if you're considering turning it

00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:36,250
into a progressive web app that you have

00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:38,140
this meta value set and again just to

00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:40,690
explain what it does is it stops the

00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:43,089
need to pinch and zoom but also I think

00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:46,869
it might take away the capabilities to

00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:49,299
pinch and zoom if you wanted to where

00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:50,920
it'll just Auto resize to the view that

00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:54,670
you've designed the responsive website

00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:57,549
for this isn't for anyone who's advanced

00:43:54,670 --> 00:44:03,880
this isn't a trip up but definitely for

00:43:57,549 --> 00:44:07,059
beginners again content is sized

00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,089
correctly for the viewport so expell'd

00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:13,059
was built mobile first the photo and the

00:44:10,089 --> 00:44:17,740
video wasn't mobile first but I was kind

00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:21,010
of beta mode images and videos they

00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:22,599
resize and there's no over spells so if

00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,670
you have any overflow on the website

00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,990
then it's not only going to look bad

00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:30,849
because people can scroll horizontally

00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:36,059
when I'm into they also just won't allow

00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:36,059
you to Warren as a progressive web app

00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:45,300
a web application on Android home screen

00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:49,890
so I kind of touched on this a bit

00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:51,420
earlier but the main points away from

00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:54,390
this slide is that it's creating a

00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,070
smooth transition froth from native

00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:59,660
mobile applications super aggressive web

00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:01,770
apps because users aren't gonna

00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:05,040
necessarily care about the benefits of

00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:08,000
progressive web apps until they start

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,910
using it and see that it's a lot quicker

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:16,260
but you need to create that transition

00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:18,360
and that's kind of a teething point

00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,500
which is why progressive web apps are

00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:23,010
kind of I wouldn't say they're having

00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,900
difficulties with but I feel like there

00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:26,940
are different routes that progressive

00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,120
web apps need to go down for it to be an

00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,440
easier transition at the moment if you

00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,750
go to a website and it's prompting you

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,070
to install I don't know what most

00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:38,340
consumers are gonna do when they're

00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:41,610
prompted to install those who do do see

00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:44,760
benefits and I would install it if it's

00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:46,410
a website that you use often but it kind

00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,470
of just seems a bit I wouldn't call it

00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:54,720
spammy but kind of an uninvited

00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:57,240
notification but having it were when you

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,580
do click Add to Home screen it adds it

00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,460
you know to your home screen it kind of

00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:04,050
blends what a mobile application and

00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,030
what progressive about web application

00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:08,640
is and the user won't know any

00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:13,470
difference once it's installed so yeah

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:15,960
so basically we built a PWA so I'm

00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,920
pretty sure their requirements is going

00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,080
to change in the future

00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,370
I don't feel like it's gonna get there's

00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:23,220
not gonna be a lot more change but I

00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:25,940
feel like there's gonna be fine-tuning

00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:28,620
over the next several years

00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:31,380
but according to the specification at

00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:33,660
the time the PWA was complete I met all

00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,930
the requirements when I ran my order it

00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:39,990
gave a take on every single point and

00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:42,480
therefore my project was a success and I

00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:44,790
graduated my course I mean I woulda

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,870
graduated if I failed it's just easier

00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:51,069
if it goes right so just a recap this is

00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:54,029
all the topic so I've kind of

00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:59,170
when creating the progressive web app

00:46:54,029 --> 00:47:02,440
and yeah just just when you do build

00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:04,599
your own or if you do be sure just to

00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,999
use lighthouse lighthouse is the best

00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:09,459
tool to be analyzing your page it comes

00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:12,880
straight from the developers who have

00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:15,190
you know built this concept and it's

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,920
great for keeping track of what you need

00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:19,779
to do to improve to become better create

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,489
a better progressive web app and even

00:47:19,779 --> 00:47:22,989
gives you links to resources where

00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:25,920
you're going wrong and kind of gives you

00:47:22,989 --> 00:47:25,920
tips on how you can do it better

00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:35,109
so our pwace compatible in browser there

00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:38,499
was this funny website put up which is

00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:41,739
is serviceworker ready and well i was

00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:45,789
doing my dissertation it said no and

00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:48,249
it's he said no for a long time but it's

00:47:45,789 --> 00:47:51,430
now saying yes and essentially it was

00:47:48,249 --> 00:47:55,660
checking across what browsers supported

00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:59,859
the core technologies that are needed

00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:03,880
for a serviceworker to you know work so

00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:04,959
samson internet was quite quick to see

00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:10,089
you know I'm pretty sure it was Chrome

00:48:04,959 --> 00:48:13,690
and then we might mean Firefox and then

00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:18,459
edge Safari and opera came along later

00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:20,619
so promises debugging if it's in the

00:48:18,459 --> 00:48:26,259
browser if you can raise your own

00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:29,499
register and yeah that's all that

00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:32,859
background sync this only Chrome at the

00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:35,140
moment looks of things but you know I'm

00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:37,890
sure we'll all catch up eventually but

00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,890
yeah

00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:46,630
these is I think it's a mix it's a mix

00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:48,010
of both because I will touch on some of

00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:51,970
the cool stuff as hunting with desktop

00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:56,670
browsers but yeah actually I have a can

00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:59,079
I use link as well this doesn't cover

00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:04,510
service workers but this covers another

00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:07,030
one which is the web manifest files so

00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:09,970
the web manifest file are touching

00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:11,950
service workers in a moment as you can

00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:15,069
see on the left side we've got all of

00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:17,440
this red and that's kind of alarming but

00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:19,510
the majority of desktop browsers aren't

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,630
using the manifest file it's mainly

00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:24,940
mobile browsers so fortunately the

00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:27,609
majority of mobile web browsers or

00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,770
modern ones support it weirdly enough I

00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:32,950
eat us and split I didn't even know

00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:35,079
IE mobile was the thing and then

00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:37,030
blackberry and Android Browser don't

00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:39,099
split and Opera Mini Opera Mini is kind

00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:41,859
of a difficult one because it doesn't

00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:46,299
necessarily support a lot of features

00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:48,099
nowadays yep so service workers as you

00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:50,559
can see it's supported by the majority

00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:52,299
of browsers nowadays Internet Explorer

00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,660
you not gonna get any support on Opera

00:49:52,299 --> 00:49:57,130
Mini again no support but then the

00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,559
majority of mobile browsers you're

00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:01,119
getting a lot more support again similar

00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:05,470
to well it's more support than the web

00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:07,539
manifest file so touching back on the

00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:10,630
point that I made earlier on your

00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:12,309
website benefits from using progressive

00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,990
web app technologies even if it's not a

00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,450
progressive web app implementing a web

00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:19,359
manifest file brings you no harm

00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:22,270
takes you 30 seconds to do and creates a

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,890
better user experience or more in brand

00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,559
experience if you want to change brain

00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:29,589
colors for the browser or implement

00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,210
logos and it's great for if you're

00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:32,500
installing an application to a device

00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:37,270
even if you're just adding it to home

00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:38,680
screen and then service workers I've

00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:40,000
kind of gone over the whole benefit of

00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,630
service workers you're essentially

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,730
client client-side caching and it's not

00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:47,490
just mobile devices its desktop devices

00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:50,079
too in desktop browsers the

00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:51,670
cross-compatible nurse of the

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,100
technologies that progressive web apps

00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:56,500
you

00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:58,510
specifically in modern browsers but I'm

00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:03,370
gonna touch on the new support that

00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:05,440
Apple gave so since iOS 11.3 Apple now

00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:08,140
supports service workers and progressive

00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,210
web applications I don't have an iOS

00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,550
device so I can't tell you from

00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:15,160
firsthand experience that they work just

00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:17,110
the same as I enjoyed if anyone has iOS

00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,930
they can have a look at some of the

00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:21,940
applications that I show at the end and

00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:25,360
see how they fare on that operating

00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:27,790
system the update increases the scope of

00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,380
potential users of your progressive web

00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,750
applications or any web applications

00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,910
that can take benefit from the

00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:38,290
technologies ships workers manifest

00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:40,000
files as I can I touched on and we had a

00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:44,170
discussion about how Apple doesn't want

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,230
to give away their big profits it was

00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:49,510
kind of a big change to see iOS take it

00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:52,720
on board because now that iOS and

00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:54,670
Android support it there's some fewer

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,340
restrictions on how many people can take

00:51:54,670 --> 00:52:00,520
benefit from it

00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:05,740
and Microsoft have actually got some

00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:07,450
cool guess that's image Microsoft have

00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:12,580
also taken benefit off progressive web

00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:15,640
apps the Microsoft Store I don't know if

00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:18,190
anyone actually uses it that much but if

00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,690
you have a Windows 8 or above machine

00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:22,150
I'm pretty sure you can access the

00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:25,810
Windows Store and install applications

00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:27,340
straight to your desktop so a

00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:31,600
progressive web apps are now being

00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:32,740
listed on the Microsoft Store Microsoft

00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,320
are kind of taking on board that

00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:37,600
progressive web apps aren't just for

00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,670
mobile devices and seeing as the

00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:43,270
Microsoft phone didn't fare well they

00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:45,850
stick in the desktop and I think this is

00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:50,350
going to be something that it's quite a

00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:52,270
big game-changer because it it's kind of

00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:54,490
taking it's kind of trying to blend

00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,840
another industry which I'm not going to

00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:58,300
try and challenge because I feel like

00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,250
software development is still important

00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,230
across all devices I'm just sort of

00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,310
questioning whether we need to have as

00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:06,130
much investment in

00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:08,680
and mobile software development but if

00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:10,930
desktop computers can start to install

00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,630
applications which are progressive web

00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:15,760
applications then you're starting to

00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:17,860
remove even more barriers of what

00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,220
operating system are you on what browser

00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:24,610
you on depends on what applications you

00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:26,140
can install because that is the number

00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:28,480
one most beautiful thing about the world

00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,760
wide web is that it's accessible to

00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,930
anyone with an internet connection and a

00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:36,400
device which can connect to it so it's

00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:39,100
been removing barriers in terms of

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,310
people accessing content and information

00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:44,350
online but now we're seeing a shift to

00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:47,650
it doesn't matter what device you're on

00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:49,180
you can use this application gone are

00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:51,850
the days where you needed to install

00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:54,130
Microsoft Word you can now use Google

00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:56,860
Docs and you know which ones better is

00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:58,840
up to personal preference or what you're

00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:02,110
using it for but the fact that we're

00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:04,570
getting these app like experiences in

00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:07,630
the browser and not having to install

00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:09,250
software is a beautiful thing I think

00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:11,200
that it's definitely where the worldwide

00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:14,560
web is going we've had a responsive web

00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,690
design and we've had shifts in how our

00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,250
websites are used and now we're getting

00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:20,140
even more powerful tools and frameworks

00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:22,270
where we can build applications and not

00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:25,120
just sites we're building tools that our

00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:29,170
users can complete tasks with it'd be

00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:34,270
great to see restrictions removed

00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:37,840
everywhere so this is a pretty cool

00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:40,110
website that Google showed me and the

00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:44,110
senior developer and we went and visited

00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:47,650
it's called PWA rocks and it's a

00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:50,830
directory of progressive web apps and it

00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:53,140
doesn't list some of the more notable

00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:55,960
case studies that google developers have

00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:59,200
listed on their own website but it does

00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:02,230
show off some of the more fun I guess

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,630
you could say or micro apps that kind of

00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:08,620
take benefit from progressive web app

00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:11,070
technologies you might notice some of

00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:15,160
them SVG OMG

00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:17,140
Financial Times website it's just flappy

00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:20,890
birds my favorite one

00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:22,930
is wiki offline when I first started

00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:26,049
talking about progressive web apps to my

00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:29,170
lecturers and peers at university a lot

00:55:26,049 --> 00:55:32,200
of them didn't seem to grasp the concept

00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:33,970
of progressive web apps or I don't know

00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,650
I guess talking about progressive web

00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:38,710
apps is one thing but being able to show

00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:41,019
it visually and functionally it's a

00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:43,059
completely different thing so what I did

00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:46,450
was I went through a couple of the PWA

00:55:43,059 --> 00:55:49,390
rocks archive case studies or projects

00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:52,690
and found that wiki offline proved the

00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:54,869
best one I don't use it on desktop I

00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:57,099
mainly use it on mobile but you can

00:55:54,869 --> 00:55:58,930
install it on your mobile device and

00:55:57,099 --> 00:56:01,630
essentially what you can do is you can

00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:02,829
search for a Wikipedia article and then

00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:05,049
when you access the Wikipedia article

00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:07,930
you can click on it's kinda like a

00:56:05,049 --> 00:56:09,760
slider and it allows you to save the

00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,619
article for offline use and then what

00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,250
I'd do is I would go offline on my

00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:17,470
device show my peers I'm going around

00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,990
the application as if there's no

00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:21,460
barriers I've got no internet connection

00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,869
but I can still access the article that

00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,660
I originally access with the internet

00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:27,579
connection and that is basically

00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:30,250
breaking it down to its basic concept is

00:56:27,579 --> 00:56:31,869
accessing information offline in a

00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:34,559
container which uses the files that

00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:38,349
we've backed up using the serviceworker

00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,539
yeah so if you do have a little play

00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:42,339
around and see what progressive web apps

00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:44,079
there are highly recommend this so it's

00:56:42,339 --> 00:56:45,640
great to just see two different

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:49,210
variations of how the technologies are

00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:54,430
being used pokedex is a fun little one

00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:56,740
it's just stores information from JSON

00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:58,990
API about Pokemon and you can install

00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:04,390
that information offline similar to the

00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:07,059
wiki offline so I'm gonna be uploading

00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:11,200
these slides on my website probably

00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:12,460
tomorrow so if you do want to click on

00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,529
any of the links you can do so tomorrow

00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:17,940
or if you want to take a screenshot you

00:57:14,529 --> 00:57:20,740
can type these in any browser later on

00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:23,500
but as I kind of mentioned at the start

00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:25,539
this talk wasn't to give you a tutorial

00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,730
on how you can build a progressive web

00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:30,160
app I'm not an expert on progressive web

00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:33,550
apps if anything I'm kind of

00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,630
I I know more than you could say people

00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:37,120
who don't know about progressive web

00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,470
apps and I built my own and I understand

00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,680
how to analyze and see the

00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:45,160
specifications but I'm not the industry

00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:48,010
leaders and you know these links will

00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:51,160
take you to fear the resources Jeremy

00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:53,140
Keith a great book called going offline

00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,240
where he basically documents how you can

00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:57,010
build service workers if I try to teach

00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,720
you how to build a service worker it'd

00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,750
be terrible I'd be basically

00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:05,530
regurgitating Jeremy keeps information

00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:07,270
and he does it in a way where the ideas

00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:10,300
and principles he shows can be applied

00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:15,940
to any web application not just your

00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:18,220
case study or your case PWA stats this

00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,290
is a crazy website where it shows you

00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:23,170
some of the case studies I kind of

00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:25,330
touched on earlier where George calm saw

00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:29,070
a great increase in traffic and user

00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:32,080
retention and conversions PWA stats has

00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:33,840
sort of little cards which show you how

00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,520
different businesses all over the world

00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:39,460
are benefiting from progressive web apps

00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,180
so if you are trying to speak to the

00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,890
powers-that-be

00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,330
who dictate whether or not you're

00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:45,580
building progressive web apps and it's

00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:48,270
something you're passionate about then I

00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:50,590
definitely check out PWA stats grab some

00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:53,440
statistics that you can show your boss

00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:56,830
and he or she will go WOW like this why

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,800
are we not doing this google case

00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:02,080
studies is the number one resource to go

00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,150
to if you're looking for some of the

00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,580
bigger brands or applications that have

00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:09,250
benefited from using progressive

00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:14,350
progressive web applications and then

00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:16,870
henrik Jordan announced that he had a

00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:19,300
great blog post which kind of covered

00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:20,890
the Starbucks progressive web app he I'm

00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:23,470
pretty sure he worked on the Starbucks

00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:26,080
progressive web app and he talks in his

00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:28,840
blog post about why he was betting on

00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,970
the web from the start because he saw

00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,950
that there were there was a like a

00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:35,590
divide here a choice when you sign in

00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:38,350
software development to either become a

00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:41,110
web developer or become a native

00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:42,970
application developer and I'm another

00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:50,500
thing too I'll go on to and I'm not

00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:52,510
to slander or like the face the idea of

00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:54,820
creating native applications there's

00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:58,510
definitely a place for but he thought

00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:59,770
that the world wide web is the beauty of

00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:02,170
it is kind of what I was touching on

00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:04,510
earlier where it's void of needing to be

01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:06,760
on a specific operating system it can be

01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:09,670
used anywhere in the world people were

01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:13,240
developing blank very applications when

01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:14,890
blackberry was a thing and like we died

01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:17,530
out and as developers invested all that

01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:20,290
time into learning something which

01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:22,570
eventually became outdated and not used

01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:25,600
at all whereas if you're learning for

01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:28,390
the web I feel for like at least the

01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:31,000
next 10 or 20 years the web as we know

01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:33,460
it is gonna keep growing whether or not

01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,600
user interfaces start to disappear and

01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,490
whatnot it's another thing but

01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:40,090
definitely the functionality is always

01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:43,840
going to be there and then finally at

01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:46,420
the bottom there's a react PWA tutorial

01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,130
if anyone's using react if you're using

01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,930
something like Gatsby like I mentioned

01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:51,100
several times throughout the talk you

01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:53,890
can get a plug-in which will help you

01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:56,260
build a progressive web app but it's

01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:58,660
fairly straightforward if you follow

01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,870
along with the tutorial I showed you how

01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:03,790
I built mine but you know as with any

01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,990
web technologies it's forever changing

01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:10,090
and it's going to change the next few

01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:13,140
months so where should you be using

01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:15,130
progressive web apps as I mentioned

01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:17,920
progressive web apps beneficial to the

01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:19,960
majority of websites no user is going to

01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,130
suffer from cached files unless files

01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,170
are constantly changing on the website

01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,550
or if they get stuck with an old cached

01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:27,840
version of the website that they

01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:27,840
shouldn't you using anymore

01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:35,920
and as I touched on you can avoid the

01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:38,830
cache and serve up new files when not to

01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:42,100
use progressive web apps so coming back

01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:45,310
on where I said native applications have

01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:47,350
a place large applications such as

01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:49,480
mobile video games existing client

01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:52,180
projects where it will require a

01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:55,390
significant amount of live refactoring

01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:55,559
and with clients who don't share beyond

01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:59,880
the

01:01:55,559 --> 01:02:02,449
of the benefits some other use cases for

01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:06,359
not building a progressive web app is

01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:09,059
silverside technologies almost

01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:11,579
impossible to be storing offline sits

01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:13,319
service light it's not client-side so if

01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:17,039
you've got a large application

01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:19,920
which is based suicide then you're gonna

01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:24,299
have a very big challenge ahead of you

01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:26,819
and a lot of refactoring and yeah

01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:28,949
essentially so progressive web apps

01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:32,849
aren't always appropriate so a bonus

01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:36,029
slide before we get to the end I was

01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:40,579
talking I did this whole presentation at

01:02:36,029 --> 01:02:43,469
sew-on University for the BCS and

01:02:40,579 --> 01:02:46,019
somebody in the crowd was like I'm

01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:48,059
building these if we wanted to build a

01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:50,999
progressive web app but we didn't want

01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:52,890
it to look like a web site we want into

01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:55,259
it to look like an Android or an iOS

01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:57,089
native application what options are

01:02:55,259 --> 01:02:59,430
there is there a library we can use and

01:02:57,089 --> 01:03:00,689
I was like I have no idea and then

01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,920
somebody else in the crowd share it out

01:03:00,689 --> 01:03:07,519
and they're like yeah you can use

01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:11,579
framework seven so this is essentially

01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:14,039
CSS and JavaScript framework where you

01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:17,999
can build front-end user interfaces so

01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:20,609
this is iOS and Android and then you can

01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:23,400
go into different I guess design

01:03:20,609 --> 01:03:26,699
patterns that you'd normally get dialog

01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:30,089
box so you could basically import this

01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:32,579
to the the project you're working on

01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:35,519
whether it's new or existing if you're

01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:37,549
making it go from iOS to progressive web

01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:40,679
app but you want it to look like iOS

01:03:37,549 --> 01:03:42,150
depending on what device accesses your

01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:44,039
website I'm pretty sure you can load

01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:47,069
different styles so if they're on iOS

01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:52,199
iOS interface this Android Android

01:03:47,069 --> 01:03:54,779
interface and it looks very interesting

01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:57,119
I'm not used it myself but from what I

01:03:54,779 --> 01:03:58,949
can see it brings it on a benefit so you

01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:02,759
can use it with view and reacts you can

01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:06,719
you can do payment methods built-in

01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:09,630
monetization so yeah you could

01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:12,180
essentially skin it like an Android

01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:16,590
or iOS application if that's what your

01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:20,400
client once and it wouldn't take too

01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:26,820
much difficulty to do um yeah let's just

01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:27,720
burn a slider I guess so conclusion yeah

01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:30,510
hopefully I've given you some food

01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,700
before I again I'm no expert but

01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:34,020
hopefully I've given you sort of insight

01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,330
as to the technologies that are being

01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:38,010
used and maybe it's something that you

01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:39,530
can now go forward and explore a bit

01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:43,200
more hopefully it's piqued your interest

01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:44,580
because any website can benefit from the

01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,960
technologies you use it's not just

01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:50,760
progressive web apps I've haven't given

01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,040
you a tutorial a written tutorial or

01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:56,280
visual tutorial on building one I've

01:04:53,040 --> 01:05:03,660
just shown you how I've done it and what

01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:08,730
was necessary to build one in 2018 so

01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:11,430
yeah with the web moving I feel like the

01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:12,930
biggest web shift was responsive website

01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,640
design in recent years

01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:17,550
I feel like progressive web apps could

01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:21,630
definitely be what is the next shift for

01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:25,770
the web again it comes back to will

01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:29,960
customers adopter and consumers but even

01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:34,500
if they don't adopt everyone benefits I

01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:38,310
did have one idea which one of the

01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:39,990
articles also touches on so he probably

01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:41,430
had the original idea but I came out a

01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:44,190
bit as well

01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:46,800
is that progressive web apps have this

01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:48,510
really big barrier ahead of them we've

01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,570
seen Google introduced there are an

01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:53,670
operating system recently with I think

01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:55,230
it's the chrome notebook or is it a

01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:59,550
Chromebook what I'm not sure what it's

01:05:55,230 --> 01:06:01,440
called but you you can't install the

01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:03,540
same like applications you would on a

01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,340
Windows or iOS device it's very

01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:07,590
restrictive you can have Google Docs and

01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:09,780
whatnot and apparently there's been

01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:11,460
quite a lot of resistance to people

01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:15,090
taking that on board because it's quite

01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:17,180
limiting and this is all comes from a

01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:19,470
question that was asked at the last talk

01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:22,110
but I feel like that resistance comes

01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:22,660
because you have no option if you have a

01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:24,910
Chrome

01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:27,010
you're told you can only install these

01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,960
kind of apps whereas with progressive

01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:32,020
web apps it's just an option it's not

01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,520
enforced it's oh you're using the

01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:36,130
website do you want to use progressive

01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:40,780
web app no you don't have to it's just

01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:42,310
an added benefit and the number one

01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:45,820
thing that I could see which would

01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:49,270
totally bring in progressive web apps to

01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:51,580
every single user in the world or those

01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:53,620
who install apps is being able to

01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,790
include the option to install a

01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:56,650
progressive web app or a native

01:06:54,790 --> 01:07:00,220
application from within the Google Play

01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:04,060
Store or the iOS or Apple wouldn't do

01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:06,880
that but but it'd be great imagine going

01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:08,770
to the Google Play Store and having even

01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,360
just the option to install a progressive

01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:14,080
web app or not to introduce these

01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:16,060
concepts to consumers because if I have

01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:18,610
the option to install an app which was a

01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:20,550
hundred megabytes or 500 kilobytes I

01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:22,600
know which one I'd be choosing

01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:24,760
especially if it offers the exact same

01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,920
functionality it's really annoying

01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,060
because as I touched on like the web is

01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,490
a beautiful thing because it's

01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:32,740
accessible to anyone and we've seen it

01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:35,140
grow immensely because of the

01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:37,390
incentivization of companies making

01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:39,040
money like this in a real world that's

01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:43,030
how things grow as if money is invested

01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:45,790
but it's painful to see that Apple are

01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:47,920
being so reluctant and it seems like

01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:50,560
such a cash grab where they're stopping

01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,510
the web progressing because of monetary

01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,800
reasons like we don't that's not what

01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:58,540
the web is about it's never what has

01:07:53,800 --> 01:08:03,180
been about they are tangent yeah for

01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:03,180
businesses yeah yeah yeah

01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,750
