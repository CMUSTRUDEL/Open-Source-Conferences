Title: Functional C# - Developer South Coast - May 2018
Publication date: 2018-05-22
Playlist: Developer South Coast
Description: 
	Main Session

Functional programming has been one of the major trends in software development over the last few years. Most of the more useful/important new features of C# in the last few versions have been ported from or inspired by features in F# (e.g. Generics, LINQ and Tuples). This session will look how you can utilise core functional techniques like immutable types and pure functions along with a number of functional features added to the C# language over the last couple of versions to produce code that is easier to reason about and less likely to contain bugs.
