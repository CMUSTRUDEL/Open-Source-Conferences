Description: 
	No-one writes software without getting stuck from time to time. Whether it's an API not working as expected, an algorithm not producing the right results, or a vexing exception, it's a rare day when coding is just plain sailing. So what do you do when you hit a problem? In this talk I'll walk through some strategies and techniques so that you can:

Narrow down where a problem occurs Reproduce the problem in a debug-friendly environment Write a log as you go, to avoid going down blind alleys multiple times Capture your problem concisely but precisely, to ask colleagues for help, report a bug or post on Stack Overflow While there are no true silver bullets in computing, the ability to work on solving problems in a methodical way is as close as I've found.
