so I make bike frames basically what i

00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:16,660
do is i take steel tubing and cut it

00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,849
together to specs of whatever custom

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,989
bike and building for whoever's come to

00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:26,140
me and braise this particular bike is

00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:30,189
phillip braised it's not welding I'm

00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,630
just kind of diving into TIG welding and

00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,910
then there's the bike that I brought

00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:38,800
last time was logged which is kind of a

00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:40,990
soldering last time was I guess

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,030
basically on the brink of me to where I

00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,740
am now in January I quit my day job

00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,380
which was at the LA County Bicycle

00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,870
Coalition which is a great nonprofit in

00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,200
Los Angeles if you are into bikes and

00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,910
need resources they do everything from

00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,350
putting bike lanes on the ground making

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,790
sure bike lanes get on the ground to

00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,130
making sure that people are taken care

00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,170
of when they've been in accidents and or

00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,180
ignored by the cops or city or whatever

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,689
has happened because la is notorious for

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,890
such so i left i left my day job didn't

00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:15,340
really know exactly what i was going to

00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:20,049
do was thinking about leaving Los

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,880
Angeles anyway so i left my house of six

00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,979
years that we had built a warehouse and

00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,439
workspace into left boyfriend left job

00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:28,450
and left Los Angeles so I am currently

00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,159
in some sort of strange transitional

00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,380
world where I'm living with my parents

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,979
which is awesome because my parents are

00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:39,159
great in Las Vegas of all hellish places

00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:42,700
but I am only building frames which has

00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,409
kind of been great not having the

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,299
problem that I had before or I'd come

00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,249
home from work and just be exhausted and

00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:51,240
have to do what is an extremely

00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:53,920
physically demanding job for me and

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,609
still have the brainpower to get through

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,319
the creative process there so it's kind

00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:01,420
of been kind of an exciting it's kind of

00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:05,139
been you know a whirlwind of figuring

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,090
things out as I go I'm looking into a

00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:09,130
couple different cities right now I

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,200
don't think I'm coming back to Los

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,470
Angeles but I'm not entirely sure I'm

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,720
looking at starting or buying a bike

00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:20,560
shop with a friend of mine

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,270
and maybe doing a in-house brand of

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,650
frames he's got some frame building

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,740
background and I've got my frame

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,900
building so we're looking into doing

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,060
american-made production bikes which is

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,220
really not done a lot here most people

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,520
design bikes here and have them built in

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,190
Taiwan so we're kind of trying to work

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:43,740
on bringing something that would be

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:46,150
completely us made us sourced and really

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,170
I'm kind of all over the place right now

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:52,750
so but it's been great I would not

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,980
change anything kind of taking

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,860
everything and throwing it out the

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,110
window and starting over has been the

00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,800
best thing I could have done for myself

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,020
probably both personally and

00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,330
business-wise I think I would be still

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,510
kind of in a bit of a rut had I tried to

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:11,160
stay in a job and doing what I was doing

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,160
so the risk was worth it

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,300
