Description: 
	In five years' time, kids will look at everything you and I are making today and think it's unconscionably lame, and if you don't think that's the most fun thing in the world then I don't know what.

thank you thank you baby this is really

00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,549
nice thanks for setting this up and it's

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,610
very comfortable and I'm not nervous at

00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:17,689
all um let's see when I when I when I

00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,360
drove here this morning and I was

00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:22,250
parking I first like did parking sucks

00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,230
out there and so first I tried one spot

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,670
and that didn't work and I drove down

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,320
the street and let's try to another spot

00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,029
and I backed in and I needed to measure

00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,500
that I was leaving enough clearance for

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,379
a driveway but also that I wasn't

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,150
ruining the car behind me what she kind

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:39,739
of do as a matter of course in la anyway

00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:43,460
but and I got out of the car to check my

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:45,379
work and I looked at it and I there was

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,910
like an inch of space between me and so

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,530
I did really well and I did want it and

00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,219
I just without thinking about it I did

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:56,120
errands by myself and I did this thumbs

00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:58,070
up which I never do and in the moment I

00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,870
realized that my dad does that thumbs up

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,760
I did my dad's a thumbs up and there was

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,530
even like a kind of a jingle iki sound

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,570
when I did it to like dad's always have

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,850
their key you know they always do like

00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,350
the dad Keys like that um and I realize

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,390
it sort of relates to what I'm talking

00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,049
about a little bit today but it just was

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:22,930
just a little bit of something to warm

00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:27,200
me up and get started talking also um I

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:28,850
wrote my talk on my iPhone and then I

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,590
realized that it would be rude if I was

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,180
up here looking at my iphone the whole

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,710
time because you might I you might think

00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,960
I was on Twitter or something but I'm

00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,909
not so i transcribed the whole thanked

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,119
in two notecards but i didn't have note

00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,820
cards so i took it I took a bunch of

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,159
eight eight and a half by 11 paper and I

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,259
made my own note cards which is about as

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,229
much of a DIY projects and they've done

00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,970
it a long time I think there's probably

00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:54,860
like some sort of a DIY badge for making

00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,829
your own note cards all right you can

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,780
send it to me okay cool great so here's

00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:01,340
my note cards here is my talk I'm going

00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,530
to be looking at these while I talk to

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:09,709
you because it'll work better that way

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:12,079
I'm a nostalgia fiend I'm not sure when

00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:13,940
it started when I was a little kid I'd

00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:16,310
take all the toys systematically from my

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,190
toy box and lay them out every few

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,570
months

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,710
and when you're a kid a few months is a

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:24,090
few years Erika you you're also a

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,250
nostalgia fiend I know this because

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,290
we've shared some emails about like

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,170
collected memories that we had in common

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,510
of like little rascals and stuff like

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,490
that I adore the little rascals little

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,440
rascals in a single best artifact of my

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:42,210
nostalgic memory um but I take the toys

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,240
out of my toy box and I and I'd look at

00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,010
them one by one and I'd like reflect on

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,600
when in my life they used to be my

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,040
favorite toy and how I didn't play with

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,540
them anymore um when when you're young

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,100
there's not really like a cultural

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,690
nostalgia so much because you're not

00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,880
paying attention to culture you're not

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,890
paying attention to TV and movies when

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,800
you're three but what you have with

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,820
these are these artifacts that that

00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,950
embody your memories it's really

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,500
interesting and that sort of stays with

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,940
you as you grow on as you go on in your

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,440
life my sense of cultural nostalgia i

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,500
think i can remember having developed

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,370
from largely having been sourced from

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,370
vh1 like in the in the late 90s early

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,440
2000s when vh1 was doing these like clip

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,209
shows of like remember the 70s i think

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,580
that was the first one correct me if I'm

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,739
wrong maybe pop up video was at the same

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,360
time but they were these clip shows

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,489
where they'd have talking heads talking

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,520
about how stupid we were in the 70s

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:44,700
right and i was born in 78 so i didn't

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:49,800
really remember but it was fun to gather

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:52,350
that approximation of a memory for a

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,510
culture that used to exist but what

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:58,019
doesn't really anymore and then

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,730
something funny happened where like they

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,050
did another one pretty soon lee suited

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,540
soon after that it was remember the 80s

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,920
and like i was there for the 80s so i

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,930
remembered a lot of this stuff and it

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,780
was really dumb stuff like I remember

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,060
how dumb that was and and like I

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,370
realized that the 70s one was all about

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,799
like look how dumb our parents were and

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,320
then remember the 80s was like look how

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,480
dumb we were when we were kids look at

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,480
all the stone stuff we like and then

00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:29,729
like then something miraculous happened

00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,740
after that is like far too soon after

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,259
remember the 80s they released remember

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,460
the 90s like what the hell where are

00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,530
they getting all this stuff why are the

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,910
decades happening so fast you would

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,880
think that like it would take 10 years

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,500
after remember the 80s but it didn't so

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,030
remember the 90s while I was old enough

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,800
to remember a lot of the dumb stuff

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:54,080
though he did in the 90s fashions like

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,080
open you know unbuttoned flannel shirts

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:05,940
I didn't plan joke I just all right so

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,340
what was interesting about remember the

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,190
90s is that was a memory a nostalgia for

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,349
the very recent past something that was

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,300
all still fresh and I think that

00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:17,310
remembering the 90s and nostalgia for

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,159
the 90s happened quicker than any of us

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:24,930
were prepared for in a way because like

00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:26,639
if somebody were to say remember 2009 we

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,039
sort of a vague sense that there was a

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,020
2009 we out there were some fashions and

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,490
styles and things but you don't really

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,270
have a collective like they weren't all

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:40,020
wearing bell-bottoms you know in 2009

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,520
but 1990 there was definitely a 19 in

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,680
the 90s there was definitely a thing in

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,349
the MV enough of a thing for vh1 to make

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,860
a show about it it's like Dawson's Creek

00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:52,289
and stuff like that and then something

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,389
even like stranger happened after

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:56,940
remember the 90s they did something

00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,610
called best week ever where it was

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,770
nostalgia for life the week you were in

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,960
why do you remember what this is like

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,930
blowing blowing my mind how do they even

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,069
do this what's science and alchemy is

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,159
this that they're there they're

00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:14,669
manufacturing oil is nostalgia for the

00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:16,349
time that we're in right now and others

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,419
pretty cool and it was it was like funny

00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:20,880
and they would get some smart comics to

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:24,210
do like I think they paid these comics

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,889
like fifteen dollars total liked it to

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,229
be on TV and then they would have him

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,150
comment on stuff that was going on in

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,710
the news well that was fun but it was

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,870
all just again it was just going

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:38,840
relating back to this this nostalgia

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:41,340
that um I personally really appreciated

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,250
because I've always kind of operated

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:48,720
with this theory in this special sense

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:51,750
that like maybe we don't have fine arts

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,970
that connect assist people so much

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,850
anymore as we used to but we do have

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,950
this common popular culture that we all

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,100
sort of use as a language to relate to

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,980
each other so if in the sense that that

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,050
defines us as a people I'm really

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,870
interested in studying that I want to

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,510
know people I like people and and so I

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,030
like to speak the common language so

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,320
best week ever we were we were

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:21,000
shortening that that cycle of nostalgia

00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,890
so much that we went like we were almost

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,840
closing the loop of nostalgia there was

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:30,150
no more time to catch up and like at

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,150
that point it was best week ever didn't

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,490
last as long because I feel like telef I

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,050
televised media was almost too long of a

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,030
gap and then everything sort of

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,000
transitioned over to the Internet and we

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,710
started getting our manufactured

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,330
nostalgia for them now from the internet

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,450
from tumblr and things like that and

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,550
specifically like I followed just a ton

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,820
of these nostalgia type sites these

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,530
tumblers first of all is bud BuzzFeed

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,080
which is like nostalgia for the now

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,720
mostly it also has like remember or

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,910
BuzzFeed rewind stuff like this like

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,590
what anybody that's like oh I remember

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,560
that toy oh I remember that damn

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,760
Nickelodeon show or remember that

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,280
character on haight did you know like

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,790
all these those fashions that I looked

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,500
ridiculous in eighth grade if you get

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,320
pleasure out of remembering this stuff

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,840
then it's plentiful out there and I'm

00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:27,210
sure a lot of you probably follow some

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:29,010
of that as well yeah another one as I'm

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,360
remembering and then oh there's one

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,800
there's there's this I don't know you

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,240
probably all know about this but video

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,910
time machine it was originally called

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,169
YouTube time machine it's this tool

00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:41,220
that's these these guys made that's

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,290
astoundingly clever and you basically

00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,570
it's a net they have an app for it you

00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:51,000
can because YouTube is this compendium

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,570
of all recorded video culture you Center

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,130
a year

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,690
say what genre you're looking for and

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,990
show you videos that are on YouTube for

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,790
that like okay i was born in 1978 I go

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,500
to 1978 and it shows me an Atari

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:05,430
commercial that aired probably when I

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,200
was like you know in short pants because

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,440
I wore short pants we all were it was

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,090
nineteen seventy-eight the fashion short

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,330
business but anyway the all of these

00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:19,320
these these forms of nostalgia that

00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,020
collectively could have been called like

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,420
look how stupid we were right look how

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,970
look how dumb everything was we're not

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,340
that dumb anymore we're pretty cool now

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,800
like look over wearing look we're

00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,980
watching and look how we used to be some

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:40,620
dumb and laugh at ourselves that stuff's

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:42,180
fun for me like chubby to the the

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,290
current culmination of that is Twitter

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:49,200
where more so than ever we're tracking

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,510
our nostalgia on a real-time basis and

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,890
our current stupidity is always being

00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:57,510
reflected back at us in real time so

00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,130
that like like literally there's no

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,720
collective memory anymore it's all in

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,940
real time so we don't even know what we

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,470
were fascinated by last week I don't

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,600
know like we were all up in arms about

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:12,630
something last week on Twitter I don't

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:15,270
care what it was anyone so why do we

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,240
have nostalgia I asked myself this

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:20,820
because I don't want to just be like

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,470
uselessly fascinated by the past it

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,340
seems sort of wasteful so there must be

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,170
a reason for it why do we have nostalgia

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,590
why do we look back at artifacts from

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:33,480
our past partially it's that we like to

00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,680
remember where we came from because

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,950
that's kind of fun we look at all

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,020
pictures in family photo albums we like

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,030
to know what we used to look like what

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,470
we used to wear it's just memory is

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,380
something is a tool that we have in our

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,279
toolbox that humans enjoy practicing

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,630
using

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:55,839
we like to remember we like to remind

00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:57,860
ourselves how stupid we once were that

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,300
you know that we were embarrassing

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,800
clothes and had embarrassing fashions

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,170
and made an embarrassing choices on a

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,350
constant basis in terms of like who we

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:09,020
what we wore who we liked who we dated

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:12,260
who we hung out with what we believed at

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,760
the time it's all it's all fun to like

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,540
use that as evidence of how we've grown

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,420
as people but that's not entirely a we

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,490
we don't post old photos of ourselves on

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,020
Instagram just because they're

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,290
embarrassing and funny which they are

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,170
well or because we know that they'll get

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,990
us they'll get attention which they will

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,490
and that's fun it's for another

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:39,800
important reason which I wrote on this

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:41,420
next time we remind ourselves of our

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,520
past because we're proud of what we were

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:48,680
and we're proud that we made bold

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,630
choices and we we we made we made both

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,760
choices and we had that specific taste

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,440
and we made those decisions that we

00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,899
exhibited because they came from

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,520
something true because they were they

00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,520
reflected who we really were at that

00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:06,470
point and it might be himself that we

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,790
don't recognize any more even but but at

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,320
least there were decisions and sometimes

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,670
they were bold decisions and

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,480
embarrassing decisions but they

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:17,690
reflected who we really were and we look

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,700
back and we we recognize that we were

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,700
able to make those choices because we

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:26,480
were we were true to ourselves and we

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:29,029
stuck to those choices as at least long

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,050
enough to be photographed you know

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:36,110
wearing those choices or whatever so

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:39,500
that's fun like okay I am I wore an

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,390
embarrassing like have a rayon shirt in

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,620
my eighth grade yearbook photo that was

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:47,209
half black half floral pattern and I

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,760
don't think I warrant a second day after

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:52,940
the yearbook photo but for that one day

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,990
that shirt was who I was and I'm proud

00:12:52,940 --> 00:13:00,140
of that I want to find in a picture like

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,740
it um so there's a tendency to believe

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,570
that

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,640
culture has caught up to it itself now

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,670
in this postmodern age that we've

00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,040
stopped innovating as a culture because

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,820
everything has already been done or as

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,560
already been said and that to me that's

00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,050
the most exhausting and boring and

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,180
depressing concept in the world because

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,480
that's that's thinking like an old

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,100
person that's like thinking like there's

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,149
nothing more to be done might as well

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,770
hang it up but instead we should be

00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:32,630
thinking like a young dumb person who

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,220
doesn't know any better who doesn't know

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,260
that everything has been done before and

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,000
you do something that somebody else

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,100
maybe has done before maybe somebody's

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,600
done this exact talk probably thousands

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,760
of people have done this exact exact

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,050
talk but it's worth saying anyway

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,580
because I'm young and dumb really uh do

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,830
you think that history will look back on

00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,220
on the twenty teens as the time when

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:58,420
culture finally got it right no of

00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,790
course not really up right now

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:05,089
look house look look how slim our pants

00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:07,820
are look out da mente our haircuts a

00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:09,920
hard what what you want is to always

00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,600
lead the kind of life and make the kind

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,230
of choices that you look back on and go

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,589
what was I thinking because that means

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:21,230
you made a bold decision because this is

00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:23,029
how innovation happens part of this

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,620
cycle of innovation is that it's always

00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,010
done by those who are young and dumb and

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:30,829
hungry when Steve Jobs famously said

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,500
stay hungry stay foolish he meant free

00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:36,140
yourself from the fear that comes from

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,880
having stuff and losing it he means be

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,800
young and stupid think like a young

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,360
person who has nothing even you're not

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,070
if you're not young you're an older

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,329
person think like a young person Oh

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,730
incidentally Steve Jobs

00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:52,649
I always like go back and watch this

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,889
video Steve Jobs right before he came

00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:57,389
back to Apple and I think it was 97 and

00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:01,980
he goes to talk to the engineering team

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:07,290
in an auditorium at Apple and the man is

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:11,160
wearing like faded acid-washed jeans

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:16,049
with leather patches black leather

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:18,989
patches but placed elegantly among the

00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:22,920
legs and that's Steve Jobs that's the

00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:24,360
world's coolest person and you will go

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,100
back and you look at Steve Jobs and you

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,779
look at all these suspects fashion just

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,040
sucks back fashion choices that Steve

00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:33,749
Jobs made he wore a lot of vests she

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,459
wore banded collar shirts you know

00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:41,189
buttoned up at the top um but he made

00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:43,739
those does those decisions because he he

00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:47,100
he was bold and he stood by them am i

00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:54,689
running out sanket I'm good good cuz a

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:58,110
lot more it's easy to fall out of this

00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:59,790
habit of making bold choices when you

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,889
start accumulating things like money and

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,350
family and having overhead and stuff

00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,819
like this I'm in the tremendously

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,350
fortunate position of getting to work

00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:10,529
almost entirely with people that are

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:13,470
younger than me which is amazing I'm 35

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:16,279
and I think most of the people that I

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:20,249
work with are young are 30 and younger

00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:26,220
it's really it really energizes me to be

00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:27,629
around younger people I don't feel I

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,189
don't feel like I'm older than the

00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:32,399
people that I work with I don't feel

00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:36,089
like the grandpa on staff and I feel

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,470
like that's a credit to them that's a

00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,329
tribute to the people i work with that

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,939
they energize me in that in that reverse

00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:45,139
direction rather than me having to bring

00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:49,439
them down with my outmoded ideas or my

00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:52,799
grandpa fashions or something so my my

00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:55,230
my tip my pro tip I guess is if you can

00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,179
be around people younger than you maybe

00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,009
you know if you don't have access to

00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,660
younger people in your workplace or

00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:01,510
something like it's fun to follow

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,630
younger people on

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:07,510
Twitter from Simon sighs when I joined

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,490
Twitter I made it a point of two to like

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,520
like accidentally sort of discover

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,079
people a like like young comics in high

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,150
school for so you know I wasn't like a

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,470
joker in high school if I had had a

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,000
Twitter account I probably would've been

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,310
making dumb jokes on Twitter all the

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,699
time well now Twitter exists and they

00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:28,030
let high school students on it so those

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,800
kids say funny stuff and you know and

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,530
they're not yappin about the

00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,150
way the rest of us adults are as much I

00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:38,620
mean most teens are stupid let's be

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:40,090
honest like um so I you know I follow

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,650
some of these people on Twitter I've

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,470
gotten to its Twitter than around for

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,240
six years now holy crap it's funny to

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,760
watch these people grow to like leave

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,190
you know relationships we've made with

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,740
each other over these networks have

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,110
actually developed into these real six

00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:00,190
years is a long time to spend knowing

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:01,300
somebody I know some of my friends on

00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,660
the Internet probably better than I know

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,220
some my family members so it's what it's

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,130
fun to watch these people grow and make

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,770
dumb mistakes just like I did and learn

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,260
and that's kind of awesome and I get to

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:18,010
I get to him okay I already said that

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,930
barn oh I get to watch the people that I

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,760
work with learn things on a constant

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,610
basis that keeps me learning things on a

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,290
constant basis learning is how we stay

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,760
alive you know of your senior citizen

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:32,110
you're supposed to do crossword puzzles

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,940
and and to keep your mind a jewel so

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,620
that you don't age faster that's just

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:44,430
kind of science right I remember being a

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:46,900
young I'm a scientist by the way I

00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,940
remember being young and having my first

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,310
jobs in my early 20s and thinking what

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,140
am I going to stop this up when

00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,180
am I going to turn into an adult and not

00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,210
 up anymore and like not make stupid

00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:01,080
mistakes and not be yelled at by my boss

00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,820
and I do remember my first internship

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,160
you know like my boss gave me one simple

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:10,250
task take the 17 thousand-dollar check

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:13,640
and and walk down the street the in park

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:16,130
slope to the bank and deposit it really

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:21,380
hard to up the check fell out of my

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:26,480
pocket so when am I not going to do that

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:28,880
anymore my advice to the young people is

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,500
you believe I just said that is not to

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,120
worry about that so much you're going to

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,800
stop up because you get older

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,780
and you learn and you get experience and

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,700
you grow and you become an adult and

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,100
that solves itself pretty much on its

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,690
own you don't even have to do anything

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:45,620
just by virtue of being older and having

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:47,690
more experiences if any of you saw Louis

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:52,820
CK's HBO special the one that just aired

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:56,480
he talks about being older and if you

00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,490
want to know something trust the older

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,170
guy who's a garbage man over the younger

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,700
person who's like an academic or

00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,680
something just because the older guy has

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,140
more experience there's more world

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,240
knowledge comply collected in that brain

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,450
than there is in the young arrogant

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,040
person I love hearing that out loud from

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,610
a famous person it's something that we

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:20,450
need to hear more being older is great

00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:22,700
for me in all honesty um suddenly at

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,620
some point in my probably late 20s I

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:28,310
realized that people start trusting you

00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,200
more and it seems kind of it seems kind

00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,170
of arbitrary that people start trusting

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,720
me more and handing you more money it's

00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:39,140
weird and it's just like okay like three

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,570
years ago I was 24 and I was waiting 25

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,520
grand a year and then what I'm three

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,900
years older and now for some reason you

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,330
might pay me more money and you're going

00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,820
to tell have me tell these other people

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:52,640
what to do I guess so I don't know I

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,680
guess I just didn't up enough times

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,320
that they gave gave you more trust

00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:01,220
that's really fun and like for young

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:03,860
people that's what happens it's really

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,270
cool like if I could make a this is kind

00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,100
of tried to save it if I could make an

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:12,080
its be it gets better video for young

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:14,690
people um you know being in your early

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,790
20s sucks it's almost as bad as being 12

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,900
or 13 years old and going through your

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,900
first bout of

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,270
that shift in hormones because you're

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,380
like fresh out of school and me and you

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,000
don't know what you're supposed to be

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,970
doing and you feel like out you're a

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,620
unique snowflake and everybody should

00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,659
finally get the chance to realize this

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:39,059
once you graduate but then like nobody

00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:43,140
cares so much so it's really like it's

00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:46,110
an upheaval in your mental state and all

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:49,230
I can say is just wait it out people

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:53,789
will start trusting you more when you

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:55,950
grow but that's not the challenge of

00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:59,159
getting older not up the

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:04,289
challenge of getting older is this need

00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:08,700
to avoid becoming irrelevant which seems

00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:12,690
to happen I the struggle to stay

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,890
relevant as you as you get older if

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,669
there's a feeling like you had all your

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:24,179
fresh ideas when you were young because

00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:28,140
everything was new it's a challenge to

00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:31,890
stay relevant and I think that we do

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:35,400
that by sort of staying stupid not being

00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:39,120
afraid to up humans are naturally

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:44,250
prone to hate and fear seems kind of

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,950
dark to write on the note we hate and

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,409
fear the new and what's what's new and

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,000
surprising and the older we are the more

00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,799
we hate and fear what's new and

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,070
surprising it's just our natural

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,679
tendency but this isn't just because

00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,510
we're grumpy it's because all of us

00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,880
experience the new as a shock to our

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,700
senses and shock whether it's positive

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,150
or negative shock is destructive just

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,799
like a good workout is destructive it

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,280
breaks you down a little bit so that you

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,840
can build yourself back up because when

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,400
we were bought when we're young our

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,370
bodies are meant to withstand a lot of

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,080
shock everything is new and everything

00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,210
is shocking and everything is exciting

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,620
and painful and awesome all the time

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:31,500
when you're young yeah but I have my

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:39,030
first kid six weeks ago

00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:41,550
oh yeah okay blog his favorite thing in

00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,710
the world I discovered is the thing that

00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,180
he's most entertained by is this dark

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:49,550
blue curtain we have hanging in our

00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:52,350
bedroom it's a curtain it's dark blue

00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:54,750
he'll stare at it and laugh because it's

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,840
it's much darker than the thing is next

00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,330
to it which is the wall which is white

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:02,250
and it was just stare at it and it blows

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:08,280
his mind because he remembers what the

00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:10,260
world was like before the curtain he

00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,430
likes he likes contrast that's his I

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,430
guess that's his nostalgia

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:22,769
but we as growing people we get older

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,139
and we got sick of that we we the

00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:27,870
constant shock is actually more annoying

00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:29,519
than exciting and it hurts us and we

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,289
feel like we don't need that shock

00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,360
anymore because we can't we can't

00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:34,799
withstand it so we gravitate towards

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,340
things that we expect and we stop

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:42,509
growing and we become irrelevant and we

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:44,700
we ruin it for everyone else one saving

00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:46,169
grace is that if you maybe find that

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,210
you're losing your capacity to be stupid

00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:50,340
and innovate in one area as you grow

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,779
older you're probably growing and

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,970
learning to do other things you never

00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:57,059
expected you'd be good at I find that to

00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:00,289
be true personally I'm directing less

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:03,570
than I used to because I guess I'm not

00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:05,669
as fresh or hungry anymore but I'm

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,169
getting better at running my company

00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:10,259
which is which I'm having a lot of fun

00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:12,720
with that's I guess that's just me

00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:15,659
growing into an adult but what I'm

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,889
saying is that not all hope is lost if

00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:21,059
you stop innovating in the in the art

00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:23,129
form you think you're going to be

00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:26,460
innovating forever in there's plenty of

00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:28,200
ways to learn and grow but old people

00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,850
people who have stopped learning and

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,610
growing who have lost the capacity to

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,720
appreciate the shock of the new the

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,909
great thing about them is they

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,909
eventually die and their old ideas

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,190
they're old ideas die and soon enough

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:50,509
gay people can get married just like

00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:53,509
straight people so the challenges we get

00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:55,249
older I'm wrapping this up a promise so

00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:56,690
the challenge as we get older as you get

00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:58,309
older and I get older and we're all

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,330
getting older there's no getting around

00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:04,249
it is to remember to keep being stupid

00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:06,049
keep that capacity for shock and keep

00:26:04,249 --> 00:26:08,259
 up and keep making embarrassing

00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:10,849
choices it's the only way you'll grow I

00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:12,229
wish for all of you that in ten years

00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:14,299
time you'll look back on what you're

00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:18,070
wearing today and you'll be embarrassed

00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:18,070
and proud so if you look ridiculous

00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:23,239
because eventually what happens is that

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,649
ten years becomes 25 or 30 and our kids

00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:27,320
will look back at pictures of us today

00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:29,570
on their embedded eyeball displays and

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,179
they'll go go oh my god my parents were

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,769
so young and hip where did they get

00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:37,549
those incredible slim fitting space

00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:41,779
pants those would cost like 2400 space

00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:44,029
books I'm going to end this talk with a

00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:47,179
string of platitudes don't stop

00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:49,219
believing I believe like Whitney Houston

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:52,789
that children are our future the future

00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:56,539
is now their four children are now the

00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:59,059
future and the future is and will always

00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:01,909
be by necessity every bit as stupid as

00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:04,359
the past past is prologue always be

00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:04,359
stupid

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,020
you

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,130
