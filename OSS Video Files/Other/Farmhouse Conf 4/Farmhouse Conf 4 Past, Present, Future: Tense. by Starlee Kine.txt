Description: 
	An attempt to get to the bottom of whether the future we were promised as kids â€” flying cars, emotionally fragile domestic robots, video phones, quantum leaping â€” is better, worse or pretty close to the one we'll actually get.

hi I came from the future it's really

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,520
different a lot of exciting things

00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:23,630
happening i get to see madman before you

00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:25,279
guys do every week um okay well I was

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,269
trying to think about the future and

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,310
like my main I mean we're obviously we

00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:33,950
living in the future all the time but my

00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,020
main reference you're a kid you don't

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,129
really think you'd only believe the

00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,629
futures gonna happen you don't Lea

00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:41,030
believe you're going to grow up and it's

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,649
very hard to grasp the new actually you

00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,030
have such a different idea of time

00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:45,769
passing like you get excited for your

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,120
birthday's and then you can't and you

00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:49,789
want to be older and all that kind of

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,379
stuff and I feel and and you don't feel

00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,699
like you're you don't feel the passage

00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:54,980
of time the same way so I thought when

00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:57,620
you're a kid the idea my idea of the

00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,510
future at least was all through movies

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,149
and TV shows that's what I that's what

00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,379
gave me telling you what the future was

00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:07,010
going to look like and so I was trying

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:09,619
to make a list of the most the predict

00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,600
like my biggest predictors of the future

00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:13,670
from my childhood and which ones were

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,110
the most accurate that most this list is

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,329
from the most accurate to the least

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,799
accurate so the first most accurate i

00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:24,170
think was quantum leap which also some

00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,220
of these i know some of these seem like

00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,450
they're in the future but they might

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,100
have been present day they might

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,420
everything seemed like present day but

00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,210
they were the future like I don't know

00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,189
when you start sleeping it could have

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,270
been present day and then he's leaping a

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:41,509
lot to the past two but this clearly

00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:45,770
Ziggy lives in the future and Ziggy if

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:47,840
you know Dean Stockwell has this little

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,390
machine lee holds in his hand and talks

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,399
to fig he talks to the boss Ziggy me

00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,560
types in all this information and then

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,450
information he takes him you know words

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,100
and then information comes back so

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,310
obviously that's the iphone like quantum

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:04,399
we predicted the iphone and also so

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,649
that's very impressive and Dean

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,390
Stockwell was on Val star kratika and

00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:10,039
Scott Bakula was on battleship earth

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,530
which I've definitely never seen but

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,200
those seem like

00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,540
pretty I'm sure I'm never ever gonna

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,430
watch that ship earth either but it

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,560
probably takes place in the future until

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,420
those seem like not only did currently

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,340
predict the future with the iphone but

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,510
it also told us that these two actors

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,220
are from the future like they actually

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,709
are and then made youth documentary

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,170
series later on with them what it takes

00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:36,380
place than real times so that's the most

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,420
accurate and then there was issue hi

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,180
kind I'm not even sure if this was like

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,810
a national show I grew up in la suburb

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,940
of LA and there was a show sometimes I

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,370
feel like there used to be like little

00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,450
rascals on on Saturdays and stuff here

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,830
so I don't even know this with a show

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,970
that was interests of the country maybe

00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,150
you guys are all from here but there was

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,920
a show out of this world show i

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,470
predicted skype do you remember there's

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,299
like this girl and she has like like a

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,880
mom he was like a single mom and somehow

00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:07,400
the mom met this alien who dad that you

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,130
never see it's weird i don't have the

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,430
mom at the alien dad it's very sketchy

00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,769
but and then he's a cube he says cube on

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,140
the table and you like lists he talks it

00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,750
grows it's totally skype because it was

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,329
affordable long distance communication

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,609
for its time so that those are really

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,109
good and then this one again and my

00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:29,269
chevy took it seems like it had to take

00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:32,720
place in a future small wonder right i

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:33,890
know it seemed like our time but that it

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,299
was a future because there was this girl

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,430
who lives in the closet which was

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,019
excitement would tell us that r kelly

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,989
was going to doing trapped in the closet

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,880
and which is ahead of its time and i

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:46,820
feel like all the signal if you were to

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,250
go back in the closet is weird enough

00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,900
and small wonders weird enough that I

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,010
better people to go back I mean I

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,540
haven't done this yet I thought of this

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,010
on the plane but I'm gonna go back and

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,940
see how many things match up because

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,560
there has to be cross over

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,750
because she lives in the cupboard and

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,870
it's totally bizarre and we all we all

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,030
were so on board for so long and it felt

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,890
natural same i are Kelly's thinking felt

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,510
natural soon we heard it like where this

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,050
is what we've been waiting for her lives

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,270
even make some no sense and so and then

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,820
to those I think are the front-runners

00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,290
and then there's um and then from the

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,790
ones that you would think are the more

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,910
obvious ones I think kind of suck at it

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:26,040
like Jetsons nothing like heart like

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,680
maybe self-cleaning refrigerators we got

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,950
like that may be predicted that but no

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,570
jetpacks nor flying cars and it didn't

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,330
even predict that women were going to

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,700
like big breadwinners like I feel is so

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,930
it was so backwards in what it was

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,570
telling us the feature was going to be

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,520
for that losses and then back to the

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,470
future is soup is really confusing but

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,120
it's not about the future there's just

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,620
that one line saying back to the future

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,660
but they're in the past and so that I

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,090
think I have to conclude that in the

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,740
category because it technically is the

00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,240
future it's smart could play it safe

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,770
because it's saying tell me about the

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,150
future that is just about the present in

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,090
the past so it can't get anything wrong

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,710
but I feel back to the view journey when

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,210
I watched it do you remember do you

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,669
remember the scene when he goes into the

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,800
diner and he says like I want like a

00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,450
Pepsi free and he's like you can't order

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,550
Pepsi without you should pay for it pal

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:18,030
they're like the past the grumpy waiter

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,400
50s and then Michael J Fox says will

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,900
then give me a tab and I remember being

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,640
a kid in the 80s and being like i'm

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,550
calling on that because no one

00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,530
drinks tab it mateys like it does it

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,330
like it was so clearly like the writer

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,890
is just being like I love this is such a

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,919
clever play on words I'm going to have

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,690
him order a tab and and H if you never

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,180
would do that and I looked it up and the

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,430
tab tab was popular in 60 s and 70 and

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,830
it died out in the 80s because of diet

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,600
coke so i right I don't even know I've

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,220
never met anyone was drink a tab I don't

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,470
know what it tastes like bad dates maybe

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:55,050
or nylon like nude pantyhose because

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,000
uses need to flavor the name is so bland

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,390
aunt but what's weird is that the name

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,850
is so generic and horrible and makes me

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,290
think of like the socks you put just on

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:08,120
the bottom of your feet and that's it it

00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:10,370
just is awful sounding but the reason

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,639
ab actually the name kind of came from a

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:17,600
future machine because how they named it

00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:21,460
was they put 200 they asked a computer

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:26,449
like a giant IBM computer in the 60s to

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:29,600
put the name and it it picked 250,000 it

00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:31,520
like printed out 250 thousand different

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,500
words the dad to choose from like this

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,900
crazy war games kind of computer that

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,010
instead of like fighting against I don't

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,510
know they were like they were like we're

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,699
not quite ready to go to war with being

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,080
it we're doing our first thing is going

00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,810
to be naming the soda that no one's

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,880
going to drink so it had it chose to

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:51,289
50,000 words and then they whittled it

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,550
down to tab which is obviously tab is

00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,530
going to fail because the people the

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,840
most boring people in the world chose it

00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,789
because they had 20,000 words a chance

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,270
from there like definitely tab tab

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:03,830
sounds like a winner and it so I feel

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,630
like they were really bad that machine

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,240
was really bad at predicting and I keep

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,820
thinking like 250 thousand words what it

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,460
was four letter words and then they took

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,010
off the second B and reminded me like I

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,599
was trying to writing me of passwords

00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,820
like when like they chose tab not

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,190
knowing like how maybe talk is a real

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,889
excited word back then it was a welder

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,570
the road movie stars named tab back then

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,550
who I'm think we're boring people

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,169
there's no way that it was ever but

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,360
maybe one guy was like I predict the

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,789
tabs going to be a really great word and

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,310
I feel like I was thinking about um you

00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:40,039
know we pick passwords like I the only

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:42,620
thing I think is worse predictor of a

00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,830
word for the futures our internet

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,500
passwords like I have my password that i

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,139
use for everything you can't change them

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,220
right you mess up look not sure really

00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,270
lets you keep really meticulous notes

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,660
you have to kind of keep the same

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,910
password and i feel all every password

00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:02,000
I've chosen you stood she was like

00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,340
boyfriends names and that I was so wrong

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,539
because I was stuck with this name that

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,830
was wrong like I didn't it didn't

00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:10,760
accurately it wasn't like a magic ball

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:12,590
it totally predicted you would think

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,820
judging from my password that had

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,800
predicted the future would actually just

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,750
predicted that I was like just going to

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,860
be full of regret always like it's a

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,659
terrible thing

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,240
and then and then I had to move from

00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:24,860
that and then I like other I'm not going

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,810
to tell you what my password is because

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,500
the same one for every single thing but

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:33,890
it's from its it's from it's from a

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,329
reality show from a long time ago and I

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,070
can't believe them stuck with it and it

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:40,329
is so insane there's nothing I can do

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,950
there's nothing I can do like I I I

00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:44,779
think about this I have to like pretend

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,579
like it's not actually part of my life

00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:48,740
like I type it in with my eyes closed

00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:49,760
it's so painful but you can't I don't

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,839
know how you're supposed to do otherwise

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,120
because everything is going to keep

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,180
changing so there's no safe word maybe

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,610
tab I mean maybe that might be the an

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,070
oculus choice so I went back to the

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,170
future i think is didn't do a good job

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,000
but the even of it predicting its own

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,950
present because wrong but tab the only

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,360
thing i think it kind of got right was I

00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:13,010
like when I like the way it talks about

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,740
the feeling of being rubbed out of

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,649
existence like when you know like Marty

00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,680
goes back to talk to his to make sure to

00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:23,750
I don't forget why go to save to escape

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,269
the like kind of racist stereotypes

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,760
right so then he goes back and he has to

00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,290
um yeah he accidentally messes up his

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,699
fate makes his mom fall in love with him

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,709
and then he's got to make sure his dad

00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:35,029
and his mom get together so that he's

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:36,560
still born and there's this part where

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,140
he puts his picture on his guitar and

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,100
then at like the more it looks like his

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,540
mom and dad aren't going to be together

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,430
and you start to see his brother fade

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,899
away and you start to see a sister fade

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,820
away and the Michael J Fox starts to

00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,470
fade away and he gets all week and then

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
christman Glover comes up and he kisses

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,640
his mom and then he gets all strong

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:56,390
again and I feel like that sort of

00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:01,339
predicted YouTube because seriously

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:02,750
because ok this is i like i like my

00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:05,269
train of thought but you're gonna have

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,709
to like follow me in general but i

00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:08,180
didn't have really good train of

00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:11,089
thoughts I'm very impressed with my own

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,070
minds because um you have to pay

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,260
attention so there's you know the bus

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,029
back to the future with originally when

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,670
it wasn't Michael J Fox it was actually

00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:24,380
Eric Stoltz was the original Marty McFly

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:27,300
and he was so bad at it that they film

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:31,190
like a third of the movie and then

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,750
no no he is so not what I was imagining

00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,220
that they fired him and then a room from

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,930
the first third that's a lot wouldn't

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,930
use like a screen test or the beginning

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,339
it was a lot the her first third with

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,010
special effects and all that kind of

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,839
stuff and like the delorean part was

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,810
filmed and so then I think they were

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,190
like I think Eric Stoltz was like well

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,930
if I really embarrassed and hurt really

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,519
bad and probably was like lashed out his

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,320
girlfriend that week and was really mean

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,089
to people for a while but then he was

00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,470
like well no one's ever going to see

00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,990
that footage no one's gonna ever see

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,000
them back how bad i was at it luckily

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,130
you can put that behind us i'm getting

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,350
some kind of wonderful and then I can

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,649
kind of make a career and talky like

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,269
more talky films later on he's like it's

00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:14,970
all in our past and then the internet

00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:16,200
was invented and then youtube was

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,160
invented and then that footage

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,709
resurfaced so we thought it had faded

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,959
away but actually nothing ever goes away

00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:27,600
because we know that except for the only

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,160
that goes away is only thing goes away

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,810
is like certain ex-boyfriend so I'm

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,399
really looking for all the time they

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,399
have not surfaced yet to the internet

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,510
but most everything else is on there and

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,640
they were kind of losers I think that's

00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,350
why but I otherwise like everything else

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,810
is on there so I think that picture back

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:47,760
nature did predict YouTube and it's in

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:53,399
its way and then it's right I mean solid

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:56,339
argument here and then um and then the

00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,260
worst so that's almost at the bottom and

00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,760
then this movie I was really obsessed

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,529
with when I was a kid that I definitely

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,920
thought was absolutely the future and

00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:09,209
turned out to be the most wrong with

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:13,440
Space Camp Space Camp um I really loved

00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:15,890
Space Camp and so Space Camp maybe I

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,079
thought all having all seen it it has

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,360
its walking Phoenix his debut but he was

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:24,660
loose Phoenix then because and I

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,550
remember I remember reading this in like

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,459
actually Tiger Beat Magazine this whole

00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,290
explanation of lease Phoenix he was he

00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:34,019
was his family cleaver beings his

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:37,350
brother and his family was River Liberty

00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,600
Sun summer and rainbow and then walk

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,420
came and he felt really left out he was

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,250
the youngest one

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,829
he was really upset that he didn't have

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,350
a nature name like the rest of his like

00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:48,970
weird showbiz family and he so then he

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,889
changed his name to leap and I remember

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,529
like reading this when I was little like

00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:55,180
holding Tiger Beat so close like no my

00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:58,180
nose pressed against the page and just

00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:00,670
devouring this bit of trivia and so he

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:06,699
was Luke Phoenix in space camp and he

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:08,350
was fat the fat kid and he played a p

00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,899
plate you can kind of see it now like

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:14,040
you can see the anger that he exhibits

00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:17,709
now is clearly like his chubby kid past

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,899
but he he which I love chubby kids but

00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:23,230
I'm saying it's there in a he so in this

00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:25,240
movie it's really weird he so these in

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,550
this movie it's he plays like a child

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,800
prodigy and he showed up to space camp

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,290
because he's so smart then he got to go

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,970
to a camp that's how that's how smart he

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,250
is he got to sign up for a camp and

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,440
attend with kids slightly older than him

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,949
like that's his that's mrs. special

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,019
genius ability and like he's like 11 and

00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,579
everyone else is like 15 to 18 and that

00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,959
they're just like well he can't wait he

00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:49,540
can't wait to can't go with kids his own

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,449
age he's got to go with the teenagers

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,209
instead so he shows up and then it's

00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:57,790
also Tate Donovan who I went to novi for

00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:00,100
this american life and I and he all he

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,660
was Jennifer Aniston's and sent he was

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,370
engaged separately in real life to

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,320
Jennifer Aniston and Sandra Bullock at

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,829
different times I never answered why and

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,519
I talked him and now I understand why um

00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:14,500
and then Kelly Preston was in it and she

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,880
like a like a like split on her face the

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:21,100
whole time and um Christine Lahti and

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,180
then Tom Skerritt when I was little I

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,370
went through this phase where I decided

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,290
tom skerritt was like the ideal man that

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,240
was a really bad predict I was with a

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,519
bad future time for me I actually

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,589
remember sitting with a bunch of girls

00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,779
when I was like 11 years old and then

00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:38,199
going like who's who's like a really

00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,430
sexy hot cruel grown-up like at any time

00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,069
like living or dead and they were like

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,899
James Dean and here's him forward and I

00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:45,610
was like Tom Skerritt definitely Tom

00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:48,640
Skerritt

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,110
he's the cool he is the ideal man and I

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,029
don't and this was not because I'm ash

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,920
my parents weren't showing me I was cuz

00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:57,370
i saw space camp and decided that's

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,720
that's who I belong to it one day and

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,269
you also get the same age when I got

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,579
there like that and anyway so anyway so

00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:07,060
the day they all sign up they're really

00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:08,860
good at all of them load space Kelly

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,240
Preston is also a genius which I feel

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,490
like is cheating you kind of two of

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,959
those in one movie but she is and she

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,510
like choose her bubble gum but Shiva

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,300
genius and then and and then take

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,190
Donovan is not a genius but his dad

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,540
signed him up because his dad wants to

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,329
learn discipline by going again to this

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:29,079
like three day camp and in order to in

00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:30,550
order to get in order to get down even

00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:32,050
with the convertible and if he goes to

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,610
this camp and he's really pissed off

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,310
that he's got to go to the camp and he

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:40,390
goes there and Leah totally autonomous

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:43,360
Thompson is also in it um so many people

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:46,149
it's amazing they're speaking about this

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,160
movie um he filia Tom's even and she

00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,829
really loves space and really wants to

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,149
be a pilot one day and she studied

00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:53,860
really hard she's like a Lisa Simpson

00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,470
type probably what Lisa citizens based

00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,230
on its face camp and she studied really

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:03,070
hard but Christine Lahti the teacher

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:05,170
does not let her be like the pilot she

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:08,740
picked a Donovan and says you have to

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:10,720
you're the one who I see something in

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,459
you and you're gonna be the one and it's

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,930
kind of like she's kind of like I guess

00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:15,370
it doesn't say whether he was she taking

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,290
a lesson like she can take on in the

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,660
lesson earlier Thompson like I'm not

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,670
sure if she's actually trying to make a

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,170
better person I think I think some are

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,899
you taunting because she sees herself in

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:28,899
her somehow that kind of movie so she

00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,579
was just I make this seem like a stakes

00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:32,980
involved but actually it's all this is

00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:35,019
all for like a simulation this was all

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,220
like they're all like no Thompson so mad

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,810
that she can't be the pilot of this

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,490
simulation that they do for like an hour

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,170
like that's the whole point of the deal

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,620
but they're no like supposed to go in

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:49,540
space that's supposed to but there's a

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:51,100
robot right and he's like this I can't

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,040
remember his name like thing or

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,580
something and he he he's a robot and

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,550
he's like this little trash

00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:01,610
thing that rolls around he really looks

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:04,280
like he was built from radioshack parts

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,810
at like it looks like they put all the

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,820
budget didn't going to radio shack and I

00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,650
had the best like one guy got a really

00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,140
good Commission raincheck that day and

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,810
it's got like like those like heavy

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,520
caster wheels that you buy like office

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,580
depot Descolada like that's what heroes

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,260
around on and he's totally a fake r2d2

00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,620
and you've got like a little thing that

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:27,440
comes up and he and Joaquin Phoenix are

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,210
best friends because obviously they've

00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,550
totally bond and it's like this whole

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,250
other plot like everything is like super

00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,200
real and like sexual tension between

00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,510
everybody and grownups and Tom Skerritt

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,370
and then there's a separate plot of lee

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,290
phoenix / friending a robot who's like

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,000
magic like actually i robot not like a

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,010
like a robot who could think and feel

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,310
that they came up with Vanessa's plot

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,050
and then Lee Phoenix chick saying like

00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,310
he gets enough fight and they tell him

00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,140
that he and he says he has no friends

00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,000
and then he tells a robot he wants to

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,070
like go into space forever and then they

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,280
go into the rocket to do their

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,440
simulation and the robot thinks it has

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,480
feelings and he thinks oh I need to send

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,590
Lee Phoenix who one day what pewaukee I

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,960
need to send him into space so that he

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:11,600
can go and be watching Phoenix one day

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,310
and so he like program something and

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,490
then he sends them into space and then

00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:18,470
it turns and just other kind of movie

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,960
also radioshack effects because like

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,580
it's like you see them in the simulator

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,870
you see them in the spaceship and then

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,780
you see like some footage from another

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:29,360
from like the 70s wing and like a smoke

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,890
machine in the nerd space and then after

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,990
a fair how to get down from space and

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,720
oxygen running out and it really

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:38,120
stressed out and walking it leave

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,040
Phoenix put today well that goes out

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,050
into space which they put him in a

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,390
little could be the smallest and he they

00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,640
said

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,800
into space and he almost loses his

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,690
tether line and if I could it really

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,700
pleased also made like a dollar so

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,910
there's all happens I'm continue low

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,530
budget and I'm still Leah Thompson's

00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,450
like pissed off but she isn't good pilot

00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,250
all the time and tom skerritt down it

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,440
like command headquarters been like we

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,640
just sent a bunch of kids into space and

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,500
you're just like that's like a cost a

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,730
lot of money but then no one talks about

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,230
that like it really is just like the

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,900
robot can do this thing and then send

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:13,380
them up and it gives you a really skewed

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,810
perspective of economics in the 80s so

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,150
then they go into space they get oxygen

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,940
tank they go back down the movie and

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,170
they can't afford to like have them do

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,250
another scene where they come out so

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,720
like the movie yet you just feel like

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,980
the jets go out and then you see Tom

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,050
Skerritt I kind of give a high five to

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,420
someone and then it credits it's amazing

00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,800
I'm actually recently and it all happens

00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,210
I'm very accurate my description

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,070
everything I just said is true nothing

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,470
is wrong about what I just said so this

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:41,400
happened and I was like this is when I

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:43,770
was little I thought is the greatest

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,150
thing I want to be I want I want our all

00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,800
these things to happen I want to be

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,750
every tear to this movie I want

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,070
everything that happened in this movie

00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,850
to happen to me over the course of my

00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:55,860
life at different stages and a nothing

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,960
up with Tom scared at the end and then

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,480
but um and I definitely wanted to go

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,060
into space and I wanted to have a I mean

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,430
it goes without saying that I wanted to

00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,260
have a robot best friend but that's we

00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,940
all wanted that and this was like the

00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,470
best kind of robot but I feel like I

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,660
went through a lot of robots by that

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,730
point and like I was like I'm I ride in

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,500
one short circuit I didn't want Vicki

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,000
from from under eyes I wanted this robot

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:23,970
like he seemed like the best one very

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,460
portable and he so since I been recently

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:31,590
the summer I actually this I was sent to

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,480
space camp thanks he went to space real

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,520
space can't adult space camp which is a

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,560
thing it costs five hundred dollars

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,080
which makes made me fish being

00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,850
suspicious but I was like that must be

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,460
because they haven't inflated the prices

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,810
since the 80s like they're so that

00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,940
they're just they're just trying to door

00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,830
just trying it says time capsule of the

00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,640
past in the future and so I went to

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,790
adult space camp and

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,470
it's in Alabama I like you're like yes

00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:03,280
of course I said I know it is have you

00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:04,600
been yeah so then so I mean Alabama was

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,280
not what I was thinking when I watched

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,370
Space Camp I didn't even know Alabama

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,500
was a state when I was a little kid that

00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,870
was not what I was picturing and so I go

00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,180
and I'm really excited and what I

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,520
thought no I'm stronger just died I was

00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:22,240
feeling very very romantic about space I

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:26,140
had my tom skerritt crush had faded and

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,970
i totally i had like I totally I don't

00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,460
think I've had had a bigger crush on and

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,810
on someone since Tom scare as I had on

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,490
your Armstrong look at the week after he

00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,880
died like it was those stories were the

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:39,070
greatest things and I I suspect he's a

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,080
Republican but it just didn't matter it

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,640
was I kept this thing like you like

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,620
Lincoln sty Republican he was like a

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,330
Republican that bad did they world that

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,510
didn't count back then and you just

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,520
every story is just so amazing and I

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,530
loved him I kept looking at the moon and

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,550
just being like all these footprints up

00:21:53,530 --> 00:22:00,370
there or unless it's up there for me and

00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,570
then I thought like I was thinking an

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,010
oath even thing like conspiracy

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,220
theorists probably even feel something

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:08,020
like they're watching 2001 and feeling

00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,580
like the moon landing didn't happen but

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,740
they'll probably watched curiously that

00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,660
week like everyone felt something that

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,070
week I feel like after he died I loved

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,900
him and so I was really excited to go

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:20,170
and I said this is that I thought I was

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,150
I was I wanted to see who was gonna go

00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,370
to Space Camp beside me I wanted to know

00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:27,460
who these adult space campers were and I

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,500
really assumed everybody was going to be

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,060
Lea Thompson like everyone was going to

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,530
be like people who just maybe they

00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,000
signed up the date the nightmare on

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,470
trunk died like maybe they just were

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,380
like oh my god I always want to go to

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,330
space I'm finally gonna do this I like

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,590
I'm not gonna come in a space camp but

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,110
like I feel like it I thought it would

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,510
reach in robes on like dying hopes and

00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,280
dreams and the space programs not what

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,460
it used to be and I was just very

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:55,060
romantic about what I thought about it

00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:57,970
going into it and I get there and first

00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:00,910
of all well it so it's noah bama and

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,500
it's also really hard to I mean the

00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,049
website is really bunk and it's really

00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,610
hard

00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:07,190
it's I should have been tipped off by

00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,769
that like it's like just scheduling the

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,480
way they do the scheduling it's like

00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:15,230
August 2012 and then like right below it

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,759
is like 2014 if through like 18 like

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,129
it's like if you do it one wrong

00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,480
drop-down menu thing took Lake you're an

00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:22,850
earring different you're already like in

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,950
a different year and it's really hard to

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,019
eat I thought that was just like oh

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,159
they're so busy working on Space Camp

00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:29,600
that they don't have time to update the

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,860
website I didn't really didn't like a

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,869
literal translate I do like the

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,669
photograph of legends like that

00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:37,909
drop-down menu with what the place

00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:44,960
looked and felt like it just is so it

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:46,429
was so run down and and and and not I

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,580
don't even think it was like it I'm a

00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:52,399
single authentic space artifact they're

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,499
like it looked a lot of loot the rocket

00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:58,249
look like the ones that you ride outside

00:23:54,499 --> 00:24:01,279
of a supermarket thank you really and

00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:03,739
then and you had to they don't give you

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,929
you didn't get you had to pay extra to

00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:07,999
get a jumpsuit otherwise they just gave

00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:11,509
you like a really cheap cotton t-shirt

00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:14,090
like a hard cotton t-shirt extra lot

00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:16,489
like all the sides of the same size it

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,690
didn't matter pretty I get a small

00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:20,570
woman's and it was like the same thing

00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,940
as an extra-large guys no such hard hard

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,039
hard cotton on my skin and like like

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,169
that that really glossy kind of silks

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,210
like that thing they put on it yes

00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:32,029
sticker and then and then you could buy

00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,440
a jumpsuit and one guy bought the

00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:36,529
jumpsuit and you wore at the entire

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,989
weekend I can't tie your weekend and you

00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:43,039
like I think he was he'd work he's from

00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:45,529
Albany and he had like a I guess hehe

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,509
dad he didn't work in the post office we

00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:48,980
had that kind of job and he wore p but i

00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:51,080
liked i did like him because it was like

00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,739
his bright blue jumpsuit that i never

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:57,590
didn't see him have on and um and then

00:24:54,739 --> 00:25:00,259
the rooms of your bunks and they were

00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:04,580
but they were honest they were the

00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:05,960
bleakest they're so bleak like I felt

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,909
like there was no I don't think it was a

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,769
mattress on the cot if he hardened metal

00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:11,600
bunks and they kept being like this is

00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:13,220
to show you how they slept in the space

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,769
and I was like no no no this is like

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,389
this is this is like the rooms of the

00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:18,740
subway that I see people like I he

00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:20,749
maintenance workers like storing things

00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,549
in that makes me sad for everyone's

00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:24,950
lives and jobs like this is it was so

00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:29,749
depressing and obviously bright lights

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:31,789
and hard bunks and then and and there

00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:35,990
was no um it just was like a three-day

00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:37,779
program and I was I thought it was a

00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,669
no-brainer that you're gonna get the

00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:43,490
anti-gravity right that right you

00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:45,259
nodding again yes and that's why you go

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,659
and I was like I guess anti-gravity

00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:49,789
costs five hundred dollars they go a

00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:51,379
hundred dollars of you like I didn't

00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:52,850
logically make sense but I was like just

00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:55,309
no way they're gonna say space camp and

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:58,580
you don't get it go walk on anti-gravity

00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:01,820
that didn't happen not even close and no

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:07,100
I mean well my group first of all was

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:09,169
full of their really old everyone in my

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,929
group like I just strange given us fine

00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:14,330
but they were like nobody was there

00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:15,740
could like space I went one by one not

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,970
even the guy in the jumpsuit everybody

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,850
went because they'd already gone

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,470
everywhere else but like not anything

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,240
else like I hadn't gone to anywhere

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,159
great like big most them hadn't left the

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,359
country but they already gone like every

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,980
cruise and like every amusement park and

00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:34,220
NASCAR and then they're like I guess

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,409
Space Camp nobody had like any a single

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,379
story about like looking up at the stars

00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:41,779
when you're young or even like watching

00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:43,759
the movie ending like nothing these

00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:45,889
people would have were there drinkman

00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,779
demanding and nothing there was just

00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:49,190
like I guess and also I thought

00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,749
everybody was going to be I thought we

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:54,169
were in a recession and then I realize

00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:55,639
that I'm in a recession but not like

00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:56,690
they also like just had like they're

00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:58,879
like we have five hundred dollar bills

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,289
that we spend on new things like no one

00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:02,059
seemed I thought they would like to

00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:04,759
squirrel away their money and they were

00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:07,369
just like we have to go and see the

00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:08,989
final frontier no they were just think

00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:10,190
some of them wanted like to rise wanted

00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:13,070
to send them away for the weekend there

00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:16,970
was nothing and they all end they and my

00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:18,540
my teacher later said it was the lamest

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,430
group he'd ever seen like a lay

00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:23,130
in the space camp group he was so

00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,960
exhausted this guy like he was so here I

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,420
rolled his entire time to the thing and

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,440
he so they and it was like in like they

00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:33,150
were older and complaining like everyone

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,090
complained a lot and there was like a

00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:37,530
time we had to go take a bus across the

00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,270
street once to like shoot off these

00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:42,090
bottle rockets which is like the coolest

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:44,250
part but I was not about space and we

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,840
did we took a bus and he said normally

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,060
walk but I couldn't I couldn't I

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,200
couldn't chance it which could drop it

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:54,990
straight and and there was like one time

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,610
when I I got away the spacesuit there

00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,590
wasn't anti-gravity I'd always harnesses

00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:01,020
and I was being dangled and I gotta do

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,190
it and I was like I thought I thought I

00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,750
was taking a turn but he was like you're

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,180
only would survive this like there's a

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,400
so no one else who can do this and all

00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,560
this stuff like you went into I think he

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,030
was actually the same cockpit and stuff

00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,490
the dance from space camp but it was

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,560
also may be the same like the same props

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,450
like I think it was like the same bear

00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,770
boots like the no one had worn since

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,510
then like there's everything was so

00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,130
nasty and dirty like I didn't take

00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,690
Donovan took off his globs of liminal

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,580
Walker know like that's good we're not

00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:29,370
gonna we can you buy any more from half

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:33,690
went on and so we were all wood stove

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:35,370
and so there's nothing physical there

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,140
was a lot of like it was so embarrassing

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,760
like there's a pilot the people got to

00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,590
be pilots they're always like gadgets

00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,360
and stuff and they like udah not over

00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:44,460
the guy like the knobs and switches away

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,070
kids do they were just like so dazzled

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,230
by that and but and then but again

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,900
everyone was pretty unenthused but the

00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,800
the ring later again and there's people

00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:59,220
there's this one woman who really she

00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,930
was this woman I can't so physically she

00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,600
I only she was I could not that old and

00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:05,550
she wasn't like that she was she was a

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,290
kind of body that like has missing a

00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,330
part like she like a fruit of the loom

00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:11,520
body like it's like a torso and legs

00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,370
like I wasn't that I swear it was just

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,290
like it was just like like a thing I

00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,180
guess but she didn't get was a little

00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:21,930
thing that was not there and she was

00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:24,020
really cocky and um we're short flawed

00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,370
and had seen everything and gone

00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,320
on all the cruises and was constantly

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:31,190
comparing Space Camp to this other stuff

00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,960
and he just it really fell flat but not

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,370
for the reasons that I thought it fell

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,160
flat which was like comparing it to the

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:40,550
like the glory like I got highest moment

00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:42,020
in the nation she was just like oh she

00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,520
just didn't really she didn't like that

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,960
she wasn't in charge she wanted to be in

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,220
charge everything so when she wasn't

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,910
picked for something she'd be like a

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,650
NASCAR I gotta stand in the front row

00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:53,120
and this didn't happen here and she

00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,190
always name-dropping but she name-drop

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,420
like people that she met at NASCAR like

00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,370
an audience which is she was like a

00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,070
chronic name-dropper but like there was

00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,150
just no way and then when I was writing

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,280
about it you what she tried to name drop

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,960
me at one point not that she knew my

00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,390
name but she just was like latched on

00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,760
and I shut her down like she said I want

00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,710
to tell my friend I want to link to your

00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,240
article or tell my friends and I said no

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:18,590
you're not allowed you all should ever

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,300
speak about it um and but so but really

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:24,590
says she was always complaining and

00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:26,690
there was and she would try to she would

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,790
not happy unless she was in a leadership

00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:30,380
position and if she wasn't she was

00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:33,530
really bad at being leader obviously and

00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,120
she did it you have to show up and get

00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,950
assigned your ranks and stuff like that

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,540
very much like space camp in that regard

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,460
like there's someone who's just like you

00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,510
you get to be a pilot you can be

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,160
commander you could be a child prodigy

00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,680
you could be like the best friend robot

00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,030
and she when she was the whole time

00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,830
talking about she wanted to show up be

00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,480
she was mad that we get to do two

00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,970
simulations and simulations are just

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,130
like there's a like a like a committee

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,860
or the pilot area and then there's like

00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:59,750
a lot of jobs in the Command Room the

00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,090
tom skerritt room were just like looking

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,440
at fake screens and pushing things and

00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:05,390
nothing matters under your reading room

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,920
booked but she was really mad that she

00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,840
had to be in that room last time does

00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,790
she wanted to be out of a pilot or

00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,980
putting the harness my harness and like

00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:14,450
shouldn't you know that the guy would

00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,520
have been like he didn't want to go to

00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:18,860
jail so he like she was really upset

00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,410
that she kept saying she was so fit and

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,150
then she showed up late and she so she

00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,530
got a really bad job in the commander

00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:26,160
room and she was really mad about that

00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:29,850
and so we had to do this like

00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,530
45 minute simulation and she while

00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,180
you're doing in here just like binder

00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,590
and you're reading all these coordinates

00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,780
and nothing makes any sense we're not

00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:39,270
learning and I definitely got Dumber

00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,460
doing this whole thing like I know so

00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,410
much less about space and even like

00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,960
office supplies like from this bigness

00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,950
room and so when you have headsets and

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,930
you're and you're reading this

00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:51,780
coordinate to each other and this woman

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:54,930
while we did it pull down her plan book

00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,880
and try to like um kind of started

00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,740
making plans about her life like pick up

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,330
my son from soccer do this and kind of

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,160
and but she was doing it into the

00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,960
headphone so the entire time while we're

00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,870
doing this thing we could hear her just

00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,190
being like three o'clock okay show up in

00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,840
guide some groceries are getting tired

00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,160
time for 45 min and she kind of like

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,860
their name dropping things stick to

00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,750
herself in there and it was amazing and

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,930
everybody no only time I bonded with

00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:20,880
anyone that room was that by one by one

00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,080
we all started to we all stopped talking

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,150
y'all looked at her and there was this

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,840
woman who was like really really like a

00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:29,370
like a church leader and she was so

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,930
cheery and positive of everything and

00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:33,000
the one coin we looked over and she just

00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,920
like rolled her eyes and like I started

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,450
laughing and I I loved her for that

00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,420
because we were because everyone's on

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,880
the same page was this woman um and then

00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:45,480
um so that was crazy but it made me

00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,550
think you know it was a tailor it was a

00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,670
bummer I was really sad about it because

00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:52,350
I felt not only did it ruin a really

00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:55,410
good movie for me but it made me feel

00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:58,740
like there's not a lot to hold on to

00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:01,470
like if you can't have some spark of

00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,380
hope or optimism at Space Camp which was

00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:07,650
what the embodiment of like what we once

00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,720
strived for in this country I'm like

00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:12,720
what what is there left and it also made

00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,430
me think that like what dislike the

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,470
power of someone being that annoying how

00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,000
she can just like how that Tiffany so

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,720
effective that can actually rally the

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,900
group more than men a good person and I

00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,780
went home and I I've been writing a book

00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,550
for a long time a really long time and

00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,290
it's not finished and I have a real hard

00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:34,140
time writing it and it's become really

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:37,170
confusing because now it's personal and

00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,960
now I'm writing

00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:42,600
past version of myself and it's really

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,610
weird a guy find it but I must have make

00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,320
it seem like present and I feel like I'm

00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:49,890
different behind and I don't really know

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,230
what to do about this and the longer I

00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,940
spend writing book the more like I feel

00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,830
like all I'm thinking about is a future

00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,690
when this book is done and it makes me

00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,700
like very very much not live in the

00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,380
present like to the point where like I'm

00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,780
it's like one day I'll be able to go

00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,950
ikea and by picture frames and frame the

00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,210
stuff that's been in my closet for five

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,980
years kinda not allowed to good idea

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,240
until this book is done and so like

00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,750
every single day i look at these like

00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,550
unframed posters and stuff and I get

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,230
really sad that I can't have art on my

00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,780
rouse because I haven't finished a book

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:21,060
like it gets the spirals get really

00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,250
insane and so if you don't harden her

00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,320
the more I go towards the long has been

00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,090
the present not achieving this future

00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,250
and then having to think more and more

00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:32,310
about my past self and reconcile it with

00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:34,169
this present person that I am everything

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,780
that gets Messier and Messier and I have

00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:38,400
this writing space that I use it's all

00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,530
going to remember my train of thoughts

00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:44,490
are smart and good so I was writing

00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:46,980
space that i use and i don't like it and

00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:51,260
i run the reasons i use it i went like a

00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:54,419
cubicle in the future new york and um

00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,710
one of the one of the reasons i use it

00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:58,920
because the people really irritate me

00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:01,290
like I think I know something film I

00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,490
keep it up I don't think I don't know

00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,860
anyone's doing in there I don't know

00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:06,540
what they're doing so and I like it

00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,520
makes me work i'm really not social

00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,990
there cuz i don't there's nothing I want

00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,970
to talk to so I makes me feel like I'm

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,780
forced like I'm both punching myself by

00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:18,510
hate going there and I'm making myself

00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:22,860
work by having to stay tuned for a lot

00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:24,930
of strangers and so um but the more I

00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,610
spend reading book the law the more

00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,320
unpleasant is to go to the space because

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,820
it just now the space is representing

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,140
like I'm afraid I can't look at our

00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,370
emails for how long I've been into space

00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,020
cuz I'm showed me how long I've been

00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,330
writing this book and I can't I know my

00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,640
dog is I got my dog around the time i

00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:40,050
said my book I can't look at email so

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,970
tell me how old he is gonna know how I

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,280
can't crunch the numbers to see how long

00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,930
in the writings but I know out there

00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,190
things have happened but I'm afraid I

00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,940
refused to acknowledge in the last like

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:53,460
four years but anyway so if this writing

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:57,750
space those were the rules is that you

00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,310
can't you can't eat in their chairs

00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,990
cubicles and you can't talk in there you

00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,450
can talk in the kitchen you can't talk

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,940
in the cubicle area oh and you can eat

00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:08,850
because it takes me you know smells and

00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,740
it you make its loud kind of meals and

00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,570
they recently put up a sign saying

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,920
there's an ant problem so don't make

00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,290
sure make sure you don't eat in there

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,580
that's sign I'm fine with that I don't

00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,430
want to I don't have people chewing

00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,960
their food either but in the kitchen

00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:25,020
where all the people I don't talk to our

00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,610
there's a candy dish right and it

00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,190
usually has like tootsie roll like a

00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,970
cheap candy like 20 rows until like that

00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:36,060
almost always do let's go to one

00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:38,520
recently they put lollipops out like

00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:42,390
clear those clear lollipops with like

00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,770
crinkly wrappers and I took one without

00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,080
really thinking like I didn't really I'm

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,910
like I'm craving either tootsie rolls or

00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,050
lollipops but you take it and then newsy

00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,270
what the tootsie rolls like take them

00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,400
into the writing room unwrap a few eat

00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,010
them fast it's done I took a lollipop

00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,550
and I went into the writing room and I

00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,420
was sucking on the lollipop and

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:04,050
something I shall just tap on my

00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:07,020
shoulder and it was some like horrible

00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:10,650
person the stranger who told me this

00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,960
woman and she said um you can't you

00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,820
can't eat here you're the rule as you

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,050
can't eat in here and I was like I know

00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,520
it's a lollipop she's like there's a

00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,920
sign and everything you can't even hear

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,390
and it was clear I could tell in her

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,320
head that she the reason she was saying

00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,630
is because she thought she was writing

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,780
something so good for readers digest and

00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:30,180
or something that she I had interrupted

00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,010
her like I'd taken a writer of flow and

00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,660
that was really important and that's

00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,220
when she was and she decided it was

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,660
worth interrupting whatever I was doing

00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,670
in order to like put me in a bad mood

00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,480
and tell me I couldn't eat and I was

00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:44,400
really upset and um I made like a big

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,040
show I got all my stuff up and I was

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,690
like fine I was upset because I really

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,610
principally bleed that I was not eating

00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,040
food i was eating candy it was supplied

00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,450
from the kitchen and so i got my stuff

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,920
and I'm not does not normally me this is

00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,630
what this place is turning me into

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,760
and that not having written a book

00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,500
thankless we've done so i picked up my

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,410
stuff and I went to another cubicle like

00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,000
really loudly like I have a Velcro like

00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,210
my computer cases like a Velcro closure

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,500
Alex they'll put it up really loudly and

00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:15,210
and and then I tried to sit down a World

00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,470
Provost I couldn't do it come on

00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,180
something I was Larry David like

00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,069
something I turned into the other person

00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,599
and I went out into the kitchen and

00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:24,630
there's an office for the administrative

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,730
people are and I asked if it was I said

00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,470
when you said no eating does that

00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,960
include candy I need to know if it

00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,880
include the candy and the woman said the

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,410
woman the office said no I mean we don't

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,329
we didn't have to get we're not really

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,730
being specific but probably no it's fine

00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:40,589
I like thank you and I didn't go back

00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,940
and tap the woman on earth the horrible

00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:43,410
person on her shoulder I just went and

00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:47,220
had a peace of mind knowing but I was

00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:49,200
right i sat down didn't work at all and

00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,880
then probably watched like looked at

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,210
take on a bit on MTV or something and

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,829
then got up a little while later and I

00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:59,119
noticed the sign and hid something

00:38:55,829 --> 00:39:03,230
written in sharpie um no eating

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:06,299
including candy I was really really mad

00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:08,160
and so then I went back into the office

00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:09,299
I never talked to the office ever it's

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,369
next to the kitchen the door's always

00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:13,849
open I've never spoken to these people I

00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:16,980
went in and I said I don't need to know

00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:20,549
did you hang put the including candy or

00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,799
did someone else and they said they said

00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:25,140
well no he wrote that I said but I know

00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:28,619
you told me a little while ago two hours

00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,540
ago that candy was fine and no girl

00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,430
looked at me in face and she like gave

00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,839
me this look that was and she said well

00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,180
some people have been complaining and

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,240
the look she gave me was was like I

00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:41,400
would rather deal with you being upset

00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,230
then with this other person so the

00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,319
person's more annoying wouldn't louder

00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:49,470
for the person's more aggressive she

00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:52,079
scares me she's crazy I meant appease

00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,910
her and not make you happy and it

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,500
reminded me like your mind it was like

00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,210
the same it was like a similar type of

00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,410
this space camp woman I felt like it was

00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,910
just like these people who'd kind of

00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,290
like his irritant into their life

00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:06,420
whoever you get the

00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:07,710
way and it also reminded me of this is

00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,360
going to kind of topical but actually

00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:11,100
minding me of the gun control debate

00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,870
would happen recently and serious

00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,780
because you know that gun control thing

00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:18,090
that happened was not the majority the

00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,700
country wanted it and the majority vote

00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:22,800
got it right we voted and the majority

00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,800
voted but then the minority gotta win

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,890
they got like 60 40 and a nerdy one and

00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,780
so even though most people wanted it the

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,070
minority one and they were and the

00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:36,840
people were appeasing they were

00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:39,320
basically happy they were out there more

00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:42,840
fine with letting majority of us

00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:46,380
rational folks being happy than

00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:49,800
upsetting the crazy nuts right that was

00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,480
her louder and you know make more

00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,740
appearances and so that was like that

00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,600
was the deal they struck their like

00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,370
that's okay we know that most of you are

00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,630
worried about your lives and your kids

00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,520
live we're just going to appease these

00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:02,910
people and it really reminded me of that

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,650
and also I want to point out i give you

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,130
the rationals gun control this lollipop

00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:10,170
thing because the lollipop thing

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:12,690
lollipops by definition suckers require

00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,760
time to be to eat them so it's not I

00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:16,890
couldn't even I could not even there's

00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,930
no way I could have eaten this not in

00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:20,430
the work area unless I decided to talk

00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:23,270
to the horrible people so like I feel

00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:25,590
like I'm so I was definitely Hajek

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:27,390
illogical about what we're trying to

00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,950
stop and then it's always like people

00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:32,870
who are just like no we think it's

00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:35,700
really rational to to put out bowls of

00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:37,170
candy that takes a duration of time to

00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,110
eat and then tell you that you can't

00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,340
actually take time to eat them like I

00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,600
feel like that that's what they're

00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,650
trying to say and then you people

00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,790
enjoyed you're like yes that makes sense

00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:47,190
we don't want here to shut up you're

00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:49,170
annoying and so it makes me sad and I

00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,300
was watching actually that i was

00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,740
watching the press conference about one

00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,690
day gave after the gun control didn't

00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,610
pass the latest one and i don't want

00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,160
like i've never seen a sadder satyr one

00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,460
like I you see a bomb and you see

00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,180
everyone

00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,890
faces like the Newtown family and his

00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,420
guard and Biden's up there and they all

00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,430
look really sad and then I the one i

00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,350
watch the camera zoomed in and like just

00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:11,880
the background you continue in face ever

00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:15,000
Baumann you just had like just like the

00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,920
frowns frowns brown faces it was so sad

00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,690
and Obama was talking about how this

00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,940
isn't over we're still going to fight

00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:22,260
and I was just like really like we're

00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,500
still going to call people and make sure

00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:27,930
that they uphold the law that we have it

00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,220
was just so I know I know I shouldn't

00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:32,370
give up but it made me really really sad

00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,930
and really just like what are we what is

00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:36,810
the future what is what's going to

00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:41,970
happen to us so then I was thinking

00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:44,490
actually about the Space Camp oh I have

00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:47,490
I i I'm ready to talk I'm here I'm sorry

00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:50,340
really okay how about I gone five

00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:56,700
minutes long I have five minutes oh I

00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:58,920
haven't gone wrong men oh thank you um I

00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:03,290
was worried I'm gonna have to few things

00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:06,600
to say now just chatter box over here um

00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:07,980
but I was I did I I'm so tempted and I'm

00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,170
like it's all hopeless but it was funny

00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,370
thing is I be positive no I was until

00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,310
then I would that be thinking I did his

00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:15,840
other story about this I don't know I do

00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,920
it for this american life and is this it

00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,310
was a story about the Ronald Reagan

00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,330
Presidential Library and I went and the

00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:24,390
wrong making presidential libraries

00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:25,950
really crazy because kids can go and you

00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,450
can Nicky's field trip little kids like

00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,530
an elementary school engineer I can take

00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,570
these field trips where they can be

00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,090
Reagan you can like go to the White

00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:35,100
House and you sit at his desk and you

00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,420
there's a jar of jelly beans on the desk

00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,380
your knowledge of touch and I tell he's

00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,700
like a little kid and it'll get 2x

00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,110
elevating and they're just like do not

00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,240
even think about going near those

00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,950
jellybeans oh and there's three things

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,600
there's like a military room and there's

00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:48,000
a press room and there's over office and

00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:52,410
some kids everybody's there's like a

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,610
random like throat you today going to be

00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:57,150
wrong Reagan and they have to decide

00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:59,220
whether or not to invade grenada what

00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,960
I'm not going to go into but because I

00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,070
certainly didn't remember about what the

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,260
details of invasion

00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,880
until I went to this do the story but

00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,130
they to decide whether or not to do it

00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,660
and they tell them that they've all it's

00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,850
up to them there's not there's no wrong

00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,190
answer and then one the little kids I

00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,930
saw this little really popular kid

00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,130
obviously i'm guessing i know he's

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,920
popular for a fact you know he didn't

00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:21,690
tell me but he was he chose to invade

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,300
grenada and then I just like always like

00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,340
oh ding like he's like um like kind of

00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,350
congratulatory dings glass and like he's

00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,570
like he's won a prize and then later on

00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:33,210
there was his very thoughtful kids who

00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:34,860
were like a blazer that he didn't suck

00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,630
it on field trip outfit and he looked

00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,580
like Tom Hanks like the character and

00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,230
big after he's become like an adult and

00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,430
Bill Veck to be a kid like your suit

00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,040
looks so big on him and he was so

00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,600
thoughtful and he chose not to make me

00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:49,080
after hearing all these very logical

00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,610
things and he when he did that like this

00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,020
like a lot just buzzer would go off

00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:54,720
they'd be like no wrong answer and then

00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,280
he'd say an on meeting her name and it

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,710
was really sad and this kid looks so

00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:02,040
struck like he was just so devastated

00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:04,620
that he like he like he'd put people in

00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,930
danger and he that like he was felt here

00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:08,760
was a vice president that he didn't have

00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:10,380
that he would consult with every single

00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,880
time and I wasn't part of the rules

00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,470
there was this little girl that I think

00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,470
had a crush on and he'd just like what

00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:18,690
do you think mrs. lady vice president is

00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,490
really cute but he's kid actually gave

00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:23,790
me a lot of hope and i was thinking like

00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:27,210
you know i went to one place and it was

00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:29,130
a bunch of adults trying to recreate

00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,800
this vision of the path of the future

00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,940
the day had had it from their past and i

00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,370
went his other place where it was a

00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,020
bunch of kids learning from the past and

00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:41,100
then applying that to the future and

00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:44,520
those kids were a lot more hopeful and

00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:46,530
sound had much sounder judgment than the

00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,000
other version and i feel like that is

00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:50,670
the way it should be right we should

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,220
learn from our past and probably and we

00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:55,730
not from these futures that we thought

00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,730
was going to happen

00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,660
