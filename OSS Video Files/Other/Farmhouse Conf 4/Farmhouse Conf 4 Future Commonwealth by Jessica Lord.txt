my name is Jessica Ward and so before

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,219
DIY before I moved to California year

00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,660
ago actually I was an architect and

00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:18,849
urban designer for the city of Boston

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:23,140
and that's what I've done for most of my

00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:25,390
time but I was joking earlier and then I

00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,689
kind of realized it was true that I

00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,849
moved out here a year ago to do well

00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:34,540
here being California and not the east

00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:36,640
coast to do Code for America and it was

00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,590
my first time out here and it was a

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,300
total dive into the deep end of the tech

00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:44,110
world of the Bay Area and all this stuff

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:46,150
and since then with just like months

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,620
under my belt of programming like you

00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,810
know I gave talks and talked about

00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,390
projects and programming things but I'd

00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:55,630
spent way more time being an architect

00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,579
and urban designer but as I'm not 50 and

00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,560
a white male like I've never been asked

00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:04,269
to speak about city so this is the first

00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:08,439
time i've talked about cities um which i

00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:12,070
do care a lot about so that is the

00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,890
background um I've been torn about where

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,840
to start but my senior year in

00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,820
architecture of school was a study

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,340
abroad program and I had this professor

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,460
who totally shifted me from architecture

00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,500
into urban design and because one of the

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,659
things he challenged us to do was

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,090
measure the city with our body to go

00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:33,130
around and understand how spaces were

00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,040
working are not working and then make

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,530
notes and observations about how that

00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,180
how that space related to our body like

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,830
measure with your feet the side of the

00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,350
sidewalk that didn't work at the size of

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,000
the sidewalk that did work and he called

00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,490
that the rules of thumb and to sort to

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,680
be thinking about spaces that way and he

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:56,470
also said something that just burned in

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,290
my head and it is that every trip begins

00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:02,080
and ends with walking and so no matter

00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:05,200
kind of what technology we have or how

00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,270
technology change changes like whether

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,189
our cars drive on roads today or they

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,200
float in the air later like we have to

00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:14,230
walk to that car right so what happens

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,029
when our cities aren't designed for for

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,139
walking right which is the inevitable

00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:18,130
thing that we're always going to be

00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,780
doing at some

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,330
boy and especially what happens during

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,270
times when those technologies don't

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,040
exist like when gas goes away or becomes

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,080
too expensive to use if we don't have

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,550
our feet to fall back on what happens

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,040
when cities aren't designed basically

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,120
for people and so that's something I'm

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,390
always always thinking about and I

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,780
recently read a book by EO wilson who is

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,920
I guess a set scientist who he writes

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,630
about a lot of other things but he knows

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,820
a lot about ants and social creatures

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,910
but he wrote this awesome book called

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,610
the social conquest of Earth and as I

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:58,150
read it so many things sounded to me

00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:01,960
like cities and he talks about the

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:06,910
evolution of mankind but it sounded to

00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:09,250
me like cities and culture today and so

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,110
I'm embarking on this talk about the

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,880
future of cities knowing also that

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,270
everyone who talked about the future of

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,830
cities is wrong again everyone looks

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,090
back on those things and laughs because

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:26,140
it was ridiculous so I'll probably be

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:28,870
wrong but I will like those people be

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,360
optimistic and idealistic and what I say

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,650
but i think i will differ and that i

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,600
think a lot of predictions of the future

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,730
look at technology and they say what

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,530
technology might be possible and then

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,860
they mold what they predict our lives to

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,200
be around that technology and to me i

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,720
think the future will be more about

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,700
people and not technology and that the

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,100
future looks more like the past and sort

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:58,959
of what people in humans have always

00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:03,400
been and so in this book by EO wilson he

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,620
talks about how humans are this what we

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,050
are today the dominant species on earth

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,600
not because we had larger brains and

00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:13,180
could solve complex problems but because

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,090
we were social because ever since the

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,830
dawn of time we've been in small groups

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,109
of people and it's been essential to our

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:23,160
survival to be around people to be able

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:26,979
to read people and understand people and

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,410
manipulate people and try and guess what

00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:31,540
their intentions are and all of this has

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,900
led to the success of our evolution and

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,889
so

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:38,710
I think that that sort of core

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:43,740
humaneness will shape the future of

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,740
cities more than any specific technology

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:54,490
so I have some notes because I knew this

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,100
would happen so cities are places where

00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:00,250
we get to be with people right and so

00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,320
cities are the places that conjure up

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,590
all of these really really old and

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,900
traditional and forever inherent things

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,560
in us about being able to see people and

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:15,220
understand people cities put us in

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,320
subways and sidewalks with all kinds of

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,120
conditions of the human race we have an

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,210
understanding of what the human race is

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,180
like and cities make it really really

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:31,389
easy to transfer ideas and a lot of

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:33,789
ideas happen in cities and so for this

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,610
to be true those cities have to be four

00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:38,860
people and so I think you see this in a

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,020
lot of older cities right cities that

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,690
weren't designed around any particular

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,490
technology because maybe you know about

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,960
some cities that are designed around a

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:51,280
particular technology like the

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,370
automobile and so there is there's a

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,800
major difference there's another guy and

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,590
maybe I'm jumping around and sorry Kevin

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,580
Lynch who is my favorite urbanist but he

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,500
talks about how cities are every single

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,960
thing about a city is a human-made

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,409
decision and every human made decision

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,810
is connected to a value statement right

00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:16,180
because when you decide to build a

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,099
highway you're placing a value on the

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,599
need to move cars really really quickly

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:24,760
and so you can look at cities today and

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,650
derive from that like what were the

00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,750
values of that city

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:34,300
from the people making decisions in that

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:37,090
city and I think / hope that the future

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,780
of cities will be more about the value

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:48,160
in our humaneness and are needing to be

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:51,009
with people so and when you think about

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,539
cities that were started a long long

00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,610
time ago like they weren't built for

00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:57,460
technology they were built because at

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,500
some point we stopped moving on and we

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,979
started moving around in one place right

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,729
and we had to trade goods and make goods

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:08,440
and store Goods and defend goods and so

00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,789
cities were shaped by decisions based on

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,789
these type of things and

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:17,020
technology-enabled things but for a long

00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:19,680
time it didn't dictate what cities look

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,680
like and

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,830
and so basically in my prediction of the

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,840
future of cities it's going to be that

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,960
cities will be more about people and

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,170
technology will aid in that but it won't

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,030
dictate it because I hope that will get

00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,870
proven over and over that we can't

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:47,380
escape our humaneness and when you think

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:51,700
about things like smartphones now like

00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,260
if you are going to catch your bus you

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,850
know exactly when that bus is coming

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,680
because there's something in your hand

00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,900
that tells you the boss is about to come

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,930
but you could still actually miss that

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:06,400
bus unless someone on the bus sees you

00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:08,740
running for it empathizes and says stop

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,250
and wait for that person right and so in

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:15,010
so many cases it's really hard to

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,720
absolutely remove that human element

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:21,910
from the way we interact in cities and

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:25,350
so there are a lot of awesome people out

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:28,150
there who are trying to do just that

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:32,140
Enrique Pena losa was a former mayor of

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:36,010
Bogota and sort of a saint I think in

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:38,410
terms of championing people and he

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,570
speaks a lot about social justice in

00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:42,550
cities right that when you walk the

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,350
streets of your city you should not if

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,210
you are walking or riding a bike you

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,480
should feel just as valuable as the

00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:51,220
person who's driving a car and city

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:57,270
should be designed that way right with

00:08:51,220 --> 00:09:03,490
no one mode dominating over another and

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:05,440
I and he and other people use cities to

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,480
test ideas which is I think another

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,500
thing that cities have to continue to be

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:15,340
in the futures they have to be adaptable

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,380
so a building that was great for 18th

00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,250
century manufacturing needs to be great

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:23,230
for 21st century hydroponics right and

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,440
buildings that are designed for one

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:29,250
really specific use are the empty big

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,330
boxes and a lot of the suburbs now and

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,790
cities need to be places where we can

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,860
play with the space and do things like

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,870
broadway in new york city where they

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,820
changed all the lines in the road

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,350
and made a pedestrian space in the

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,839
middle of the road and they started it

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,880
saying it's going to be temporary right

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,700
and then it worked really great and then

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,120
you can keep it and that's that's

00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,140
something that needs to be done because

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,200
everything else takes a really really

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,250
long time to happen in space

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,339
unfortunately and it's really

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:12,190
frustrating but cities have to be

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:14,290
adaptable oh yeah so techno so

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,640
technology is going to continue to

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,800
evolve and we're going to continue to

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,250
have technology that will enable us to

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,810
do awesome things but going back to

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,170
never being able to strip ourselves from

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:29,230
our humaneness we actually don't need to

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,390
be the most efficient we can be and we

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:36,190
don't need to be automated all the time

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:38,860
um car are really wide roads and

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,290
highways are really efficient for cars

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,270
but they're scary for people to cross

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,540
they make the people inside the cars

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,100
really angry and you can actually be a

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,110
healthier and happier person if you're

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,360
not on that super efficient thing right

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,980
and if you are walking instead of

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,779
driving to dinner and you bump into

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,330
somebody or you see a poster for

00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:00,130
something there are all these tiny

00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,260
moments that can happen in your life

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,080
that can't happen otherwise and so it's

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,900
really beneficial to not be as efficient

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,390
as you could possibly be and with

00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,880
automation we have things like traffic

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,040
lights that are deciding for us when

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,110
it's okay to go and when it's not okay

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,670
to go and then we get really adjusted to

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,220
doing that and obeying the traffic

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:27,310
lights and what they say to do and there

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,529
are places in Europe and I'm going to

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:33,790
really butcher this name because i don't

00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:35,589
speak Dutch but it's Vanar but there are

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,690
places where they remove the traffic

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:41,620
lights they removed traffic signs and in

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:43,990
some cases they removed sidewalks and

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:48,610
there's no delineation between space and

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:50,240
so that removed it down to humans having

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,399
to interact with humans

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,290
to decide what was appropriate and it's

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,760
actually become immensely safer because

00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,830
humans are doing what humans are

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,330
actually really really really good at

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:07,850
which is being with people and so I

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,800
think that that will continue to be the

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:13,250
case that we will have technology that

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,080
changes and changes and changes but just

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,180
because we can do it doesn't always mean

00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,850
we need to do it will be able to build

00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,339
skyscrapers into the sky with carbon

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,589
fiber but then we'll be creating you

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:26,120
know vertical suburbs and that's not

00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:29,870
what we need to do and there's always

00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,470
going to be a happy medium of creating a

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:35,750
safe earthquake resistant space but that

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:39,860
also keeps the streets a really happy

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:42,529
place to be too and I also don't think

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,149
that the future will be all about cities

00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,279
i think sometimes the grand vision of

00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:49,640
the future is that we'll all live in

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:53,240
these giant new york city type of cities

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,970
and i think that that doesn't have to be

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,220
true and it's a great place for a great

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,899
for people during certain times of their

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,510
life when that makes sense for them but

00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:04,160
i think you can live outside the city

00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,430
and that can be a perfectly fine

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,100
sustainable place to live but what's

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:12,920
happened in the last like 50 years is

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,620
that everyone who moved to the suburbs

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,930
was still really dependent on the city

00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:21,110
for work for groceries for social

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:24,740
interaction and what will change is that

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:27,140
there will be this sliding scale of the

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,149
city is a pool of shared resources we

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,660
can share the way we get to work and we

00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:34,399
can share restaurants and we can share

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,070
whatever but the further you move from

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,760
the city the more you do yourself right

00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:42,589
you may have a few animals and some

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,170
crops and you don't need to go to the

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:47,360
city every day and you can probably work

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:51,020
from home because there's this thing

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,230
called the internet and the internet is

00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:58,370
going to be I think well it is whatever

00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:00,790
but the internet is awesome and it's

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,790
going to

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,950
alright i'll have another EO wilson

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:16,640
quote that i know i'm not going to say

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,350
right but this is from the same book the

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,590
social conquest of Earth but he talks

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,960
about how when anyone innovation is

00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,120
adopted it makes possible the next

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,920
adoption of the next innovation which

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,660
makes possible the next adoption and

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,170
then it happens faster and faster and

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,880
faster and then the groups that are able

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,060
to roll with this and accept these

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,680
changes are the ones that end up

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,720
dominating and the other groups are the

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,840
ones that either try to copy it or fall

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,050
behind and in that section he's actually

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,180
talking about a period in time 60,000 to

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:53,000
50,000 years ago and to me it was just

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,130
so remarkable how it sounded like my

00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,050
life in San Francisco and the last year

00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:02,420
and and I think that goes back to how

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:07,160
you can't remove you know what is human

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:09,650
about us and we're at this remarkable

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,610
time I think having spent some time in

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:17,990
city government and in san francisco now

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:19,610
where we have more capacity to do more

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:23,000
with information than our government

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,400
does and we can actually collect the

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,410
data make meaningful connections with it

00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,850
and visualize it more than our

00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,700
government can and that gives us an

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,590
immense power and we are that group

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,720
that's ready to adopt and ready to

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,430
change and that's seeing something and

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,760
innovating on that thing and then

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:42,410
innovating on the next thing and

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,700
government is the one that's behind and

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,740
that is becoming less relevant i think

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,720
and but i think that's incredible

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,450
because i think it gives the people this

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,410
incredible power to do things themselves

00:15:53,450 --> 00:16:00,470
and we now have I mean with crowdfunding

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,060
and just every social network we have

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,880
the capacity to organize ourselves

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,190
together to fun things together and to

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,300
actually just get together and build

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:14,770
things in real life and people want to

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:19,459
do that because people love people and

00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:21,519
so this last year that I've dove into

00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:25,220
all that is the San Francisco Bay Area

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,649
um a lot of my friends are nerds now and

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:31,339
which is fine and I'm a nerd or else I

00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:33,319
wouldn't be out here but they spend a

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:34,339
ton of time in front of computers and

00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:36,889
they're the people who are making

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:39,980
browsers as powerful as browsers have

00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,990
become rapidly right but they're also

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,999
this group of people that travels to

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,670
conferences more than any other group of

00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:48,679
people i know because as much as they

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,649
are computer geeks behind a computer so

00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:54,079
often like they love going to see people

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:56,050
and talking with other people and i just

00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:03,549
think it's amazing that we can't

00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:14,449
subtract this from our culture and so

00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:19,520
maybe finally oh yeah tagging on to that

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:21,799
open source so you have people creating

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,309
these innovations on top of innovations

00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:28,250
on top of innovations who love to fly to

00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,980
places and see other people and then a

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,140
lot of them are contributing to open

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,669
source if not exclusively and myself

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,559
included and it's this amazing I think

00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:42,049
sort of ideal that exists in our world

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,630
today where people are working together

00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:48,760
to build something better for everyone

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,870
and that's incredible like that's I

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,500
could I just want it in there if you

00:17:50,870 --> 00:18:00,409
like isn't that awesome um but I think

00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:03,350
it's also part that these last few

00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:05,390
generations we have a lot more leisure

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,640
time than maybe other generations have

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,679
and I think it's incredible that we in a

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,510
lot of ways choose to spend that free

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,809
time building open source things and

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:18,980
doing things together and so I think

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:22,610
that in the future cities will be made

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:25,190
more by the people valuing people and

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,779
technology will always have a role in it

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,270
because technology is always going to

00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:31,669
get better but technology will support

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,049
the things that enable us to be our most

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,169
human

00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,169
and

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,950
