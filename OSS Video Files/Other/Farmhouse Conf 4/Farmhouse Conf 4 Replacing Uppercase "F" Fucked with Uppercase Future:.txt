Description: 
	Replacing Uppercase "F" Fucked with Uppercase Future: Active Participation in Response by Willowbl00

Now that the beautiful promise of the internet has worn off, and we understand that it is not inherently equalizing, we can begin to realize our true roles as activists in closing social, economic, and opportunity gaps. The protocols we once thought were neutral are being used by established hierarchies to reenforce and strengthen their holds, to further detriments to the people at the bottom of those structures. willowbl00 will tell a story of hackerspaces and education, of technology in disaster response and civic voices, of tempered negotiations and paced arms races. With lots of examples of deployed initiatives, their downfalls and triumphs, this talk shows the future that is being built to prevent and amend continued atrocities. The future is here, but we have to fight to make it evenly distributed.

I'm will Abreu I have cared about

00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,809
transhumanism for a long time so it's

00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:15,519
nice to talk about a capital F future

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,840
it's really nice to trot out this part

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,020
of my brain that's been out to pasture

00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,090
for a long time I did transients

00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,310
discussion groups back in college I used

00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,470
to organize them and moderate them and

00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,670
and then I got kind of frustrated

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,109
because it was a bunch of privileged

00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,689
white kids sitting around a room talking

00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,850
about a future which is good it's better

00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:36,250
than just not thinking about it at all

00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,200
and not discussing it at all but I got

00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,940
kind of fed up with that and so then I

00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,170
discovered the hackerspace scene and

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,700
then it was a bunch of foolish kids

00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,280
white kids sitting around making a

00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,170
future was like yes progress we're doing

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,140
things we're learning how to do how to

00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,550
build how to teach each other and then

00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,840
even that was a little bit too insular

00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,059
for me and there was this whole thing

00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,800
like noisebridge that Jake knows about

00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:59,410
obviously and a bunch of other people

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,789
and started a similar one up in Seattle

00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,379
called jigsaw renaissance which was

00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,660
about being extroverted and about

00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:07,240
teaching new people how to do these new

00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,940
things and it was very entrenched in the

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,849
idea of where do you think these people

00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,979
come from we are not Athena springing

00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:18,729
out of the forehead of Zeus fully formed

00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:20,890
capable of programming and soldering we

00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:24,520
have to learn we have to we have to

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,610
teach the kids think of the children so

00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,709
then I got into digital humanitarian

00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:33,849
response which is people with technical

00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:35,739
skill sets figuring out how to this is

00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:37,209
really distracting it's great music but

00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:39,459
it's going to take me just a little bit

00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:42,970
so I'm going to slow down sorry for

00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:45,429
being so explicit and so then I started

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,020
thinking about how people with technical

00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:49,770
skill sets get involved with

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,810
humanitarian aid and disaster response

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,520
because we will promise this amazing

00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,429
future of the internet it was going to

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,709
be the great equalizer technology was

00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:01,209
supposed to be totally neutral anyone

00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:04,840
could pick it up and it would make us

00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:07,929
all partners in the world right and

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,390
instead it gave us just one more gap to

00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:12,280
overcome now we're not just looking at

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,260
economic issues now we're not just

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,730
looking about where resources are

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,130
located and how we're treating each

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,380
other now we also have issues of who can

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,810
use tech who has access to it where is

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:26,460
connectivity happening everybody with me

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:29,560
so far okay so I started carrying about

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,010
disaster response and what tools we use

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,960
and then what we can leave in an area

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:38,800
for that population to be able to be

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,470
better empowered in the future because

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,580
right now how we do response is we show

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:48,010
up in capes like we know what is best

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,840
for this community we will deploy a

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,430
program and then leave and then you end

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,630
up with cargo cults right where people

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,070
don't understand what happened they just

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,360
understand that help is coming and then

00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,870
they don't know how to help themselves

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,420
and we think we're [ __ ] up the world

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,730
even more than it already was but with

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,380
digital response you have people with

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,480
technical skill sets who want to be able

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,310
to help somehow that's how we regain

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,730
control of our world or at least some

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,570
semblance of control is through creation

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:18,430
with the skill sets that we have and so

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,530
let's see I'll give you a concrete

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:27,190
example because that's the best thing

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:30,700
ever right so for sandy when that came

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,430
in um I had very strange honor of

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,680
deploying with phemus innovation group

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,050
FEMA has an innovation group and they

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,910
figured out how much they messed up in

00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,580
Katrina they're like we should probably

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,350
not be at least that bad which try to

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,930
figure out how to do this and so they

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:50,740
call in someone like me and I dressed

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,540
this way all of the time I to help them

00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,370
deploy and to figure out what's going on

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,180
and the first thing that we talked to

00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,040
them about was who is your end user who

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,260
are you here to certainly oh the first

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,180
responder is like that we set up we set

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,550
up Wi-Fi networks people can get on it

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,920
okay who who's connecting like what's

00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,360
what's how many users can you have on

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,459
this wireless access point like well

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:18,190
it's the NYPD they're not your end user

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,840
like whoa then who is it the affected

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,470
population like the people who live here

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,360
if you give them the platform on which

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,550
they can connect to each other they'll

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,470
take care of most of their [ __ ] on their

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,160
own you just have to get out of their

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,520
way

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,780
and then you bring in the big guns of

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,890
massive resources as far as money and

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,600
that's basically what they brought this

00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,390
time and it ended up pretty well right

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:48,040
got it yeah there's still a lot going

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:49,360
wrong but so we did things with disaster

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,430
recovery centers and a lot of this has

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
to do around design not just around

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,820
technology so there's there are these

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,590
disaster recovery centers which is where

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,070
FEMA and the Red Cross find a place with

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:05,290
a big parking lot usually a a Walmart or

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,910
some such they set up all of their

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,010
trailers people come in and they stand

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,780
in line for at least an hour and then

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,360
they sit on a phone for at least 45

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,670
minutes with a 45-percent with a forty

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,290
percent drop rate to talk to someone on

00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,030
the other end of the line who's filling

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,380
out a form for them to go into a

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,400
database to figure out if they get

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,410
funding from the house that sounds awful

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,730
right it used to be you would fill out a

00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,800
form and mail it in and you would hear

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:33,700
back in a couple weeks so improvements

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,720
but they're still asking people to so so

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,460
that's where they're asking people to

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,750
come and that's because they can set up

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,330
their big trucks and everything else

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,220
what people do on their own is go to

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,380
areas that they already know well they

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,090
go to high schools and churches and they

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,950
set up where they already have a sense

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,480
of community and then they help each

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,980
other out there they grill out it it's

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,800
great and you know considering the

00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,590
circumstances so what we did was bring

00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,870
in satellite uplinks to the places where

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:03,490
people already were and we got iPads I

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,190
lobbied for Android devices or whatever

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,020
else but I can only do so much and and

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,610
then you have people who are certified

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,810
fill out the forms with someone so

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,360
they're standing there talking to them

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,190
as a person and it's great well the

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,930
person's phone is charging over here

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,770
because you have a generator set up so

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,900
they're already going to be standing

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,700
around anyway and then you have them

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,740
fill out the form and then it can

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,200
asynchronously upload when it can and

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,120
soon we'll also be able to do a direct

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,110
deposit into someone's bake account and

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,560
they can just take care of what they

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:36,100
need to so progress is being made but as

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,110
an earlier gentleman pointed out the

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,200
tech is just amplifying what the human

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,700
intent is and right now we're having to

00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,970
teach these arcane in

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,230
tutions how to do things better and

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,720
luckily some of them want to do it

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,840
better and going back to another talk of

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,900
the music industry FEMA is essentially

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,130
the record label right now right there

00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,840
are all these people want to figure out

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,340
how to connect to each other and provide

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,370
each other resources they want to do

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,990
micro lending and they wanted I go in

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,690
and help with their hands and they want

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,580
to do whatever they can but FEMA right

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,080
now is getting in the way and they're

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,140
working on getting out of the way and

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,760
what i was talking to them about an

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,610
awful lot was that we mean their

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,110
institutional knowledge they know that

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,050
there are some things that you just

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,170
don't do in disaster because it's a bad

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,790
idea from past experience we need their

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,350
institutional knowledge and we do need

00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,450
to systematize some of the ways that we

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,380
do things but we need to do so in a way

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:37,660
that it's self examining in that process

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,670
does that make sense cool sorry i'm not

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,990
actually used to talking for this long

00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,960
and I'm used to doing a lot of like

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,700
hackathons and on conferences and and so

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,320
that I'm just standing here talking to

00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,320
you is you're really [ __ ] weird for

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,240
me so I'm gonna look at my notes and if

00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,520
anyone has questions at any point you

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,520
should tell me and shout them out i

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,710
defined transhumanism as the evolution

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,330
of humanity through technology there are

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:13,660
all sorts of other definitions for it

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:16,230
I'm so posthumanism post-humans being no

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,940
longer human being either because of

00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,940
genetic modification to a degree that we

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:26,200
are in a different species or because we

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:28,090
have left the biological I think it will

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,790
be some combination thereof but so

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,680
that's the end point that's the next

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,390
state the transition period is

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,490
transhumanism it's on the way of being

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,490
getting there so make sense pretty good

00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:53,120
okay so i'll give you another example of

00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,600
how this went really well there's is it

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,530
this leaf i think it's this one um

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,210
there's a group called digital democracy

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:06,560
and most of what i do our hackathons is

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:08,990
it is it ok ok so there's a group called

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,330
digital democracy and this is complete

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:15,290
change and we're not talking about

00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:17,090
hurricanes anymore at least for now dear

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,120
humanity and global climate change and

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,940
everything else um so there's a group

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,770
called cove aviv in port-au-prince which

00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,050
is coalition of victims for victims and

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:30,400
it's founded by these women who have

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:33,080
histories of rape forming safe space for

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,340
for victims of gender-based violence so

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,190
that they can get the resources they

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:40,040
need it be eight counselors or medical

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,010
or lawyers or whatever else shelter etc

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:50,080
now they're teamed up with UNICEF yes

00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:50,080
which is awesome and so huh ok cool

00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:59,589
so what whoa so what's happened in the

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,420
past is they used to go out after the

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:02,980
earthquake to talk to people and they

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,269
were just present in the neighborhood

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,139
and people knew how to find them then as

00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,149
more and more people needed their

00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,369
services they set up a call center and a

00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:14,339
shelter so that people could call in 24

00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:17,290
hours a day which is unprecedented and

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,359
it's free and so it's not just people

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,579
calling in to report but people also

00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:23,230
calling in to ask questions like my

00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,999
girlfriend is super young she's below

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,319
the age of consent but I really like her

00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,089
and what should i do and so they have

00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:29,980
these great conversations they have

00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,339
staff they have a database tracking all

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,799
the people that are coming in that are

00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:38,169
affected in awful ways and now it's

00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:40,829
gained enough traction that people are

00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:43,359
calling from outside port-au-prince and

00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:46,119
all the knowledge is stored in their

00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:47,829
head of where these places are all these

00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:52,089
resources of the counselors and the

00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:55,569
lawyers and the doctors and so we help

00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:56,889
them build a database that was on urban

00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:58,449
street map which is a layer does

00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,549
everybody know about openstreetmap it's

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:04,089
wiki for maps it's amazing you should

00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:06,399
use it um and it's also great because

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,439
you can refer to the same area by

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,999
different terms that's why it's useful

00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:13,179
as a wiki because there aren't really

00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:15,220
any addresses in Haiti and so most

00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:16,989
people will refer to it as well where

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,730
this camp used to be or it's next to the

00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:20,470
old hospital or whatever else and so you

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,509
have someone type it in all the

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,029
resources although locations are listed

00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:26,739
on a private database because they can't

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,429
be accessible to the public because that

00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:33,160
would be bad news bears and so now they

00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:34,869
can search it but the thing that was

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,910
interesting about our methodology was

00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:39,369
that while we brought I think was six

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,199
international people on the team we

00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:43,929
worked with a local technical college

00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:46,239
called SE and the women who worked at

00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:48,759
cove aviv and so the women designed

00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:52,209
their own interface and we had all these

00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:54,489
great translators and we didn't build on

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:55,809
the platforms that the people from the

00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:57,730
international team were comfortable with

00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:59,049
we built with the platforms that the

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,149
kids at the Technical College were

00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:02,889
comfortable with and what was the most

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:03,590
beautiful thing to see you is that at

00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,420
the beginning

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,400
we had to keep pulling people up and it

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,870
was like one person who speaks in

00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,730
English is fine to present but we also

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,380
need someone from who speaks Creole to

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,580
come up and present every single time

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,810
and it's pulling teeth and it's pulling

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,310
to you than it's pulling teeth but

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,920
what's great is that when people have an

00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:22,040
urgent project to focus on they forget

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,470
to be awkward it's my favorite thing and

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,240
so by the end of it they didn't need us

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,830
anymore they're like we built this in

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,080
this platform don't even remember what

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,750
it was was some JavaScript based thing I

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,540
think maybe I don't actually program i

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,250
just talked to people who do and we were

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,390
so excited about the things that they

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,860
were building that they were standing up

00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,660
and talking about it and the women were

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,850
really excited and like drawing out the

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,160
different interfaces and me we had

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,230
crayons because crayons are amazing and

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,270
we built out this whole thing and at the

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,360
end of the weekend what could have been

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:57,260
a very simple project was suddenly maybe

00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,020
less eloquent in deployment but was

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:02,270
built by the people there and we were

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,650
able to just get out of the way we

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:07,670
weren't needed at the end of it which

00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:10,550
was [ __ ] victory right so to me what

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:14,240
this is is people regaining what that

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:16,370
promise of internet was we have to do

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,850
the outreach thing of teaching people

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,680
how to use and also getting out of the

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,750
way once they figure out what they want

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,950
to do with it we can't constantly be

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,330
like well that's not how it's done

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,220
because it's done this way or I know

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,840
that it's done this way let people play

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:37,820
let people figure out how they want to

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:40,250
do it and more notes okay so in all this

00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,810
stuff that well I'll tell you more about

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,550
the stuff that I do and then I'll tell

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,910
you about my deepest personal conflict

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:51,440
and then I'll probably wander away and

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,750
dance okay so the things that I do geek

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,170
to that bounds we do a lot of hackathons

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,510
with disaster and humanitarian response

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,130
and we do them in an international scale

00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,680
because it's my favorite thing ever to

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,830
give a bunch of problem definitions to

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,780
geeks across the globe and if they can't

00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,910
figure out how to collaborate across

00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,380
cities when we know that we're going to

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,290
have an event how do they think they're

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,850
going to do it in times of disaster and

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,190
ability

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,920
it would be perfect people will use it

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:24,130
to respond and no the figure out where

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,130
the gas stations are in in New York

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,079
right you can build a map on an existing

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,819
platform but building a new tour when

00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:32,769
everything is on fire is a terrible idea

00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:34,870
because it's not just about you building

00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,940
it it's also about people learning about

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,589
it and them learning how to use it and

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,670
then telling other people so we have to

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:45,100
kind of have a continual involvement in

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,779
this cycle and we have to use another

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,620
opportunity of how we connect to our

00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,819
world so we do that we also do six

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,529
months of mentorship for the most

00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:55,630
promising of those teams so that they

00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:58,750
can actually deploy the thing that

00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:01,079
they're building and does that make

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:04,829
sense am I using too many vague words I

00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:08,350
can't tell everyone looks thoughtful

00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:11,529
okay cool sorry this is so weird I feel

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:13,060
like a like a cat with a mouse that ends

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:20,199
up being a toy and you're like I thought

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:24,009
it was gonna move okay um sorry boxing a

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:26,199
glacier I think the term um so that's

00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:28,829
what we do there and the other thing I'm

00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:31,540
doing right now is studying how

00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:33,910
distributed groups scale in a social

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,829
sense and I get to do this at the center

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,930
of Pacific media out of the MIT Media

00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,910
Lab and I have the honor of working with

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,490
ethan Zuckerman who is amazing has been

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,050
doing digital activism for like before

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:48,040
we knew what the internet was I don't

00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:49,839
know he's brilliant but because I'm

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,970
tired of the things that I love being

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,670
crushed under their own weight as they

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,439
gain traction we we seem to think that

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,959
the tech is where it's at and it's about

00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:01,990
how we relate to each other as people as

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,579
facilitated by the tech and we need to

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,899
start paying more attention to that but

00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,639
that's also because I'm a sociologist

00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:12,339
and that's what I think everything

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:15,639
relies upon so what all of this goes to

00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:18,449
for me is the the daily struggle that I

00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:21,850
deal with in how we build the future is

00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:26,380
I really like setting things on fire

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:28,600
right I want I want that big capital our

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,680
revolution that leads to our capital F

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,980
future

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,960
but the more I deal with response and

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,660
the more I realize how many people are

00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,790
already living awful lives and are

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,350
barely getting by the more I realized

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,020
that that sort of thing is not going to

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:46,209
leave us in any better situation like I

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,310
really hope that it would but the more I

00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:51,910
read about revolution and the more that

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:54,850
I still desire it one of my friends once

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,620
said that after any revolution you end

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:01,330
up with the same system just fewer

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:03,700
public services because we're not we're

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,740
not creating the change in our social

00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,750
situation that would lead us to have

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,209
better leaders or for us to be our

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,540
leaders we just tear down what exists

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:16,179
and then something else merges up and so

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:19,500
having to work with groups like FEMA it

00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:21,370
which is full of good people um and

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,100
figuring out how to interact with the

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:26,770
Red Cross and getting invited to the

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,440
White House where they checked my three

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:33,330
forms of my ID and no one else is in the

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,250
group which is happy fun times um is

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:40,650
that moving a system like that is

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:43,360
excruciating and it means making some

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,820
concessions and trying to figure out how

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,530
to like which are worth making and which

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,940
are absolutely not and it takes a lot of

00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:57,580
strength from within which I am finally

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:59,880
figuring out in my late 20s and one of

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,280
the only reasons why I feel ok with

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,809
standing where I do is that there are

00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,670
incredible and powerful people also

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:09,580
working on tearing down our current

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:11,530
system and there are incredible and

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,710
brilliant people working on building up

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,809
new systems like alternatives and so I

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:21,280
feel okay balancing out where we are

00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:24,220
right now in causing the least damage as

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,270
possible as this thing fails does that

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:30,280
make sense ok so that's the future that

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,360
I am working on building and I'm glad

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,860
that there are so many people

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,170
approaching it from so many different

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,270
perspectives and I think that it is

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:41,760
vital that we continue to call each

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,760
other on our problems in I

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:49,270
in loving and growing ways and it's the

00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:52,510
responsibility of each of us in how we

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:57,690
build our future and to not leave other

00:18:52,510 --> 00:19:01,330
people in the dust while we build it in

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:03,100
building things in port-au-prince it was

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,900
my favorite thing that the internet kept

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,460
giving out because it meant that all the

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,900
libraries that people wanted to pull in

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,510
all the fancy [ __ ] they wanted to build

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,150
they couldn't I was like this is how the

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:18,520
internet works here okay I was trying to

00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:22,480
run all sorts of anyway when you're only

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,340
getting so many bits a second you don't

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,950
care about looking up the page that you

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,250
were looking up anyway like you forget

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:33,549
to care and so you your curiosity in the

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,990
world and your desire to find anything

00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,940
interesting it suddenly makes sense how

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,419
you can just throttle the tubes on

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,880
certain topics for pages like they do in

00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,500
in certain countries because you just

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,700
you get fed up and you're used to the

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,830
internet being slow anyway and you're

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,270
like you would okay I'll just go look at

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:54,280
facebook instead or I'll go look at

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:56,140
whatever else instead um so yes both

00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,030
things that keep your end user in mind

00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,799
not just the people that you think might

00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,500
end up being your end user that make

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,910
sense cool that's all I've got to say

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,910
unless people have questions

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,850
