avocado fall in their head is that is

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,360
that happen in past farmhouse

00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,390

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,460

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,960
first speaker to have that happen so if

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,880

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,950
out of the way um there's a line in this

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,290
american life that i like to adopt i'm

00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,780
gonna open with it's just I appreciate

00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:38,420
you all in advance for letting me talk

00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:40,670
here today I was a very sensitive child

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,250
and when I say it was a sensitive child

00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,570
I don't mean that I was scared at the

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,950
vacuum cleaner that went around the

00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,140
bottom of our pool and ate up all the

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,840
leaves and if it accidentally grazed my

00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,280
leg I would cry and I don't mean that I

00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,650
was a sensitive child that as a young

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,960
vegetarian when a boy in my kindergarten

00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,090
class took a piece of lunch me to put it

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,649
on my sandwich I refuse to eat lunch in

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,119
the cafeteria for a year I mean I was a

00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:07,430
sensitive child that I still remember

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,049
being eight years old being in the store

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,100
with my mom and hearing over the store

00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:15,170
radio the song Bohemian Rhapsody and

00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,450
just hearing the lyric I don't want to

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,840
die sometimes wish I'd never been born

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:24,709
at all was so upsetting to me that I was

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,929
blue for an entire afternoon my poor

00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:31,549
parents had given birth to a healthy

00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:36,590
girl with ten fingers ten toes and the

00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:38,509
ability to just deal to just deal with

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,600
life to deal with all her emotions just

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,729
none and being the good parents that

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,569
they were they were constantly trying to

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:50,779
construct rituals are ways to kind of

00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:53,959
help me deal which is why for example

00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:57,020
and I am NOT making this up every night

00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:59,149
for an entire year before I went to bed

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,149
I don't have to stand before one of my

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:06,289
parents raise my right hand and say out

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:07,680
loud I promise not to have any bad

00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:12,720
dreams tonight

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,400
because they're so silly why because I

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,760
saw the movie beetlejuice and it

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,940
traumatized me okay have all the things

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,160
that my parents kind of came up with to

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,810
help their sensitive child but they may

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,260
actually help the most was hearing my

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,780
dad start a sentence with Erica didn't

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,610
ever tell you about the time and I'd

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,140
loved this this meant that my dad was

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,480
going to go into a story about something

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,660
had happened to him and that he came out

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,580
the other end and everything was ok man

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,680
hidden somewhere in that story was going

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,239
to be a nugget a take away something

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,530
that wasn't necessary gonna lighten the

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,930
load for whatever or as I was going

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,480
through I'm just gonna help me carry it

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,790
a little bit better and that's why I

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,650
became a storyteller not because I've

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,260
lived this very adventurous wild

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,670
exciting life i have not but because as

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,040
I got older I started helping myself

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,800
deal when I would come out the other end

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,750
and I figured out that take away I had

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,459
that nugget I had that little thing I

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,530
thought there's probably someone else

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,690
out there that needs to hear this and

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,910
that's really why I'm here today I like

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,040
making people feel better and that's my

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,790
goal from this entire talk it's just to

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,140
make you feel better about the future

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,400
now the very mature day there are two

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,500
things I had to figure out how to deal

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,510
with the first was that I did not feel

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,180
very qualified to talk about the future

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,400
I had no idea why I was invited here in

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,230
the first place I am NOT a tech person I

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,930
am on the cutting edge of any technology

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,000
I am embarrassed to tell you what

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,650
operating system my iphone4 is that

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,190
right now because I refuse to update it

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,540
um I and I have an event am on an

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,030
Avenger I mean come over then a new

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,160
gives morning I can't figure out how to

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,810
put a fitted sheet on my mattress the

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:59,280
right way the first time I'm serious but

00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:04,049
what it is it is a very difficult thing

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,470
to do so but then I Fliss it to myself

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:09,870
Erica you know you know less qualified

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,140
than anybody else it's the future it

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,329
hasn't happened yet and then I felt

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,739
better the second thing I had to deal

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,170
with was a little bit more difficult and

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:22,620
I was just thinking about my future

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:26,940
itself cuz I'm gonna be honest with you

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,850
guys I kind of thought I'd be there by

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,920
now relationship wise career wise

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,660
whatever there are certain things in my

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,950
life that I kind of thought would have

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,110
happened by now and I was forced to kind

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,720
of figure out how do you think about a

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,650
future that should have already taken

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,390
place how do you imagine something that

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,430
you hope will happen that you also

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,940
thought would have already happened by

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,470
now and maybe part of this whole

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,720
introspection thing has to the fact that

00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,490
I just turned 31 this week I just

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,410
celebrated a birthday and I think that's

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,030
that's a time for a lot of people where

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,310
you take out that measuring stick and

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,980
kind of see how far you've come in that

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,810
year and I'm sure some of you already

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,170
know turning 31 is far more

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,660
anti-climactic than turning 30 if life

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,380
is a rollercoaster right being a kid is

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,960
like oh my gosh I'm just tall enough to

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,220
do something I being at the front of the

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,630
line is there anything more exciting

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,550
your kid they're just being at the front

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,580
of the line and like strapping yourself

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,530
into something that's gonna go somewhere

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:36,210
your chains in your 20s that is the

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:38,700
initial climb you're like wow I'm going

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,490
somewhere I'm moving up in the world

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:44,900
look at all that I can see you from down

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:50,730
here and at some point it'll 822 realize

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:55,790
 this isn't going to last forever at

00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:59,040
29 you are peering over that drop in 30

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:01,020
that's the descent everything after that

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,730
the loops the bumps a twist whatever it

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,010
is you're going through it's never

00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:09,690
Indians jarring because it's all carried

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:11,010
by that momentum now in real life when I

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,830
get off a rollercoaster you know they

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,720
sell those souvenir photos or snap at

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,940
that really awkward moment on the ride I

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,280
am NOT someone who ever needs to look at

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,310
them or needs to purchase them the

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,980
people who

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,840
the photos look like this or they have

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,030
something like plans they like toward

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,350
the right time that is never me my photo

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,570
always comes out looking like this I am

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,120
fighting it with everything I have I

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,670
can't damn this inflation my stomach

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,470
drop you I don't like it and over the

00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,760
years as I've gotten older just like

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,250
with other things like I'm like you know

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,290
it I'm into a lot of things I'm not into

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,150
that you know what no I don't need to go

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,530
on splash mountain only right over here

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,090
I'll seem to come out the other side no

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,660
I'm sure it's fine i just don't need to

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,940
do that but and it's funny as everyone

00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,760
else here today has brought up famous

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,340
quotes from books they read it i'm gonna

00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,470
put my favorite movie because that's me

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,200
um there's a quote from my favorite

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,840
movie of all time which is Parenthood

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,610
and in the movie steve martin and mary

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,680
steenburgen they play husband and wife

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:19,030
and they're having an argument and the

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,130
grandma walks in and she says when i was

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:27,850
19 your grandfather took me on a roller

00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:29,200
coaster up down up down what a ride you

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,270
know it was so amazing to me that

00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:36,970
somebody could be so scary so

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:40,900
frightening so exciting so so sickening

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,360
all at once some didn't like it they

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:47,500
went on to marry go round but that just

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:51,070
goes around nothing I like the roller

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,960
coaster you get more out of it and if

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,960
I'm honest with myself and with you guys

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,970
I think part of the reason I've

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,530
struggled to kind of think about my

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,830
future or maybe part of the reason why I

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,300
felt like I should be there right now

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,770
it's because the last couple years I've

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:11,560
been on the merry-go-round heartbreaker

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,840
clear whatever I think I kind of looked

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,030
at life and said you know what I'm gonna

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,640
go over here for a while I'm gonna call

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,370
a timeout and I'll see you when I'm when

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,990
I'm ready but over the last year ship

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:27,610
has been taking place for me and I feel

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:29,410
like it's time for me to get back on it

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,330
all started about a year ago when I got

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,940
a call from my sister with some very

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,120
exciting news she said

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,580
I get to take a +1 on this

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,070
all-expense-paid vegan holistic

00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,090
Caribbean cruise do you want to come now

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,340
anybody else in the right mind would

00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:50,590
have said I got the vacation days I'm

00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:55,350
booking a flight now yes i'm in end of

00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:59,080
story but i'm not everybody else i said

00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,280
hmm did you wanna did you want to take

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,600

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,010
does mom I go you don't let me sleep on

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,510
it you only see one I'll get back to you

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,000
let me let me think it over i'll get

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,590
back to morning let me sleep on it

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,260
because that is how I've made every

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:15,490
major decision in my life from about the

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:21,240
time I was 18 nati decided to go to UM

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:24,880
to NYU and when I got there I wasn't

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,540
very happy which is kind of probably an

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,460
understatement did I start looking for

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:34,750
schools to transfer to die start filling

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:37,600
at transfer applications no I just

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,270
thought about it and pondered it and

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,410
thought about it some more until one day

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:47,050
I woke up and I had graduated a short

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,750
time later I am I felt like it was time

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,940
for me to move to LA and the moment I

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,590
moved here and I got settled in suddenly

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:58,150
all of my childhood and high school

00:09:53,590 --> 00:10:00,550
friends moved to New York did I look for

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:03,850
a job in New York did I look for an

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,340
apartment in New York no I just thought

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,650
about it and I thought about it and I

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,470
thought about some more and this june i

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,800
will have been in it been in LA for

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,240
eight years what finally made me decide

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,030
to say yes to going on this cruise was

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,280
that i was in need of a new story and i

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:24,450
thought were else was I gonna find a

00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,070
good story but I built with 1,300

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,010
birkenstock wearing ponytail having

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,270
veggie loving yoga doing people and I

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,890
can say this affectionately because I

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,680
love yoga and I'm a vegetarian so I can

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,720
make fun of my own um and this was only

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,280
confirmed when I got the itinerary for

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,140
the cruise which is full of the silliest

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,050
sounding classes I'd ever heard heard of

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,529
like flower essences and a seminar

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,149
called straight bowels

00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:53,230
I'm not making that up couldn't make it

00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,910
ever tried and then the menu oh my god I

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,629
mean I'm from I live in LA but it was

00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:02,290
like vegan gluten-free vegan oil free

00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:04,839
gluten free vegan vegan as prescribed by

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,949
your macrobiotic practitioner and I

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,369
looked at my store and I said if these

00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:11,559
people think i'm eating miso soup for

00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:15,819
breakfast I'm gonna throw myself

00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:18,160
overboard Judy's on the boat and I am

00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:20,160
slipping out miso soup for breakfast

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,379
like it if maple syrup on pancakes

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,739
because I feel better than I have felt

00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:29,679
in years and the class is that I'm so

00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:32,019
ready to make fun of their I was 9am on

00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:35,439
the Lido deck scoop it up imaginary

00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:38,139
water to clear out my kidneys I guess in

00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:39,790
chi gong class and even though i joke to

00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,919
my sister she walked into the straight

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,189
bowel talk seminar that was probably

00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,169
going to be a load of crap it was

00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:48,669
riveting it was fascinating and the

00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:50,709
people that are is ready to make fun of

00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:53,109
they're just lovely kale loving people

00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,399
and if brother was wonderful view from

00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:55,749
Auburn was wonderful reports were

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,169
wonderful and the services wonderful

00:11:55,749 --> 00:12:04,839
which meant that I had no story so one

00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:06,189
night mr. so a night my sister says to

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,660
me hey let's kill some time before the

00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:13,509
vegan ice cream social and and let's go

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,569
to the casino and I said fine because I

00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:17,859
am not now nor have I ever been just I'm

00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,029
not looking at cars in every one big

00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:21,039
when I can but I was like fine we'll

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,679
just go and we sit down the blackjack

00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,889
table and I'm sandwich between my sister

00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,359
and an older gentleman and the dealer

00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:31,779
said scale out the cards and wouldn't

00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:34,480
you know it as usual I get dealt a 15

00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,989
and I can see the dealer has an eight

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,109
showing which means I've got a decision

00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:44,709
to make I look at the guy next to me and

00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:46,209
I'm like 110 and me says well if you're

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,579
playing by the book you've got to assume

00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:50,410
that the viewers got a 10 under there

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:53,230
they've got 18 and in order to beat that

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,990
you're gonna have to hit and I start

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,589
pondering

00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,410
but if I had I could go over there we go

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:03,270
by the book mm-hmm-hmm the valley just

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,529
go no I'll stay and my sister because

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,779
she's only looking at cards is a good

00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:11,190
man sir she stays do flips over his

00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:14,459
cards he's got 14 he's got a hit yells

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:16,670
out the next card he gets a 7 21

00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:19,680
blackjack there goes my five dollar chip

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:22,470
and if the dealer scooped up the cards

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,290
my mind started going to that spiral of

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,660
hmm Erykah seeing this is why people

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,160
playing by the book oh you know maybe if

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,690
you would have sided another table you

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,610
would have been looking oh maybe gonna

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:38,640
and I noticed something there aren't

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,170
very many other instances in life other

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,050
than blackjack when you can see the

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:48,180
immediate result of the decision you

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:50,310
didn't make right so if I had taken that

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,740
hit like I was supposed to by taking

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,440
that seven I would have had 22 I would

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:59,850
have gone bust no matter what i did that

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:04,110
hand I was going to loose and this hit

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,940
me so hard for my entire 20s i berated

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,820
myself I second-guess myself I made

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,980
myself crazy and maybe of those

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,140
crossroads in my life right invited

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,839
everybody I knew the way in I slept on a

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,270
night for separated maybe no matter what

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,190
i did i was just gonna push I was just

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:24,329
gonna go bust maybe it just wasn't in

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,620
the cards for me my great grandma was

00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,899
with who I'm actually named after my dad

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,510
said the cheese to say that the best way

00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:33,690
to never make a mistake is to stay home

00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:36,209
and do nothing and every decision you

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:39,779
make in life in its own way is a bit of

00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:41,130
a gamble but sitting there in Middle the

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,740
Caribbean ocean with some Romanian

00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,990
blackjack dealer I finally laid to rest

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,970
every decision i had made in my 20s I

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,740
like to tell you that after had that

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,959
major revelation I then went on to

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,940
finally win really big in the casino but

00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,130
now i'm still not want a car that won't

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,620
super money started with but to be able

00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,560
to make that piece of myself it was

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,240
worth the price of admission so great

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,400
now I had made peace with those

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,279
decisions and now it's time for me to

00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,930
really face

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,730
where those decisions or the paralysis

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,370
and not being able to make a decision

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,149
where that brought me and when I finally

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:20,139
took a look around I surveyed the land I

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:23,860
got this really sinking feeling that I

00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:26,470
was behind in life but how could I know

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,990
for sure I mean if only there is a place

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,939
where I could see how I measured up with

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,420
everybody else I had ever met in my

00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:38,139
entire life luckily that place does

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:41,110
exist it's called Facebook now I like to

00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:43,180
say that Facebook is created for people

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,410
who always assumed that everybody else

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,899
is off somewhere having a much better

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:52,509
time but never had any proof but it's

00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:54,189
awesome my rides here I gotta go um but

00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:56,379
it's also a really great way to compare

00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:57,699
yourself and I think it is really

00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:59,709
important in this day and age with

00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:02,800
technology and things being our

00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:05,050
perception of time being completely

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,029
warped that it's important to take a

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,059
moment every year and kind of see where

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:12,160
that year brought you because when

00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:15,759
technology in the mix yes time is

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,829
relative but forever can feel like they

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,269
met at the 30-second ad you up for

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:21,670
watching for a three minute before three

00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,050
minute YouTube video forever is that

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,459
feeling of trying to download an

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,040
attachment you're getting really shitty

00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:28,029
Wi-Fi so it's really really easy to

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,040
forget that when you're in the middle of

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:36,389
a part of your life that feels shitty

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:38,889
said it's just gonna go on forever now I

00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:41,230
finally took a step back around this

00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:46,899
point of my life and I noticed something

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:49,389
I was comparing my timeline on facebook

00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:51,370
with someone else's but if I were to

00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:53,529
really stretch it out and not just look

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:58,300
at it on the page by was to extend that

00:16:53,529 --> 00:17:00,939
timeline well into the future it's kind

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:04,419
of too soon to tell whether that person

00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:08,289
is a hater on behind it's too early in

00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:09,850
the game and so I think because we've

00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:11,709
been living this very voyeuristic live

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,959
for the last eight or nine years it's

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:16,120
very easy to forget that you're seeing

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,199
what looks like somebody's happily ever

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,350
after

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,809
really it's just one page in one chapter

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,039
and suddenly I found myself you know

00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:26,199
like clicking through like a dude

00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:32,399
someone's wedding album and instead of

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:35,740
being like oh hmm i'm behind him life

00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:38,010
and i didn't make the right decisions i

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:43,779
could see it for what it really was a

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:46,960
beautiful first wedding it doesn't mean

00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:48,610
it's gonna be their last and i started

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,929
applying this to other things in my life

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,490
you know I'd go on a date with a guy I

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,620
seem nice and charming but is he gonna

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,769
be the next mr. erika brooks attic minh

00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,490
i don't know too soon to tell

00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:59,320
politicians want to know if I'm better

00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,980
off now than I was four years ago I

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,590
don't know too soon to tell I don't know

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,090
what it is about experience and time and

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,950
age where all of a sudden the things

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,769
your parents told you a hundred times

00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,330
over finally starts to sink in but I

00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:16,210
finally got my dad was saying used to

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:19,029
tell me all the time you sit Erika life

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:22,990
is like playing golf you're really early

00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:25,000
plane against your personal best I think

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,740
it's really easy to forget that the game

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,039
is so far from over we're not even on

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,779
the back nine yet my mom mr. Tommy Erica

00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,130
you're the kind of person you just need

00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:35,080
to flip the head you'd like to flip the

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,029
device page first just constant flipping

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,590
ahead and I don't think that's true for

00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:40,779
me anymore I just think we're in the

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,809
middle of a really bad chapter you just

00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:45,909
want to know how many pages are left but

00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:47,710
there's no knowing that the only comfort

00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:50,860
we have really comes from knowing that

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,720
none of us not even the person who seems

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,389
to have their the most together

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,080
really knows for certain what's around

00:18:55,389 --> 00:19:00,850
the corner it's too soon to tell like I

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,260
said my real goal is to try and make you

00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,760
feel better so in putting this whole

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,220
thing together a surveyed everybody in

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,470
my inner orbit and I said to each of

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,639
them of you know what could I tell you

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,779
if I had a crystal ball what could I

00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,940
tell you about the future that would

00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:15,850
make you feel better finish them wanted

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,559
something slightly different but it was

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,299
all kind of a variation on a similar

00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:22,120
theme they all just wanted to know that

00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:26,019
it was all going to eventually work out

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,610
and I don't know any of you of what your

00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,139
personal hopes and dreams or goals are

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,770
for the future or what's kind of like in

00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:32,230
limbo for

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,470
right now but i'll just say to you but

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:38,500
it's all going to eventually work out

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:40,210
probably if you expected me to give you

00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,630
any sort of guarantee the speech or den

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:46,780
with how to buy a copy of my book okay

00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:49,360
but I'm but I will tell you that even

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,920
though I I can tell you for certain that

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,260
it's all gonna happen it's all gonna

00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,180
work himself out I would never be so

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,030
arrogant to tell you that it's never

00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,640
gonna happen nobody knows anything with

00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,630
that amount of certainty there are

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,100
things in my life that I never thought

00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,450
would happen i never thought i'd live in

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,990
los angeles up into a couple months ago

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,940
I never thought I'd be speaking here one

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,410
of the people who I surveyed when I was

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,350
talking about the future talking about

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:17,050
like really really scraping the Bob

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,810
bottom of the barrel yeah even asked my

00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,340
22 year old my little brother who

00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,720
speaking of things that I never thought

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,620
would happen I never thought anything my

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,360
temporary roommate but here we are um

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,930
and I said so i said to him i was like

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:36,550
Blake you know what do you do you think

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:37,780
about the future said no and I said well

00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:42,670
don't do you like do you think I like

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:44,530
being 13 he said I had all 32 worry

00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,980
about being 30 how do we have a limited

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:50,680
amount of time to worry it to be 22 how

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,360
about 30 to worry about that I said huh

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,960
since you don't think about the future

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,420
at all he said oh I mean I think like

00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,280
i'm downloading die hard right now and

00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:04,320
then i think i'm gonna watch diehard

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:07,060
later and that's about as far as I get

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,010
and I started going into my hole feels

00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,600
like huh but I'm to sage I thought

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,480
certain things have happened by now I go

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:17,170
to gym in a reglan I said I just I don't

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,200
know to what do i do what do I do now my

00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:23,070
brother looked at me and he said now we

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,070
watched die hard

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,780
and I don't think you meant it in the

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:32,970
Zen way that it kind of came out because

00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:37,820
one this is a boy in my new apartment

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,820
tried to make popcorn in a frying pan um

00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:44,130
but um they really stuck with me that's

00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,260
really all that we can do just do the

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:50,910
thing that is right in front of us right

00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:52,980
now with our full attention you know sit

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:57,240
down the computer look at the blank

00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:01,440
screen again for that 100th Eve or mini

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,179
date book that vacation callback that HR

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,390
person and the next thing you know

00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:09,240
you're back at the front of line ready

00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,590
to get back on the roller coaster so now

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,620
I was ready to finally think about the

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:16,140
future what do I want for it well a lot

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,500
of things I want to be a backup dancer

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,660
on tour for Beyonce I want to go to

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,910
Iceland I want a career that's

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,890
fulfilling I want to be able to put a

00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,440
fitted sheet on a mattress the right way

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:31,290
the first time I want a lot of things

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:39,230
but most importantly I want to be able

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:41,340
to go from this so that's because I

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,559
can't control the forces of the universe

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,630
I can't control everything the lays

00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,750
ahead of me I feelings going to enjoy my

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:51,840
I feel about it but I can't control how

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,820
I deal with it and that's my story and I

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,660
hope it made you feel better and if I

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,220
didn't tell you anything you don't

00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,760

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,720
only hope is my only hope is that um the

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:15,450
feeling like your world is turned upside

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:19,290
down what pause for a moment you'll

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:22,220
think of me and you will enjoy the ride
