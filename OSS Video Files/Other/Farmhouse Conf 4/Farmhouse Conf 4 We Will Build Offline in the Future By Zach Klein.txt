	00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,139
good morning so I'm going to tell a

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,930
story about the places that we make

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:17,939
offline I moved a lot I moved around a

00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,630
lot as a kid not because my parents were

00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:24,240
military but because they were young

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,220
when they when they had me and we lived

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,170
in places that they could afford so we

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,270
started off in an apartment and as their

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,719
jobs improved we moved from house to

00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,969
house mostly in western New York in that

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,579
stretch of the Rust Belt between Buffalo

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,700
and Rochester where most of the farmers

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,829
are from Northern Europe and most people

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,380
that live in the city worked in

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:50,760
manufacturing and came from from Central

00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:54,750
Europe and everything changed for me

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,460
when I was 11 and we moved to Indiana so

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,070
that my dad could pursue

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,750
entrepreneurship for the first time he

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,059
bought a business there and we came home

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,880
from school and he laid it out for us

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:10,740
and we were moving maybe a month later

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,290
this was a really interesting for me

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,659
because where we we lived in Buffalo it

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,840
was a really old suburb one of the first

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,460
that was built along the perimeter the

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,409
houses were stacked on top of each other

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,450
you know he had postage stamps for

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,090
backyards there's a sort of place we

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,010
left your bicycle in the front yard lots

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,680
of young families and you know kids just

00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,720
had to be home for dinner when we moved

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,180
to Vienna it was the sort of place where

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,090
you indicated to other people where he

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,549
lived by what exit on the highway he

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,890
lived closest to and every one of those

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,939
eggs exits looked similar they they had

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,439
the same clutch of you know of franchise

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,450
signs they were they were often

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,549
indistinguishable from each other but

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,520
for my parents this was a big move we

00:01:53,549 --> 00:02:03,060
got an acre of land we had a little pond

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:04,680
we could could even get a dog and but in

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,930
my dad's eyes I could see that he had

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,759
finally sort of gotten the castle that

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,480
he had he always wanted this the

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,950
suburban house but for my siblings and I

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,230
was it was bewildering because

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,069
there weren't any one to be seen around

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:25,040
us we felt very isolated and at school I

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:27,230
didn't feel comfortable either everyone

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,569
dreamed of having a pickup truck my

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:34,700
first slow dance with a girl was to a

00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:37,510
country song I didn't know and I'm but

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,620
like all children i assimilated and I

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:43,910
started subscribing to country music

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:46,250
weekly and my go-to karaoke songs today

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,400
still are somewhere in Garth Brooks

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:54,620
catalog when I go home to visit family

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:59,329
in Buffalo I I wanted to for some reason

00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:01,940
I wanted to I was very proud of where we

00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:05,450
live now but but internally I was I was

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,120
very turbulent I I began to feel a sort

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,069
of neurosis of not really knowing who I

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,900
was and where I was from I didn't feel a

00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:13,880
connection to either place honestly I

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,630
was too young to really understand the

00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:21,980
culture of Buffalo and I when I was in

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:24,410
Indiana I felt like an outsider I can't

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,280
trace why or how this neurosis formed

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:33,290
but but around high school I developed a

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:38,900
very deep compulsion to connect to a

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:41,359
place and I wanted well this manifested

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,959
I I I started for the first time having

00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,670
fantasies that I would make a place and

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,709
as soon as i got an ebay account i

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,440
started bidding with money I didn't have

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:54,160
on land in Utah that was that was for

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,750
sale and my parents would have to

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,090
negotiate with the owners when I would

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:04,579
successfully win those bids to explain

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:08,420
the situation but went from there is I

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:10,400
am I I began to envy people that lived

00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,989
in the places where most of our families

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,489
had emigrated from I really began to

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:18,260
envy Europeans I felt that more than

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:21,850
more than us they had a deep connection

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:25,490
to a place they you know ethnically they

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,530
they knew where they came from whereas I

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,889
felt like a mutt so I became obsessed

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,699
with genealogy and trace both of my

00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:36,590
parents lines my my dad his family had

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,169
immigrated directly to buffalo and and

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:42,919
they were they all worked in factories

00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:45,319
and my mom came from Belgium and they

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,610
immediately went to the farm and both of

00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,860
those families have lived in the same

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,169
place ever since but I i found the towns

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,060
that they came from and I was really

00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:58,880
particulate particularly interested in

00:04:53,060 --> 00:05:01,970
in my mom side and something very

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:06,080
interesting happened I I whenever I

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:08,660
would find you know in what generation

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,669
further back in the pedigree I would

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,159
immediately switch to google maps and

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,560
and look up the town where they had come

00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:18,169
from and I and I would I just begin

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,090
studying all these towns overhead and

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:22,310
then I'd switch to the next tab and I'd

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,669
look at the town where my mom's family

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,680
in upstate New York it's a it's a town

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:31,280
of a few hundred where most people there

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:35,030
are my cousins and everyone works in

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,620
some sort of farm and and I I realized

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,310
that vast difference in the characters

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,229
of these places it turns out that most

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:46,280
of my family who were farmers in Europe

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:47,990
they they they actually lived in what we

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,360
would consider urban settings they lived

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,449
in villages that were really tightly

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,349
knit in the farmland would be a belt

00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:59,690
around these these towns and you would

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:04,699
often live in the village and commute

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:06,590
out to your the Greenbelt almost because

00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,960
it was just the most rational way to

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:13,460
divvy land when they immigrated to the

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,050
States the United States used a plat

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,389
system for giving up land for new

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,580
immigrants so when you came here and you

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:23,659
applied to be a homesteader you were

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,719
given 180 acres and people would show up

00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:30,710
to their plot number and it was it was

00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:32,780
on them to build a house and you tend to

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,160
begin to understand well

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,139
this must have been extremely

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,540
frightening an unnatural fur for a lot

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,810
of people they were tape they moved from

00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,960
villages to a vast frontier that was

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,000
carved up arbitrarily into squares and

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,970
on these squares far apart from each

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,480
other warehouses that they built and

00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:55,760
people moved into relative isolation and

00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,070
I think it was during this time of

00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,570
American history that we developed the

00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,020
trait that would Revere so much which is

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:05,270
self-reliance we became a people that

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,790
were we came from a people that were

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,060
heavily dependent on the extended family

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,860
and the community to her people who

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,930
revered ourselves for almost being

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,180
isolationists for for revealing

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,180
ourselves for doing everything ourselves

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:29,540
so at this sum at this moment I sort of

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:33,290
sought religion not in the biblical

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:36,830
sense but I came across a futurist named

00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:40,669
alvin toffler I don't really I don't

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,680
know too much about him I can't say you

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,960
only think it says that he was prolific

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,669
he wrote 14 books there were bestsellers

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,080
and the very first book that popped that

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,070
made him popular was a book called the

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,780
future shock and he theorized that when

00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:01,850
he wrote this book in the 70s that there

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:04,960
was a a coming information age that

00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:08,270
would introduce variables into our life

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,860
and those variables would would change

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:15,919
so quickly that that nothing around us

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,229
would stay the same for very long and we

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,600
would in turn we would develop a sort of

00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:23,570
neurosis because nothing was constant

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:28,550
and this immediately resonated with me I

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:31,430
you know just working already primed for

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,020
answers I I felt like I deeply connected

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,630
with this philosophy that I was a person

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,520
that had already begun to feel the

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,870
effects of this inner culture because

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,830
it's easy for us to but to move because

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,040
jobs are so transient

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:50,190
we are not connected to a place and and

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,730
the inn for human history place used to

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,650
be so important to us and then he wrote

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,390
a second to follow a book called the

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,810
third wave I came out a few years later

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:03,390
in nineteen eighty and this is the book

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:08,160
that has really been my Bible for a few

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:12,240
years in the book he he introduced a

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,150
term called the electronic cottage he

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,320
theorized that we would reach a day in

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:21,600
which all of us would would be networked

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,280
and all of us would be knowledge workers

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,520
and and he believed that all of us

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,610
prefer naturally because it's in our

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,280
lizard brain to want to do so to live

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:39,780
someplace bucolic and that we would all

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:43,980
live in these these settings of very

00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,750
niche communities of people like us who

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,560
were who are sharing similar knowledge

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:51,960
and and the family would become

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,770
important again the family would be the

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,990
working unit we would we'd be sharing

00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,610
with the parents be more responsible for

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,080
teaching their kids they'd be sharing

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,550
their knowledge their knowledge work

00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,020
with their kids and the kids would take

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:09,960
part in it and it was a really this is a

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:13,170
for me a really salacious vision because

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,560
what I saw and it was an opportunity to

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:27,000
to make up for the mistakes to recreate

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:29,540
a new a new nation of places so that all

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,740
culminated about three years ago where

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,690
you know I'm still harboring these

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:38,610
adolescent fantasies of creating place I

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:44,160
I purchase some land in upstate New York

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:48,390
and I said about to create my my version

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,940
of this so I should state that that I I

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,490
do prefer the wilderness I I think it's

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,270
incredibly beautiful and as a designer I

00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:01,790
find endless inspiration there

00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:05,800
but a rural place is particularly useful

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:10,030
to just to try to build a community

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:13,850
because it's cheap to iterate there and

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:17,360
also you don't really have to worry

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:22,550
about permits which is much harder to

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:25,160
pull off in the city so I've invited a

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,720
bunch of friends up and we lived in a

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,550
cabin that was ready on the property it

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,340
was about 200 square feet we stuffed all

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:36,500
of our belongings into it and over the

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:38,690
next three years we slowly first set our

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,280
ambitions about creating really basic

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,850
infrastructure of course we built the

00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,590
hot tub first but then we built a

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:48,950
woodshed and then we built a bridge to

00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,420
you know to to get across the brook that

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,480
ran through the property and then

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,520
finally we started building more

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,910
permanent shelters for for us to live in

00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,730
and there was there was no speak of

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:04,070
commune the idea here is is this simply

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,400
that we are were arriving at a time

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,810
where all of us are unlocked from the

00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,360
physical resources that used to

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,920
determine where you could live you know

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,300
even if you were an accountant you had

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,610
to live in a big city where there are

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,410
businesses but more traditionally you

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,300
had to live near the docks if you were a

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,360
merchant marine or you had to work near

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,760
the coal mine but to a degree that's

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,850
never existed before in human history we

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,590
are now living at a time in which we are

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,620
relatively free if we make it our

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:36,920
priority to live wherever we want with

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:40,310
whomever we want and what's powerful

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,000
about this moment is that all of us most

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:46,430
of us have grown up on the internet and

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,740
and in doing so we've participated in

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,090
online communities that have allowed

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,960
that have taught us how to build

00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:57,620
community and have unlocked for us the

00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:01,370
the joy of being around people that

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:05,600
share the same passions as an anecdote

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:07,550
if you browse a real estate in certain

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,140
communities in New Mexico if you go to

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,889
real estate websites you'll notice that

00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,389
there's a cat

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:15,709
goriya real estate so you know most

00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:18,949
places will say lakefront you know a raw

00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:21,199
land townhouse there's a category in

00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:24,699
these new mexico real estate sites that

00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:27,290
say dark sky and what that refers to is

00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:29,199
these are areas in their communities in

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,660
which there is very low light pollution

00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:35,119
because what New Mexico is finding is

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,919
that a lot of retirees who might have

00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:39,049
formerly gone to live on a golf course

00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:42,259
are now really interested in astronomy

00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:46,309
and entire communities there are now

00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:48,799
four that are year-round that are self

00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:52,339
professed communities for astronomers

00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:54,499
and these communities have their own

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:57,290
building codes that restrict building to

00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:59,720
prevent light pollution and a lot of the

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,189
money and the the administration fees or

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,759
maintenance fees go to build common

00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:09,529
observatories when I when I saw that I

00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:11,829
thought of Toffler I I thought that that

00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:14,899
what he said was coming true that are

00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:16,249
our parents age and the generations

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:21,589
before them had grown up in this

00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:24,709
centralized industrialized world and all

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:26,360
of that was crumbling down of course is

00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:31,100
going to be a very long process but but

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,919
we're beginning to experience the age of

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,470
the prosumer in which we will not

00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:39,079
willingly just consume what is

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,989
manufactured and marketed to us but

00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:44,360
we're going to play a role somehow in in

00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:47,269
what is invented before we consume it

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:51,049
and we're moving towards a point where

00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:53,360
we are not just going to play a role is

00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:55,839
going to be we're going to I think we

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,779
are going to control the entire vertical

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,329
we're going to invent and and

00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:06,619
manufacture things we need and the

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:09,289
places we live in so people Brook

00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:12,709
continues to be an experiment people

00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:18,649
live there on and off when their jobs

00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:20,600
can allow for me it has been it has been

00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,970
it is it's been the happiest time of my

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,889
life primarily because it's allowed me

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,920
to achieve one

00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:29,100
thing that I that I have had a hard time

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,359
achieving anywhere else and that is the

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,009
experience of having a beginner's mind

00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:37,989
and what I mean by that is to have the

00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:44,319
to be with a group of people and to be

00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:47,829
doing something that that makes you

00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:49,649
unafraid to be vulnerable and because

00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:52,720
we're so often living among strangers

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:54,549
and because we're so often insecure in

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,489
the cities and communities that we live

00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:59,259
in we we don't it's hard for us to

00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:01,929
behave this way but when you're around

00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:04,389
people who who speak the same lingo and

00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:06,220
that's really important who who have

00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,899
made the same thousands of decisions

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,809
that you've made in your life to get to

00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:12,549
that time and place there's a sort of

00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:15,129
resonance occurs where you're just

00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:18,100
fearless and you can try anything

00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:20,739
together and you don't feel judged for

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:24,699
it and there's a level of joy that you

00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:26,079
can achieve that that comes from that

00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:29,559
can only come from being in the same

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:34,059
place with with with people who share

00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:35,769
the same passion so I don't have many

00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:39,699
more expectations for beaverbrook other

00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:41,889
than I wanted to create a place of

00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:45,399
permanence that will always be there in

00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:48,850
my life and I don't really I don't

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,679
expect my kids to to want to stay there

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,459
or refer it to be important to them I

00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:57,910
just I believe that all of us need some

00:16:54,459 --> 00:17:01,059
place of permanence that means something

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:06,909
to you and people that share the same

00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:16,870
passion so that you you you always have

00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:18,970
a place that's safe and magnetic towards

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:23,449
of the sort of people that that you

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,510
enjoy being around thank you

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:25,510
you

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,940
