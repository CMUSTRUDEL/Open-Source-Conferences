so the war for the pute for the future

00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:14,349
actually began in the past i know that's

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,360
a little strange right so i couldn't

00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,770
think of a way to create a linear story

00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,290
about something that hasn't happened yet

00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,240
and i realized that wasn't even correct

00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,660
that we really had to go backwards in

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,529
order to go forward I was actually born

00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:33,309
in Chicago during the analog here I just

00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:35,980
looked in for my age I brought a version

00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:40,480
of myself from then uh Salvador would

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,910
you come up here for a minute you can

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,879
stand right here this is exactly what I

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:49,329
looked like then and almost exactly what

00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:52,360
I was like by the way after my talk

00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:53,739
today Salvador it has volunteered to do

00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,180
something wonderful for people who are

00:00:53,739 --> 00:01:00,820
interested salvo what are you going to

00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:04,300
do mega autographed of what a for robot

00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,430
then I'm gonna make in the future cool

00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,770
thank you I think a never see you could

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,539
use this pad but people ask you I did

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,979
not coach him in fact I couldn't keep

00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:13,149
him from coming with me today as soon as

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:17,860
he found out this was something about

00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:24,490
the future he wanted to be part of it ok

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:25,569
that's it I'm out so back in my day it's

00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,229
when there were still islands of

00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:31,569
information when the world could still

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:34,420
be described in this linear way but

00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:35,739
that's not sure anymore is it but I was

00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,970
actually born when you called it

00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:41,770
futurism not retro futurism I know and

00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,840
what's the difference well retro

00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,450
futurism is the future is seen from the

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,759
past and the past as seen from the

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,479
future that sounds awfully nonlinear

00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,250
doesn't it and what I'm talking about

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,610
now is something we might call a temper

00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:00,280
ality the end of history not the francis

00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,750
fukuyama kind the kind where

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,270
everything's all organized in neat and

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,759
tidy and everyone stays in their box no

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,679
I'm really talking about the kind of a

00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,129
temporality that maybe it's best

00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,990
emblematic of remix culture of grabbing

00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:15,490
and taking pieces of things that people

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,569
did not expect to be used and

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,659
recombining them into

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:22,239
different ways that's really what i mean

00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:25,150
by n temporality and it's a term that

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,030
was coined by Bruce Sterling and William

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,579
Gibson as a way of describing the

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,849
strange sense of no longer having a

00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:36,430
clear direction for the arc of one's

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:39,310
life that instead there are multiple

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,159
arts going on simultaneously and how do

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,950
they converge perhaps they don't anyway

00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,079
back to my story so i was born in the

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,329
analog era and my first computer is

00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:51,459
actually an analog computer it was made

00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:54,760
from relays and capacitors and resistors

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:58,569
and you programmed it using punch cables

00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,879
I was able to write my first piece of

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,530
software which was a logic game that

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,549
went something like this you have a

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:09,699
farmer he had some grain he has a

00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:11,530
chicken and the dog these four are

00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:13,469
traveling along and they find a river

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,879
and they must cross this river

00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:18,760
unfortunately the boat will only hold

00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,819
two at a time who knows this who knows

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,030
this game okay not everyone but what

00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:27,099
we're almost done so the dog is vicious

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,549
the chicken is hungry the grain

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:33,790
defenseless what now the farmer has to

00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:37,180
think how will he transport across the

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,579
river without losing either the chicken

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,349
or the grain I guess he cares about the

00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:46,750
dog so the dog is going to be all right

00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:49,840
well if he puts himself and the grain in

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,659
then the dog will eat the chicken if he

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,129
puts himself and the dog in you see how

00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:56,109
this works right well it's a trick

00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:58,180
problem the only way to solve it is to

00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:59,199
go back across the river one direction

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,349
with one of the things you've already

00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,359
brought over so this was a very very

00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:06,280
challenging problem to solve using

00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:08,139
analog computing there any kind of

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,780
computing if you don't think it through

00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,159
and my first experience was building

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,889
this analog computer from spare parts

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,209
that my uncle owned a camera and

00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:20,109
electronics store which at the time

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:24,099
meant basically SLR cameras and the new

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:25,870
technology digital calculators Wow well

00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:27,940
I suddenly became aware that there was

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,430
this thing called digital and it was

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,580
very very interesting to me

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,700
so I took my analog computer and I take

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,160
it to the handlebars of my bicycle

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,080
ashwin and I wrote down to a little

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,390
place there in Evanston Illinois called

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,440
the itty bitty machine company anybody

00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,170
ever heard of the itty bitty machine

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,230
company well that's sad that was the

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,270
first computer store on earth and it was

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,370
opened by a man named Ted Nelson who

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,950
wrote this book he's also known as the

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,960
father of hypertext I this is my exhibit

00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:02,160
a I will pass this around please be

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,590
gentle this is my original copy so we

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,630
have relics of the past because now in

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,030
the digital era it's too easy to erase

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,010
the things that have gone before in that

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,420
sense of HF morality we're confused and

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,310
now whether things actually happened or

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,610
whether we only heard about them well

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,770
here's a little bit of physical proof so

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,600
I wrote down there on my bike with my

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,990
analog computer in turning they sell it

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,080
to them in exchange for digital computer

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:31,560
well you can imagine how well that went

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,690
and Ted Nelson was a known as I saw my

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,990
career marginally fellow he looked at

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,360
this scrappy scruffy really kinky curly

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,360
haired kid with a dirty bike and a

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,580
duct-tape analog computer and he said

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,220
I'll tell you what I'll let you listed

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,690
on my bulletin board except at the time

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,790
it was not a digital bulletin board it

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,080
was using cards just like these that

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,170
were actually tapped to a bulletin board

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,670
with ads for people who were looking for

00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,960
roommates at Northwestern University

00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:03,720
which was located right across the

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,040
street so from that point I realized I

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,390
was going to need to make a lot better

00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,370
friends if I was going to make any

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,980
progress in the computer industry such

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,960
as the ones especially being a broke it

00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,120
because there were no such things as

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,770
personal computers yet the personal

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,690
computer had not yet been invented they

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,380
were called microcomputers back in that

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,660
day well my parents divorced my mother

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,380
moved to California and by very good

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,810
fortune I found my sale near the first I

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,030
guess I would call it a collaborative

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,580
workspace for children known as the

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,500
apple tree the apple tree was a kind of

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,130
experimental laboratory opened up by

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,900
alan kay and his friend Steve DeWitt

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:45,630
Steve DeWitt became very very

00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,220
good friend and mentor of mine and as a

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,080
result are basically letting me hang

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,270
around and not pay because they charged

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,190
hourly fee for these Apple to computers

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,810
and of course I was one of the kids who

00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,400
couldn't pay so I just hung out and

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,660
eventually they would you know if

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,800
somebody came in was a paying customer

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,690
they kicked me out but the apple tree

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,509
exposes me in senior the fact that the

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,150
computing revolution have already begun

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,830
that technology was already there that

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,169
it was so compelling and so exciting i

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,910
was absolutely ready to ditch my entire

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,750
high school experience to just go to

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,780
this place and to connect to this thing

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:24,780
well i stayed in touch with steve and

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,860
alan indirectly and i managed to get

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,680
involved in the apple of advanced

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,669
technology group as a very very young

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,960
punk kid trying to go where I was not

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:36,389
necessarily belong but where I would try

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,310
to earn my place as best I could and I

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,780
was fortunate to see a pre-release of a

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,220
piece of software known as hyper card

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:46,110
and hyper car was the web before the web

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,639
it was a remarkable thing and it really

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,680
excited me because with some of the

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,550
ideas oh by the way exhibit number two

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,699
from the apple tree apple to programmer

00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:00,690
a number one you can pass these back

00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:03,270
just make sure they don't leave this is

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,330
what we use the program paper we use

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:09,750
graph paper back in that day to program

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,820
yes hard to believe isn't it so at the

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,740
advanced level at the apple advanced

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,330
technology group this pre-release

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,030
version of hypercard really got me

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,099
excited and started me thinking model

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,610
probably for the first time and I

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:26,010
realized something that hypertext was

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,630
just one side of a coin that was

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,830
knowledge it was just a way of

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,740
representing knowledge and that

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,240
inference inference engine something

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,370
traditionally associated with artificial

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,349
intelligence the creation of an

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,870
artificial psyche if you will or their

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,370
futile attempts at it that really hyper

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,860
textin expert systems were one side of

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,600
the same coin so I wrote the paper about

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,080
it it was published in byte magazine and

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,150
got very excited about these things and

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,860
created a product called hyper x it was

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,500
actually open source before open source

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:59,320
we just had free source code included

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,210
so i guess it was sourced included not

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,890
technically free and open source since

00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,060
that concept had not been introduced to

00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:08,590
my tender young mind as of yet but

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,830
hyperx was an expert system written in

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,870
HyperCard and hypercard had the ability

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,670
to extend it that you could actually

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,730
connect it to external pieces of

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:21,580
hardware and now this was a monumental

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,980
step forward I had started remember

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,830
soldering things together in the analog

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,650
world and all of a sudden now I across a

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,150
chasm that had led me back to a

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,060
connection between the digital in the

00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,490
analog very very early connection so

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,110
with hyperx we were surprisingly

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,830
successful for our day which is nothing

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,180
in the modern era we took that software

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,180
and we started doing factory automation

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,180
software it turned out that factory

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,370
automation was the big new industry

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,790
computerized picket place machines that

00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:57,040
the IBM's laptop computer the first

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,020
laptop that they ever built was actually

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,350
designed and manufactured in a factory

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,120
that the Quality Assurance systems were

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,620
monitored using hyperx and some external

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,630
commands or X commands as they were

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:15,100
known very very exciting era but then

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:17,830
then came the end the AI winter in the

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,050
90s perhaps overblown promises about

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,000
what we could and could not do combined

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,340
with lack of strength and financial

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,560
markets for risky investments suddenly

00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,090
the hot new exciting companies that were

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,430
doing artificial intelligence were

00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:38,260
literally gone entirely gone disappeared

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:39,940
so what to do about this well when you

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,970
live in the future it's a little

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,770
confusing isn't it because the stuff

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,830
you've already gotten bored of other

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:50,400
people have never even heard of yet it

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:53,170
was just too soon it was just too early

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,670
you know if Dan and Bill who had created

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,280
hypercar that just thought about it as a

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,660
network instead of as a file system they

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,060
would have been ten years ahead of

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,030
creating the web but they weren't there

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:06,580
yet the idea here is that it's about the

00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,730
ideas it's about the people the machines

00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,279
are nothing more than a manifestation

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:19,980
of our own humanity and how we express

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:22,190
that so far too toys so any sufficiently

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,320
advanced technology starts out as a toy

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:28,170
all right no it takes it seriously it's

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,899
a joke like we even say this when we are

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:33,870
exploring a new technology or a new idea

00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,430
or concept I'm playing with it we don't

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,459
say i'm working with it we started

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,260
playing with it why is that I think it's

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,240
because it relieves the cognitive

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,680
dissonance of saying I am really bad at

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,750
doing this thing but I'm going to do it

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,720
anyway we give ourselves an out right

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:51,029
I'm just playing with this it's fine at

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,160
some point we switch so much does you

00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:56,160
still do you know still trying that nice

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,620
not playing with it or yum I'm now I'm

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,630
doing something with it right it's a big

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,680
it's a big switch but they think that we

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:05,910
don't take toys seriously I think we we

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,480
look at toys and we think of them as

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,620
toys and that's a good thing because if

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,600
you really want to know what's coming

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,389
into the future come a really really

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,010
good toy store when i was in seattle i

00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:19,500
went to a really really great toy store

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,670
and they have a kit to build a hydrogen

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,350
engine or they have a home DNA

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:29,310
experimentation kit not to create you

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:33,389
know to analyze i hope that's a

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,220
different talk right and so the future

00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:38,760
is already here it's just the toy stores

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:45,360
and what toys are outlawed only outlaws

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:47,760
will have toys so I brought with me my

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,920
colleague agent sanket she works at the

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,480
hybrid group with me among many other

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:57,240
things we do we play with robotics we

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:02,310
play with robotics someday soon we may

00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:04,319
work with robotics so among my many

00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,589
mathematical journeys I discovered

00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:08,790
something called Conway's Game of Life

00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:12,449
which was invented while I was still

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,819
just a wee babe in diapers John Conway

00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:16,199
while experimenting with many many

00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:18,990
different kinds of mathematics

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:21,449
discovered something that John gunmen

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,200
who is the creator of the von Neumann

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:24,540
machine

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,510
that we think of is the basis for

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,250
computing perhaps it's turning but von

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,260
neumann's machine could actually be

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,350
created an even simpler way using

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:38,880
something that Conway called cellular

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:41,640
automata well we've all seen this right

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,360
who's seen Conway's Game of Life who

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,040
hasn't seen Conway's Game of Life okay

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,100
it basically takes place on a grid of

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,750
graph paper again graph paper is at the

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,690
heart of all creativity if you do not

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,680
own any graph paper go get some you

00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:00,270
don't have to stay between the lines

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,100
it's just nice to know they're there so

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:05,340
Conway's Game of Life is sort of like a

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,590
tic tac toe except each of the symbols

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,050
on there follows the same simple rules

00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:12,150
each one follows only a single program

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,510
and from that single program you would

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:20,930
get emergent behavior so if it is alone

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:25,410
it dies if it has two to three other

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:26,820
entities next to it it lives if it has

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,030
more than three it dies from

00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,870
overpopulation if it's already dead if

00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:38,760
it has two next to it it reincarnates I

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:41,760
don't know it was the 70s anyway because

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,140
we play a lot with robots and because we

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,540
play a lot with ideas we thought

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,000
wouldn't be interesting if we took

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,890
conway's game of life and we simulated

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,090
in the real world out here you know

00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:55,920
outer space like here so we started

00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:00,450
playing with this idea using some toys

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,010
again because toys are awesome so what

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,680
yeah why don't you bring up some of our

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:08,310
toys so these are some spero robotics

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:13,560
fears that you can buy it sharper image

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:15,930
or the apple store Biglow they move and

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,120
they have an accelerometer in there so

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,030
that they can detect contact in other

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,920
words this is the minimum viable robot

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:26,250
it has both input and output and the

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,560
ability to move itself that's about all

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,190
you need so what we're going to do here

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,990
is we are going to simulate Conway's

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,880
Game of Life few very

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,020
asians on the rules because we need to

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,640
adjust for the fact that we were in

00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,220
physical space and not virtual space

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,560
right so they're going to move around

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,779
instead of staying in one place so

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,350
that's a big change we still need

00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:52,300
contact though because as I saw the

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,310
artificial life-form contact is what

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,050
they need to survive if they don't have

00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,240
enough contacts or collisions then they

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,029
will die if they have enough then they

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,220
will continue so every three seconds

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:05,380
they're going to move around 30 seconds

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,660
is how long their lifespan is normally

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,089
it will only live longer if they're able

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,149
to make enough contact see a metaphor

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:14,920
forming all right so without any

00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:19,240
practice of warm-up let's see what

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:22,990
happens there green that means they're

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:26,370
alive they're moving around looking for

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,370
contact blindly

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,750
so far so good

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,530
everything's all nice o death

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,610
but no there's still so alive

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,910
they're losing strength

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:21,380
it's the board toroidal another that's a

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,569
there's no virtuality to this it is what

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,339
you see whatever they collide into is

00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:27,410
what they've collided into there's

00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,780
nothing else here than what you see get

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,950
dead ones come back now we didn't like

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,520
that that one's come back we don't want

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,500
to be here all day and I hate to kill

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:43,850
them while they're still alive

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:44,990
artificial life form or not no these

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,250
aren't pretty well I think it's good

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:52,940
there as an angle to get more speed o

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:56,480
our population is shrinking rapidly then

00:17:52,940 --> 00:18:03,140
they're trapped this usually does not

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:07,340
end well I have seen but the less I said

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:10,150
I can't kill them or terminate them it's

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,150
a bad precedent

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:19,970
I suspect they only have about 10

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,570
seconds of life left so don't get too

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,570
fond of them

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:40,060
we used to do this with 10 but that was

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:42,250
just too traumatic what's interesting

00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,370
though is the programming is really

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:50,260
simple it's about 60 lines of Ruby code

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:52,030
to do this and yet the phenomenon that

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,430
you observe they seem almost alive right

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,640
why is that it's because you are

00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,640
watching

00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:18,830
yup that's how much can they tell the

00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:23,839
difference between the wall and another

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:38,089
one the end this come ho sad we'll give

00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:40,849
it up for the sparrows so I say welcome

00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:43,820
to the machines let me take a look

00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:48,379
around now you can buy robotic devices

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:52,099
everywhere there's the ar.drone radio

00:19:48,379 --> 00:20:00,080
shack sells microcontrollers and parts

00:19:52,099 --> 00:20:02,149
to build your own robotic equipment I

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,969
have a feeling we may be stopping for

00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:10,249
one of those later as long as we can

00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:11,869
roboticize it I'm fine so we see now

00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:14,570
that we've entered an era of commodity

00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:18,399
hardware where AM oddity robotic

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:24,739
electronics are everywhere and you know

00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:28,029
what about the robot economics know when

00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:30,979
we think about the factory of the future

00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:34,779
the joke is it's a factory of the future

00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:37,940
has a man a dog and a bunch of robots

00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:39,259
the man is there to feed the dog the dog

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:43,820
is there to keep the man from touching

00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:46,219
the robots and someone we've gone back

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,499
to Kurt Vonnegut so you player piano

00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:53,029
which I don't know if anyone here is red

00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:56,239
but but really quite prescient for its

00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:59,450
era that he foresaw that the

00:20:56,239 --> 00:21:01,519
demoralization of the humanity when we

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:05,059
would no longer have some meaningful

00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,469
significant work to do especially in an

00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:09,109
era where most people worked in

00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:11,450
manufacturing this was a really

00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:15,589
significant cultural foresight to

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:17,599
understand that the humanity is going to

00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:19,579
be lost if we don't keep that essence in

00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,049
there so what about the robot economics

00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,650
because our current economic system is

00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:25,590
very much designed around the sir

00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,960
distribution of product to the owners of

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,610
the factory and to the workers that work

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,200
there and if there are no workers that

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,440
work there what happens to the product

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,270
I'm not an economist but I hope that

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,290
someone is and will challenge the

00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,420
current assumptions of our economic

00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,340
system with the inevitability that

00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,040
automation is creating productivity is

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,100
actually the enemy of the normal guy of

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:53,840
the normal girl of the normal robot for

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:57,000
that matter so what about robot ethics

00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,360
right do robots even have ethics only

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,930
the ethics that we tell them to have so

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:07,650
what is going to happen well I don't

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:09,990
know and as my friend Dan Rasmus says

00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:14,370
the best thing about being a futurist is

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:16,080
never having to be wrong today so

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,330
actually Dan with a fantastic book

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,120
called listening to the future where he

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,500
talks about some of these themes and he

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,870
does a kind of thing called scenario

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,160
analysis he works for a bunch of big

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,570
companies where they have a lot of money

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,000
that's for him to say the exact same

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:33,330
thing ottimo but he doesn't mean you

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,070
know nice thick format so but the

00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:38,840
scenario analysis is very interesting

00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:41,940
let's apply it to two axes of thought

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,090
the first one is whether the robots are

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,050
going to be sentient or not and the

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,200
other is whether they're going to be

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:55,080
friendly or not all right so let's begin

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,360
if the robots are not sentient and they

00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,090
are not friendly you had to put the

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,830
movie Brazil in other words basically

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:06,360
what we have today nothing works yeah

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,630
don't try to tell me your iphone works

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:14,400
perfectly I'll pull out mine and show

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:18,810
you data right so now if we have robot

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:22,970
up sentient yes but friendliness no then

00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:24,870
we end up with the movie Terminator now

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,120
personally I don't think that's what

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,700
what would happen I think the robots

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,900
would just leave like what's here for us

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,820
like the

00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:39,000
place is a mess let's go where there's

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:42,930
like asteroids appear iridium so um if

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,030
the robots do not become intelligent but

00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:47,280
they are friendly then we end up with

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:52,080
the movie side horn just hopefully

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:54,120
better active and then if the Romans do

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,810
become sentient and they're friendly

00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:00,270
then we end up with singularity now

00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:03,420
these are all Hollywood style scenarios

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,530
because you're in Hollywood so I thought

00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,960
it was appropriate but we don't really

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,180
know what's going to happen doing

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,990
because again going back to that idea of

00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:15,450
a temper ality you know the future is

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:18,030
always in motion the past is always in

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,130
motion when it's subject to change how

00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,750
will we understand our present if we

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:25,050
cannot understand our past and our

00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:27,480
future that is why these types of

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:30,750
gatherings are so important it's like a

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,570
tribal myth being brought into true life

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,070
today it's an experience shared directly

00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,230
from human to human without any

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,610
electronic interconnection it's just

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,500
like John nazm it's etnies book

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,510
megatrends which was also a very

00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,630
prescient book from the last entry he

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:47,940
called it high tech high touch the more

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,460
high technology that we have between us

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,380
the more touch that we need between us

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,940
and that's what we've seen with you know

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,890
attempts like social networking which

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,500
are you know somewhat pitiful early

00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:02,100
attempts at this there's no substitute

00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,900
yet for real live interaction with other

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:08,160
people and that's not something that's

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:10,110
going to be replaced immediately so what

00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,290
will happen in that future what about

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,820
those robot ethics that we talked about

00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,080
well there was another man back in who

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,350
spent a lot of time thinking about it

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,670
named Isaac Asimov and Asimov wrote down

00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,400
something he called his three laws of

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,830
robotics so I'm sure we all know them

00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,190
but i'm going to read them again number

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:32,310
one a robot may not injure a human being

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:37,740
or through inaction allow a human being

00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:39,870
to come to harm number two a robot must

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,540
obey the orders given to it by human

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:44,310
beings except where such orders will

00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:48,900
come in conflict with the first law

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:51,750
and then the third a robot must protect

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:54,180
its own existence as long as such

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:58,320
protection does not conflict with the

00:25:54,180 --> 00:26:01,890
first or second laws so uh how's that

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:05,670
working out so far for us people the

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:07,350
robot drone wars have already begun the

00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:10,010
list of victims from drones has been

00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,210
visualized with tragic consequence

00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,880
beautiful visualization of a horrible

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,550
existence but I don't think we can blame

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,530
the robots because they're not robots

00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,130
they're drones and they're being flown

00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:25,020
by human beings it's really the

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,880
dehumanization that has occurred turning

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,940
ourselves into robots a kind of

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,860
evolution that I think we do not wish

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:36,890
this is the event that has occurred from

00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:39,750
the distancing the am bigger ization of

00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:43,110
the difference between us and them being

00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:45,900
separated by this electronic curtain so

00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:48,600
I propose that we make a small change to

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:52,350
Asimov's first law of robotics just the

00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,260
one word change a human may not injure a

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:58,830
human being or through inaction allow a

00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:02,240
human being to come to harm imagine that

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,240
future thank you

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,460
you
