Description: 
	Emerging manufacturing techniques like 3D printing are shifting the way that we make, buy, and consume products. We're still in an era of mass production, but it is giving way to mass customization of consumer goods. What will we make in the future when we can make anything we wish on demand?

hi I'm Colleen um and I sort of fell

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,959
into a career 3d printing things

00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,820
completely accidentally um so I

00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:18,039
graduated from college two and a half

00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,260
years ago and you know it's the middle

00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,370
of like big part of the recession was

00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,940
like I don't know what I'm going to do

00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,230
like who's hiring product designers um

00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,450
so I just sort of started making some

00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,449
like 3d printed jewelry for art shows

00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,510
and i put it up on the internet and

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,359
people really liked it and i was able to

00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,899
quit my horrible web design and SEO job

00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:43,420
because people wanted to buy 3d point of

00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:45,940
jewelry and that was making me more

00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,789
money than making people websites so

00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,289
here i am speaking to you guys today um

00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:52,839
so i think a lot about what we're going

00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:55,329
to topic of my talk is what are we going

00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:56,859
to make in the future i think a lot

00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,449
about what we're going to make in the

00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:01,299
future because I also think a lot about

00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:04,839
what we've made in the past so I live in

00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:08,080
Atlanta Georgia and Atlanta is a pretty

00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,840
new city um it's like parts of the city

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,450
of just old enough for us to notice like

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,759
other kind of old I'm so I was in this

00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,350
old car factory that's been turned into

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,909
loft apartments and I really mainly

00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,430
picked it because it had big windows um

00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:24,399
and it's actually ended up being a

00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,829
really cool place to live because you

00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:28,119
know as I've started this career of 3d

00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:29,950
printing things you know I kind of

00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,990
reflect like Oh things used to be made

00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,649
here and for a long time they weren't

00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:38,109
again um I also live across ones old

00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:40,990
rail line that it used to carry goods

00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:42,729
and things around the city transporting

00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,399
them around the country and now it's

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:47,560
been turned into a bike lane so we've

00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,990
gone from a car city and we're moving to

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,509
having bike lanes around the city and so

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,579
I live in very close proximity to these

00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:57,039
two really all things well relatively

00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:58,420
old that are now new things so I think a

00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,640
lot about this so it's like these are

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,649
only 100 year old objects that we've

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,359
already reappropriation into new things

00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:04,990
so I think a lot about that like so what

00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,270
are we going to make in the future

00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,690
because we're already changing what we

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,760
made in the past so my business is

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,680
called wearable planter it's all this 30

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,990
printed jewelry that lets you carry

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,690
around a little plant

00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,830
so I can show you guys some afterwards

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,320
if you're interested I've brought a

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,510
bunch of pieces with me um so just sort

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,070
of started out with this idea like it

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,310
came out of this project that i had in

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,220
school of we have all these materials

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,080
that we make things out of and we don't

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,490
always use them we have these

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,690
perceptions of materials that don't

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,270
always fit with their material

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,860
properties so we have plastic things

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,540
that are disposable plastic gloss for

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,170
thousands of years before it biodegrades

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,520
and we make plastic bags and water

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,020
bottles out of them so i sort of wanted

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,820
to make something of a land quality out

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,000
of plastic because that's what most of

00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,320
3d printing is now so I'm sort of was

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,230
like I want to make something of a limb

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,800
quality of plastic and just started

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:06,000
making things from there sorry have to

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,470
reference my notes now yeah so really

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,460
making things out of 30 printing just

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,770
sort of started out of this like

00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,570
laziness that I had I was like well how

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,970
am I going to make things out of plastic

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:21,540
and I just sort of fell into it I was

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:23,580
like oh I can 3d print stuff so yeah 3d

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,250
printing it's how many people know about

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,960
3d printing already okay so the good

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,280
majority of you so it's actually a

00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,860
technology that's been around for about

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,720
like 25 years and we're only just arting

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,060
to like really know about it on the

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,580
consumer level um so before that it was

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,310
really only available like at schools at

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,600
universities and big engineering firms

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,580
that have it and within the last five

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,740
years we've sort of like hit this like

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,450
sort of node of knowledge where we're

00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,800
starting to know more about it and

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,650
that's really cool it's changing the way

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,840
that like how we make things um and it's

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,430
bringing this this power of making

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,920
things back to people that we haven't

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,630
had since the Industrial Revolution you

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,040
know we used to make things at home and

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,930
we went to making things at factories

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,550
now you can sit on our computers and

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,340
make things that we want on our own and

00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,660
then print them out at home so the

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,370
technology is changing a lot you have

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,459
MakerBot's you can make things at home

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,350
if you want or you can send it off and

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,270
have someone else make it for you and

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,700
that's like a power that we've lost we

00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:25,710
we can now make stuff for ourselves and

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,930
it's amazing so like what are we going

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,100
to make in the future with it you have

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,290
these great communities

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,420
springing up online like you have this

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,360
website called thingiverse so now you

00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,120
can make things you can upload the file

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,350
that's just a collection of thousands of

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,910
triangles and you can make these objects

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,370
that other people have designed you can

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,410
make them for yourself so where we're

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,060
coming to this we're also sort of

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,980
reverting back to other people making

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,580
things for us with the same technology

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,960
but we're really moving forward now we

00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,940
can make stuff on our own again and

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,970
that's it's really exciting it's

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:09,150
revolutionary also I mean I'm really

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:18,960
excited about sorry you forgot where I

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:21,960
was on my notes um yeah um okay so we're

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,310
going from the stage where things were

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,770
made in factories and they were shipped

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,430
around the world and now we're going to

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,840
be able to make things at home again and

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,370
that's got really good environmental

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,230
implications like there's just less

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,690
waste there's less transit costs

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,880
associated with it so i guess i'm going

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,380
to talk about another way that i'm

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,050
excited about it we can also bring back

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,740
things from the past one of my current

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,530
projects is um found this really tacky

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,040
teacup a few years ago at an antique

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,780
store i had this really great form and

00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,550
just really drew me to it but it also

00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,430
had these like tacky little butterflies

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,900
on it so i really have always liked just

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,630
sort of been fascinated by this teacup

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,170
and i just used to throw my keys in and

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,930
it broke a few months ago and so it's

00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:12,720
sort of nostalgia for this little thing

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,480
I own but what I was able to do as I was

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,670
able to rebuild that the shape of it

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,520
digitally and now I've already printed

00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,230
them and so what are we going to make in

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,860
the future we can make things that we

00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:28,590
saw in the past that we really enjoyed

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:31,850
and we can bring back to life things

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:35,430
that we sort of forgot about with it too

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,470
so I'm also really excited about 3d

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,020
printing because it gets us to a bring

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,409
back sort of like silly ideas so if you

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,050
have an idea like there's people

00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:47,119
making memes into 3d printed objects um

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,779
you can just sort of like silly things

00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:52,279
and we've lost that ability but now now

00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:55,909
that we have the internet we can share

00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,610
that with people um okay so how do does

00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:59,689
anyone know how 3d printing works

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,209
amongst people who know about 3d

00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:05,119
printing okay a smaller smaller

00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:07,129
contingent so it is is it's you have a

00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:10,249
30 file that you've made it in CAD

00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:13,189
software and so you make this you make

00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:15,050
this file and up until recently like

00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:20,449
this was was really hard to learn about

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:22,219
this and was really inaccessible um so

00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:23,269
happens is you have your file and then

00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:25,069
you have a machine that builds it up

00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:31,879
layer by layer by layer out of plastic

00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:34,189
and it's really exciting um you get to

00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,409
see if you've ever watched a blueprint

00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:39,979
it's really awesome because you you see

00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:46,569
things building up as it's like they're

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:46,569
growing into their shape and that's oh

00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,439
yeah there's a laser heads too ok so the

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,599
laser kinds okay so there's a few

00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,429
different types of data printing there's

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,919
fdm which is building up layer by layer

00:07:55,429 --> 00:08:01,399
of plastic but there's also you can put

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,039
down layers of a powder and a laser

00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:07,969
comes in so and build it up the same way

00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:09,409
it fuses it together so um I don't know

00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:12,649
we've never made things like that before

00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:14,179
like everything's always been it's an

00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:16,189
additive process where it's either like

00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:18,229
crocheting or knitting or its

00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:19,999
subtractive like like imagine like

00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:21,889
marble being chipped away so we're

00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,739
bringing this new additive process where

00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:27,289
we control it with machines and control

00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:30,800
it by ourselves there was a nice little

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:34,509
ice cream truck noise there I don't know

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,059
it kind of describes the magic of it oh

00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:39,430
so um I'm really excited about it people

00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,809
are always going to want to make things

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,939
I'm really glad that I was able to sort

00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,230
of just fall into making things as my

00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:48,620
job because that's all I've ever wanted

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:52,399
to do is just make stuff not really even

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,600
with a purpose but um so yeah we're

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,820
going to I don't think in the future

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,460
that we're going to 3d print every

00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,080
right now most of people that are 3d

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,660
printing or stuff like people like

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,970
myself we're making jewelry making of a

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,490
little trinkets or more sort of novelty

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,500
goods but we're also moving to this

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,140
place where it's becoming more

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,440
well-known nikes making shoes or 3d

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,250
printed souls so it's getting to be a

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,250
technology that more people know about

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:22,730
and use it's more efficient in the way

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:25,280
if you only make one thing and I really

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,450
want to see the future where if we only

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,280
need to make one of something we don't

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:32,210
need to make 10,000 of them like we've

00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,100
had you in the past so yeah so what are

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,470
we going to make in the future um I

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,480
don't really know honestly no one's

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,460
really knows what kind of things were

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,990
going to make in the future um I think I

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,670
know how we're going to make it we will

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,310
make it some things with traditional

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,950
manufacturing processes like injection

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:53,420
molding we will make more things with 3d

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:58,250
printing um sorry I keep having a look

00:09:53,420 --> 00:10:00,080
at my notes uh-huh yeah so we're gonna

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,840
make more stuff I hope you will actually

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,040
make less stuff that we do now so you'll

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:10,910
have lots of stuff that we don't really

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:13,520
need um my missile and I sort of lost my

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,730
train of thought there um but anyway

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,560
yeah I just imagine this future where

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:24,080
we'll all have a 3d printer in our home

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:31,730
it'll make things yeah I brought soup

00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:34,550
okay hotel okay so um this is a

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:37,100
tacky little teacup that I found um so

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:40,850
it's got a really cool form um and what

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,350
I tried to do was it was this it has

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,600
really cool for him but it had these

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,220
like a little butterflies all over it so

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,790
I really wanted to make a new one after

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,400
i broke the original and so heated as i

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,450
scanned it and that didn't work so we're

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,040
not quite there with 3d printing

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:59,870
scanning technology yet and i was able

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,250
to rebuild it my friends on a MakerBot

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,990
and you can see that it's not really

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,160
perfect which also kind of gives you

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,070
some of the limitations of the

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,540
technology right now but yeah like how

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,290
cool it up a in the future if you just

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,480
saw something

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,519
you really liked and you were like hey I

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,990
want one of those you're able to make

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,500
your own without having to go to the

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,750
store just make it so I really hoping to

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,230
just have a future were able to make

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,509
things that we care about more were able

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,550
to make just one of them we don't have

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:31,160
to make so many of them and transport

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:34,959
them thousands of miles so I pass this

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,959
around so

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,829
yeah it was all printed one solid piece

00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:46,309
so that thing was all basically one big

00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:51,069
string of plastic goo that was sort of

00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:51,069
formed into its shape from there

00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,720
yourself make model

00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:08,079
okay so there's two ways you can make a

00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:09,610
3d printed object so you can either scan

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,120
them which is a new technology that's

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,970
developing and you can also make it from

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,709
like a CAD software so i use solidworks

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:25,829
and you can build it up from there using

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:28,540
the geometries yeah so it's made from a

00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:39,160
collection of triangles basically that

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:42,689
are made in the computer selling the

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,689
physical objects yeah

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:50,970
I don't know yet honestly ok so anyway

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,920
so wrap everything up um I don't know

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,450
what we're going to make in the future

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,970
nobody can know I think we're going to

00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,220
make more things with 3d printing and I

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,790
hope that we only make things that are

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,790
meaningful to us

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,740
