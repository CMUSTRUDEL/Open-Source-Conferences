Title: MountainWest JavaScript 2014 - Bringing the Web Back to the Blind by Ryan Florence

Description: 
	By Ryan Florence

Its the '90s and you're blind. The internet shows up, and as it has for everybody else, the world has at once gotten much bigger and closer to you. The content is inspiring and the interfaces simple.
A few years later some sites start to act a bit funny so you avoid them. Then a few years after that, many sites are completely unusable. The web begins to slowly disappear one bad JavaScript interface at a time. The world begins to shrink and get farther from you.
It's 2014 and you're a web developer. You add alt tags to images and order your headings but have never heard of aria-labelledby or closed your eyes and used a screenreader. It is time for you to level up and bring the web back to the blind.
Join me and my screenreader in a dark room as we talk about fundamental accessibility strategies and learning resources.

bringing the web back to the blind I

00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,239
want you all to pretend like I'm blind

00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:48,379
how many of you have ever used a screen

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:50,330
reader I can't see your hands you're

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:52,989
going to have to do something else how

00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,100
many of you have used a screen reader

00:00:52,989 --> 00:01:00,100
thank you all right I'm not blind

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:02,450
anymore but that underscores my point

00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,430
behind this whole talk is that there are

00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,320
people with whom you need to interact

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,810
differently than what you're used to and

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,500
most of us developers are not very good

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,750
at accessibility and I hope that I can

00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,360
inspire you guys to go home from this

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,479
talk and do some real world things in

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,000
your applications for another reason and

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,440
that is the right thing to do so the

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,770
title of the stock bringing the web back

00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,750
to the blind we have a blind developer

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,869
at instructure who's on my team he's

00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,310
actually a front-end engineer and pretty

00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,330
much everything that we write has to go

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,030
through him and make sure that it's

00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,200
accessible and I talked to him about

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,970
what it was like with the web showing up

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,229
and progressing as it has especially

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:50,270
where JavaScript has gotten more and

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:52,789
more complicated so the web in the

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,740
beginning was very simple in fact a lot

00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:56,599
of people just use the links browser and

00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,520
would browse the web that way and it was

00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,170
great and all of the information that we

00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,649
all have access to was available to the

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,539
blind as well as those who are cited but

00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:07,550
as our JavaScript interfaces got worse

00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,200
and worse more and more websites started

00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,970
to get harder and harder to use then

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,319
there was a really dark period in the

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,510
middle where flash was all over the

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,230
place and absolutely nothing was visible

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,849
pretty much to blind users and we're

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,810
kind of headed back to that again with

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:25,340
all of these JavaScript interfaces so

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,349
please join me in bringing the web back

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,290
to the blind what does the word

00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:31,450
accessible main able to be easily

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,010
obtained

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:38,830
or used read a study where blind young

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:42,480
people took up to 11 minutes to find out

high five

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:19,249
750 4643 let me speed it up 576 p.m. not

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:22,550
one to am clickable Oh lickable 6am

00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:25,729
clickable so all those numbers were four

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,430
times in the month so if I get this

00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:31,249
magnet inside of a list voiceover off

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,020
and I click on these nothing Scrolls

00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:37,610
right and he's reading all these numbers

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,939
for the next ten days last day so anyway

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:45,199
there was a lot of stuff to hear before

00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:47,629
I could get to Tuesday's weather um let

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,539
me bring this back in voiceover whether

00:05:47,629 --> 00:06:01,009
Google's aren't HTML interact mr. Lin

00:05:50,539 --> 00:06:05,419
whether 98 1 2 T 3 p.m. when there we go

00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:08,569
 chant mom clickable mun 3 tuesday

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:10,879
oh he's got tuesday 3 wednesday click

00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:14,180
 good Mon eyelashes honey mom come

00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,339
on uh so what's frustrating about this

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,199
interface is that there's no way for me

00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:19,879
to skip past text element inside of it

00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,060
lists boys don't broth there's no way

00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,909
for me to skip past all that garbage and

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,469
get to some UI that's probably more

00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:30,830
important than a list of numbers that

00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:33,379
make no sense to a screen reader so we

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,819
can tell that even Google is not the

00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:37,399
best at this at least not with that

00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,469
interface a little bit more information

00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,629
you guys probably you can read that in

00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:44,449
the UK more than a fifth of young

00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:46,849
married couples first met online a fifth

00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,520
of people who are married a quarter of

00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:51,169
jobs are only advertise on online online

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,029
and the average person spends way too

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:55,399
much time on Facebook in stark contrast

00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:57,680
nearly 40-percent of disabled people

00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,569
have never used the Internet accounting

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,599
for half of all the people who have

00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:05,990
never been online can you imagine trying

00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:09,050
to get a job if the job website is like

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,839
that Google weather thing by not having

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,250
accessible websites we are totally

00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,289
making people's lives harder than they

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,020
already are

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,969
so let's make some accessible websites

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,009
and make people's lives a little bit

00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:24,259
better sometimes it's easy to say well

00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,330
only three percent or not three percent

00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:28,129
only some like tiny percentage of people

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,479
are blind that use our website so it

00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:31,520
doesn't make sense for us to work on it

00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,740
you've got to remember that while that

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,490
number is very tiny to you it is

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:41,569
enormous to that person how many people

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:47,169
are we talking about is the United

00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:54,589
States anyone from Wyoming anyone from

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:59,919
New Hampshire whatever that is north

00:07:54,589 --> 00:08:04,009
north dakota and then the other one a

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:07,639
delaware colorado probably got someone

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:11,240
from colorado here Rhode Island I lived

00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,749
in Rhode Island for a while and Vermont

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,849
the cousin of New Hampshire about seven

00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:19,069
million people have visual disabilities

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:20,389
in such that they need tooling to help

00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:23,779
them on their computers to use the

00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:26,300
internet all those states that's like

00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:30,069
every visually disabled person lives in

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,069
those states that's a lot of people

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:35,149
there's more than just blind users to

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,209
think about there's of course

00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:40,880
screenreader users by the blind there

00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:42,919
are Braille displays which have like two

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,480
rows of Braille that is kind of cool you

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,310
see the blinking cursor and it's just

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,149
these little bumps that keep going up

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,800
and down screen magnification for people

00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,240
that aren't blind but they need a really

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,899
big screen to see what they're looking

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,149
at colorblind there are people who use

00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:00,829
only keyboards they can't use a physical

00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,480
mouse because of some motor impairment

00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:03,920
and then vice versa there are people who

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,649
can only use a mouse and can't use a

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,329
keyboard because of some impairment some

00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:10,819
people need dictation because they can't

00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:14,060
read there are some really heightened

00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:16,459
around extreme cases of dyslexia where

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,959
it's not just like words but like

00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:20,209
everything is flipped around backwards

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,730
for them and so they need something to

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:24,350
dictate to them closed captions and then

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,319
head pointers you can google that and

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,220
see those but it's literally like straps

00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,150
on your head and then you've got this

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,680
big stick that comes off

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,620
your head and you point with your head

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,560
so those old flash websites with the

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,930
three pixel fonts and buttons there's no

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,610
way they could click any of those so

00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,960
lots of things to consider but we're

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,910
just going to talk about screen reader

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,840
users for the next 20 minutes so first

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,810
to understand how to make a website

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:54,170
accessible it's nice to know how screen

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,990
reader users get around and also I hope

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,520
that you guys will try to use I see a

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,290
whole bunch of max here I hope that you

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,850
will try to use voice over and learn how

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,680
to use your website with a screen reader

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,870
it's there's just a couple of things

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,460
that you need to know and you can make

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,120
your site's infinitely better for others

00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,910
so they mostly get around using headers

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,170
landmarks links and form fields so the

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,580
goal is to make those things good and

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:23,300
make them make sense here is some code

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,120
showing some of those elements one that

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,760
you probably don't know about is

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,060
landmarks so if I say that this role is

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,520
banner then I'm making a banner landmark

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,780
which is just kind of a big spot on the

00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,830
page that's easy for the screen reader

00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:41,720
to get to also got role navigation

00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:45,380
you've probably used this and maybe not

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,500
known why remember how the Google's page

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,660
said munn instead of monday you can just

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,580
drop an aria-label on any element and

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,190
have it say what you actually want it to

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,140
say instead of mun then it would say

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,120
monday if i drop monday and k here into

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:04,070
aria-label so anyway these roles all

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,950
create landmarks on the page there are

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,810
some html5 elements that will do this

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,940
automatically for you like the main

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,860
element you don't have to do role main

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,750
on a main element that tells the screen

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,270
reader that this is the main element on

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,310
the page and I think we've got real

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,740
complementary here same thing with the

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,060
aside tag that will tell the screen

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,130
reader hey this is just complementary

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:31,190
information the header tag means it's a

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:33,980
banner etc so here is a demo page let's

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,230
get rid of everything and do this again

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,510
voiceover on safari audio landmarks

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,240

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,910

audio landmarks demonstration in

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:51,889
backstage re landmarks in XHTML banner

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:56,179
so here I'm on the banner and to get

00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:58,160
around the page you do ctrl alt and then

00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:59,660
the arrows and then that's sort of like

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,579
you're moving your mouse around across

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,019
the page and changing your focus and

00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:05,119
that's what it will read and we have

00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,369
these landmarks especially sibling

00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:09,709
landmarks it doesn't go down into the

00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:11,119
contents of a landmark it just tells you

00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:12,649
what the landmark is and then we go to

00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:14,959
the next thing it takes you to the next

00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:18,199
landmark rather than listening to a list

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,179
of three hundred numbers so I'll mute

00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,789
this again site navigation navigation

00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:24,589
then I go next search this site with

00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:26,839
three items X subscribe to our

00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:29,239
newsletter group with five items that's

00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,149
our young validation with two items come

00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:34,239
to main content with 21 items so this is

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:37,039
really handy I can just jump around

00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:38,899
between all of these spots and now if I

00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,689
want to hop into one so as soon as I

00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:44,899
find the main content then I do ctrl alt

00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:46,369
shift down and then that tells the

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,350
screen reader hey I want to go into this

00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:49,730
landmark and actually read what's this

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,410
to interact with aidan entering main

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,739
content made landmark 21 items interact

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,299
with main content wait 21 items main 21

00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:58,399
items heading level one main content

00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:59,869
this tutorial demonstrates how to add

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,509
all your landmarks to a web page 28 in

00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:03,769
accessibility listing items bullet

00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:06,649
application not covered in this

00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:09,769
demonstration bullet internal link well

00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:11,239
it internal link complementary music so

00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:12,859
you can see landmarks make it really

00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:14,749
nice to get around the whole page and

00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:16,939
get an idea when we can see this

00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:18,949
visually we get that immediately because

00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:20,720
we see all of this design and say okay

00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:23,299
here's a sidebar here is this and the

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,859
visual designers have focused us toward

00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:30,529
the main content so a second way that

00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:32,989
they get around is what's called the web

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:34,009
rotor in voiceover but in other screen

00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:36,259
readers that may be called something

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:37,999
else but you can pull out a list of all

00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:40,369
the landmarks or a list of all the

00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:43,579
headers and things like that so let me

00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:46,249
demonstrate that real quick links 22

00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:47,149
items so I pull up this list shows me

00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:49,220
there's these links and now I can

00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:52,220
navigate through the handling now nap

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,600
duck banner headings 12 items that can

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,450
look through all the headers form

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,340
controls six items

00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:03,220
red spots 0 items landmarks 6 items so

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:07,750
probably the primary way screen reader

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:10,690
users get around is with headers links

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,370
to those civilians the best like without

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,200
us really thinking too much about our

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,300
code we do a pretty good job with

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,410
headers you've probably heard that you

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:22,420
need to do your headers in order and not

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,970
use them just for visual display but

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,400
actual like the organization of your

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,810
page the reason why is there are

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,030
keyboard shortcuts to jump from one

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,340
header to another and keyboard shortcuts

00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,740
to jump to the next header of the same

00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,800
level so if I'm on a heading level 3 and

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:42,520
then I hit em then M will move me to the

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,740
next h3 and then the next h3 and that's

00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,300
useful for them because they don't get

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,940
to see the visual hierarchy of your

00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,190
document or your app instead they just

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,930
get what you said is an h1 and h2 so

00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,820
that's why those are important to have

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,650
an order and to have things that are on

00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,010
a similar level to actually have a

00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:05,380
similar or the same similar but the same

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:08,110
heading level internal link

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,650
complementary always say well it's

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,870
enough for now sometimes you want to

00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:16,000
display things to a screen reader user

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,710
versus a sighted user some of those

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,050
scenarios are you want to hide something

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:22,780
from everyone hide something from just

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:25,060
sighted users hide something but allow

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,850
it to be focused you may have seen these

00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,350
like skip to main content links on some

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,300
webpages that will then jump you down to

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,040
the main content you don't want that to

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,350
show up and tell someone tabs to it and

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,790
then it will show up and you may want to

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,920
hide something from the screen reader

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,530
users so something that really doesn't

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,550
matter the designers just thought it was

00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:49,060
pretty I just pulled these from the

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:50,770
html5 boil boilerplate they're good they

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:56,110
work really well so if we can just look

00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:58,060
at these real quick so hidden this will

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,070
hide it from everybody if you do display

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,350
none visibility hidden the thing is gone

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,590
a screen reader user won't hear this

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,810
read to them a sighted user won't see it

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,520
visually hidden this means that you want

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,350
the screen

00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:14,880
readers to see it at instructure we call

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:17,640
it screen reader only either way this is

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,020
obviously CSS did not ever have this in

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,990
mind so we had to do really strange

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,540
things to make it happen but just grab

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,920
this from html5 boilerplate and if you

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,650
want it read to the screen reader and

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,420
not somebody else do it a very common

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:35,460
scenario for this is when you use like a

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:37,290
font tag or SVG for your icons they're

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,450
going to get like who knows what

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:43,500
something super weird or even like x

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,450
from the google page so inside of that

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,210
if you use in bootstrap and you have I

00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,650
for these icon tags inside of that icon

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,080
tagged you could drop in a span with

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,970
visually hidden and then type out what

00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,180
that thing is so new document or new

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,300
user or delete things like that and then

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,990
they've got the visually hidden

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:06,300
focusable for skip to main content links

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:08,070
and then you don't need CSS to hide

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,620
something from a screen reader you can

00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:15,390
just drop in an aria hidden equals true

00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:18,750
and that will just tell the screen

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:20,250
reader don't read this screen readers a

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,010
lot like browsers all behave a little

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:25,740
bit differently so on occasion it may

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,870
still read those but you can still trust

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:33,180
it and just say that screen reader is

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:34,980
garbage and it's not your fault so it's

00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,180
the easy stuff this is the stuff that

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,920
you should be doing just cuz you're not

00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:43,040
a horrible person the hard stuff are the

00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,790
rich JavaScript driven interactions

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,160
everything we talked about so far is

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:51,240
just simply letting the screen reader

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:54,180
user get around the page so let's look

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:58,400
at the hard stuff I feel really bad

00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,400
about this but I'm pulling in bootstrap

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:07,070
goodbye

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,660
voiceover on safari boot interact with

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,570
bootstrapped ads aren't very accessible

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:17,330
frown HTML content i SAT Brown you hear

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:19,820
that um visit internal link USA internal

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,880
link visited internal link Japan Japan

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:26,390
is it internal link Texas okay so so far

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,860
I'm thinking I've got some nabbit at the

00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,770
top of this page you are currently on a

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,970
link and it's going to then have like

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,230
paragraphs for each one of these

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,220
somewhere else on the page right because

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:39,260
it said internal link and a list the

00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,550
united states of america USA commonly

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:46,430
referred to as the United States you

00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:49,220
have source visited link wikipedia where

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,430
those other bits of commentary on a link

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:56,960
inside the muting it's confusing right

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:59,900
so what's the problem problem is that

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,520
contents hidden so now let's say and

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,770
this is what a lot of blind people have

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,090
to do I have to figure out okay I bet

00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,090
that this is bootstrap

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,249
so I'll just go click the link and cross

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,129
my fingers and hope that the content

00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:18,860
shows up alright so I already heard USA

00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:23,179
Japan so now let's click the press

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:27,950
visited internal source Oh visited link

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:29,149
wit where's the information about Japan

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,190
did you see that how is skipped right

00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:33,169
over inside of age so if I go back into

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,509
a nation in East Asia now I dedicated in

00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:39,679
the Pacific Ocean it lies to the sea so

00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:41,600
now if I come back up and I hit Texas it

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,220
skips over the Texas content and now I

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,919
have to go back one and then I get to it

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,259
I don't know if all screener screen

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,759
readers would do this but the problem is

00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:55,940
the code that renders that you know

00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,559
shows that next tab isn't fast enough or

00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,029
something there's some sort of race

00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:01,909
condition between the screen reader and

00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:03,679
a bootstrap to wear when I go to the

00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:07,279
next element to read it just jumps right

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:10,039
over it so how many people use bootstrap

00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,179
tabs a whole lot of people it's all over

00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,039
the internet and it's an interface

00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:15,679
that's totally broken for blind

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,029
developer or for blind users our

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,649
developer of course you can figure these

00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:20,029
things out because the inspects element

00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:21,559
and things like oh there's the element

00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:24,830
and then like makes it show and then

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:31,519
reach things but that's a lot to ask of

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:33,499
most people silver rod progressive

00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,970
enhancement don't throw tomatoes at me

00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:38,149
but most the time you're screwing things

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,590
up we get these faults fuzzies that

00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:40,879
we're doing it right you might think

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,820
because you've enhanced some raw

00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:46,039
interface and then threw a DHA sprinkle

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,570
of JavaScript on it that it's also going

00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,659
to work but there's a good chance it

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,429
doesn't screen readers all execute

00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:55,850
JavaScript at least the ones that people

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:58,159
use so when you enhance just the raw

00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,450
HTML thing that's not what the screen

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,659
reader gets like a lot of people think

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,519
they get the end result so sometimes

00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:06,230
people take labels and turn them into

00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:07,909
button sets and then like hide the

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,470
labels and think all people are so going

00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:11,269
to be able to tab to those labels even

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,950
though I've hidden them and then what we

00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:16,850
just saw here turning internal links

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:18,379
into tabs that doesn't really work so

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,880
let's go back to the bootstrap tabs

00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:24,360
again and see how this would work with

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,760
all of this stuff if i disable styles

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,820
and disable JavaScript and turn this

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,620
back on voiceover on safari bootstrapped

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,240
ads aren't very accessible brown window

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,280
bootstrap dad aren't very accessible

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,860
frown HTML content has keyboard focus oh

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,600
sorry interact with bootstrap tabs

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,200
aren't very accessible frown HTML

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,390
everton you'll see it well it visit an

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,180
internal link so now if I click on USA

00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,220
press visited internal link USA the

00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,170
united states of america USA commonly

00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,330
referred to you ting jumps me straight

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:57,960
to it and starts reading it and then

00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:59,490
same if I go back and I hit Japan jumps

00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,620
me straight to Japan and starts reading

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,520
it which is way different than what

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:09,270
bootstrap did to this page he's over off

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,700
so there's a better way and it's called

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:15,150
way Aria I did not even realize that pun

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,370
until this very second so stands for the

00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:20,130
web accessibility initiative accessible

00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,780
rich Internet applications and you can

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:27,480
go and see all the specs that they've

00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:29,010
got up there at that URL the way that

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,750
this works is HTML elements have

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:33,870
inherent semantic roles on your page

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,090
like a is a link h2 is a heading etc and

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,270
screen readers use these roles to

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:42,510
present your pace to the user but what

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:45,360
happens when you do a href pound class

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,700
button LOL i'm a button and you're not

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,170
actually a button you're a link and so

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:55,650
the screen you're just going to say it's

00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:57,240
a link to nowhere cool throw a role

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:01,830
button' on there or I have a better idea

00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:04,020
use a button even harder then those kind

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:06,030
of situations are when you create an

00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,130
interface that doesn't have a tag then

00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:12,270
what do you do like there is no tab or

00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:13,260
tab panel HTML tag to just tell the

00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,630
screen reader hey this is how things

00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:21,210
work and so you've got to come in and do

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:23,190
that so here the Aria spec has a bunch

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,810
of widgets a bunch of components they've

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,210
spect out and what the behavior should

00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:30,060
be and so now you've got this a

00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:34,290
coordination between us the developers

00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,600
the browsers and the screen readers on

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:41,490
certain roles and how those should be

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:45,570
presented to the user so tab is a role

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:55,890
and you see it says I should probably

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:58,590
turn my it's four o'clock thank you so

00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,420
it tells you a lot of stuff if a tab

00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,100
panel or item in a tab panel has focused

00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,530
the associated tab is currently active

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,780
authors must ensure elements with roll

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,420
tab are contained in or owned by an

00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,130
element with tab lists author should

00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,200
ensure tabpanel associated with

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,670
currently active tab is perceivable yada

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,560
yada yada so they've got all these specs

00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,170
about here's how your things should work

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,710
and now if we're all in agreement a

00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:24,720
screen reader can read it to the user in

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,330
a way that makes sense and so then we've

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,920
got the tab lists role and they will

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,920
illustrate out

00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,120
and I should have stored that link

00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,580
somewhere anyway they've got a better

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,840
link that explains what the keyboard

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,420
interaction should be and what they

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:52,800
should do when things have focus and so

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:54,330
I made a thing in ember I was I talked

00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,460
about that I was going to use angular as

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:59,100
my demos but the angular UI tabs just

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,390
we're very structurally different than I

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,590
expected them to be and they didn't fit

00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,570
this back at all and I would have had to

00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,560
rewrite it from the beginning so this is

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,830
the number cuz I already wrote this

00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:10,830
thing so now let's hear a tab interface

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:13,590
that's implemented properly voiceover on

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:16,410
Safari I see tabs went interact with I

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:20,250
see tabs HTML content usa-japan Texas

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:24,650
tab group Japan selected expanded tab 2

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:27,930
of 3 Texas select an expanded tab 3 of 3

00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:31,800
you see it's telling the user this is a

00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:34,530
tab and it's the selected tab you are

00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,800
currently on a tab 3 of 3 in some oops

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,870
Texas with two items tab panel and so

00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,430
you see I can just do a keyboard

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:45,720
shortcut and adjust me down to the

00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:49,020
content of that tab and I come back to

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,140
Japan USA collapse tab press USA

00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,990
collapse tab1 of text us a select an

00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,450
expanded tab one of three Japan tech USA

00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:01,380
with two items tab panel and so now this

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:03,390
tab panel is a landmark and since the

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,980
senate panel is a landmark I don't

00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,200
actually have to read what's inside of

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,940
it I can just jump over it so I get to a

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,700
tab group and I say okay this is a list

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,290
of tabs I hit next it jumps to the tab

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,450
panel and then i can hit next and it

00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,530
just jumps right over it it won't do

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,600
that on this page because i forgot to

00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,850
put content underneath but now that I've

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,600
got this tab panel I can jump into it

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:28,020
and then read it and you notice with my

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:32,220
keyboard let me turn off voiceover I can

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:35,310
click this thing and the tab the tab is

00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:38,510
taba bowl and then once I'm in the tab I

00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:42,090
use my arrow keys to bounce between them

00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:45,390
but these other pieces are not callable

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:48,720
USA in Japan should not be keyboard taba

00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:51,150
bowl so there are specs to guide you on

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,929
how to do this and the way that these

00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,610
things get implemented

00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:56,940
ended you just have to manage some

00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:59,879
attributes you got to give it a roll tab

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:02,460
keep track of Aria selected true or

00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:05,820
expanded true give it Aria controls

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:10,830
which that's which tab panel that this

00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:13,740
tab is controlling and then a tab index

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,840
of 0 to put this element in the tablet

00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,139
sphere as i call it so that you can

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,190
keyboard tab to it amber makes this

00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:23,490
really nice because you can just like

00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:25,049
bind attributes of properties and go and

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:28,799
find element IDs without having to set

00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:33,029
them yourself so anyway that's I see

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,889
tabs sometimes the specs are lacking

00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:36,809
sometimes they even have questions in

00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:38,100
the spec like for the tab spectres a

00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:40,230
spot that's talking about a keyboard

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,759
shortcut and it says should we do this

00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,490
how should we do this and you're not

00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,159
sure I call this audible interaction

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:49,279
design this isn't some like I added

00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,080
these attributes check we're accessible

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,639
any more than bringing your designers in

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,460
a room and coming up with an interface

00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:59,970
is like check we made this usable it's

00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:02,159
very much the same thing as a visual

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:05,129
interaction design the difference is the

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,440
year it's audible interaction design so

00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:09,299
my twitter profile says that i'm an AIX

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,649
designer now if we'll see if that gets

00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:15,119
any new recruiter hits so anyway point

00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:17,669
is you have to approach it the same way

00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,809
that you approach visual design which

00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:20,159
means you need to learn to use a screen

00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:22,470
reader because not everyone is as lucky

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,080
as us to have a blind developer on their

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:28,889
team I don't have to learn how to use it

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,269
though here's some random tips don't

00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:31,740
just throw Aria attributes you don't

00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:34,049
understand two elements so probably make

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,490
it worse than doing nothing at all the

00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:38,399
only thing worse than no accessibility

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:40,710
is like really awful accessibility a

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,509
previous version of jQuery UI tab said

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,249
that the tabs role was presentation

00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:49,669
which tells a screen reader this thing

00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:52,649
doesn't matter if you want to support

00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:55,200
keyboard our screen area screen reader

00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:56,909
users the two best combinations are jaws

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,369
which is a screen reader plus internet

00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:01,200
explorer and NVDA which is an open

00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:03,869
source screen reader plus firefox on

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,169
Windows those are like pretty much

00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:08,669
everybody uses those

00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:10,950
but voiceover plus Safari is probably

00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:12,690
more convenient for a lot of us and it's

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,960
pretty solid for general development I

00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:18,240
rarely have something not worked in my

00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,399
environment and then send it off to his

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,570
name's Erin send it off to Erin and him

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,700
say that it's busted if you got visually

00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,950
impaired users ask them for feedback i'm

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,019
sure they would be happy to help and

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,870
then when you run into accessibility

00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:39,299
issues send a pull request and try to

00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:48,230
fix them two quick things this tweet

00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:50,809
almost brings me to tears sometimes and

00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,950
finally a word from an angry Tim Cook

00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:55,710
when we work on making our devices

00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:00,710
accessible by the blind I don't consider

00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,710
the bloody ROI that's it thank you

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,270
