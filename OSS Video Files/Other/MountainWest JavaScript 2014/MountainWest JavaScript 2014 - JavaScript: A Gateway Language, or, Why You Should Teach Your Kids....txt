Description: 
	JavaScript: A Gateway Language, or, Why You Should Teach Your Kids JavaScript, by Liz Abinante

When we talk about JavaScript, we're not really talking about JavaScript: we're talking about JavaScript and its various libraries, frameworks, and compilers. JavaScript is a gateway language for new technologists, providing a large amount of functionality spread across numerous libraries, growing in complexity with the students' skill. Prepare your children for Skynet: teach them JavaScript.

okay hi I'm Liz I Benante I don't expect

00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,390
you to ever pronounce my name correctly

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,460
nobody does but i'm here to talk to you

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,690
about why is teach kids javascript if

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,340
you don't have your own kids you can

00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,059
totally borrow someone else's just make

00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,530
sure you have permission first and my

00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:45,850
number one goal this talk is to not

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,500
mention number so we're going to cover

00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,030
I'm sorry I just head said we're going

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,730
to cover what JavaScript actually is

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,899
because i'm pretty sure nobody knows why

00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,510
we actually should teach kids

00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,250
programming why specifically javascript

00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,700
and how to prepare yourself your own

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,020
hacker army so let's talk about

00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,360
javascript for a little bit because we

00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,950
haven't doing that at all today

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,990
javascript has many flavors just like

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,880
ice cream and you can enjoy the flavors

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,130
alone or combined in many different ways

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,500
and that's kind of what makes javascript

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,690
so great is you pick your flavors

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,350
there's no one right way to do things

00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:23,210
and sometimes that's great sometimes

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,959
that's terrible but it's still what

00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:29,179
makes Java scripts so fun and oftentimes

00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,950
I don't know how often you guys did use

00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:33,649
this word but I use a lot vanilla

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:37,399
JavaScript to talk about just JavaScript

00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:41,240
by itself nothing fancy no libraries no

00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,520
jquery nothing and this could be

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,170
anything design patterns functional

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,899
javascript even vanilla JavaScript

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,759
itself has tons of different flavors you

00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,349
can get that artisanal vanilla bean ice

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,670
cream in there or just regular vanilla

00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:56,929
JavaScript it's totally fine but I was

00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,440
making these slides and I was thinking

00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:01,910
to myself when was the last time I wrote

00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,280
javascript without a library without

00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,950
jquery or underscore our framework or

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,869
without coffee script and we all started

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,180
with spaghetti code with anonymous

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,819
functions and tiny things like this

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,069
which are super super simple but now

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,680
we've moved on so far beyond this that

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:22,280
sometimes we forget about the basics and

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,690
it's not bad it's just this is the kind

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,000
of JavaScript that you learn when you're

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,799
brand new to the language and this is

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,350
the kind of JavaScript that ultimately

00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:34,940
you want to teach two kids so why

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,650
aside from the fact that children are

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,000
our future there are actually some

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,150
legitimate reasons why you should teach

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,640
them so technology is constantly

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,830
changing which is pretty obvious but the

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,300
jobs that most of us have today are for

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,770
companies are in a field that didn't

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,450
actually exist when we were in junior

00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,880
high or even for some of us in high

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:56,030
school we're using tools and languages

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,590
but did not exist ten years ago and if

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,440
they did they're completely different

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:03,350
than what we use today and there's no

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,150
way really to predict whether or not

00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,310
learning javascript is going to help

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,170
them in their careers in the future but

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,450
preparing them for a tech heavy or

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,120
computer-based career won't hurt kids if

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,350
anything it'll improve it just make sure

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,750
you don't forget to teach him how to you

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,700
know read and write in math and stuff

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,050
students still kind of important I don't

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,350
know if you guys took ten key in high

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,870
school I did ten key data entry you know

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:31,250
the full keyboard did it help me in my

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,810
career no not at all but it didn't

00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,970
introduce me to the venality of data

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,680
entry which peaked my interest in

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,230
automation which in the long run brought

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,510
me into programming so thank you high

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,160
school time key teacher typed in all

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,800
those credit card numbers I will never

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,110
do that again I'm so while learning a

00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,210
language a specific language or even a

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,160
specific skill might not be directly

00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,170
applicable in the future they're getting

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,970
a technological foundation that is

00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,110
invaluable regardless of your age and

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:02,840
regardless of your career so this is

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,820
kind of a no-brainer but the earlier

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,130
that you start learning something the

00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,970
more concepts you can learn before you

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:13,060
eventually kick the bucket and I mean

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,200
really gonna talk the death thing guys

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,730
it's often said that it takes about

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,859
seven to ten years to master something

00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:22,640
so if you started writing JavaScript

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:24,080
when we were 10 11 maybe 13 you'd have

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,430
mastered it by the time you graduated

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,250
from college if you chose to go to

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,110
college and if you've mastered this one

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,350
skill or this one programming language

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,150
during that kind of short period of time

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:39,110
you're doing pretty well for yourself

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,730
that's pretty awesome and imagine how

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,740
different your life would be your life

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,600
specifically if you had learned these

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,200
concepts when you are really young like

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,670
a toddler or in elementary school or

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,550
if this was included in your junior high

00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,010
school curriculum you would know so much

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,170
more than you do now but also you could

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,660
do so much more than you know now and

00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,630
that's the real big benefit of teaching

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,400
kids if you start early they become

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,130
entrenched in technology they become

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,840
entrenched in the terminology and they

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,120
could create new theories they can solve

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,040
these unsolvable problems that all of us

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,720
who have been educated in somewhat

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,940
similar ways haven't been able to solve

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,730
yet they could figure out how to

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,940
terraform Mars with JavaScript who knows

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,470
but unlocking potential early it leads

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,120
to greater lifelong benefit for the

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,830
community as a whole especially when you

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,360
take into account open source software I

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,890
put glitter on this slide to try to make

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,660
this less depressing and I'm really

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,230
sorry but adults are kind of terrible

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,570
programmers only kind of we're not that

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:43,390
bad but we are limited in our abilities

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:46,030
we're limited by you know a lot of stuff

00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,130
really our education our ability to

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,170
learn new things the number of hours in

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:54,160
a day responsibilities we have as an

00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,750
adult but really when I sit down and I

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,330
start working on a new problem I'm

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:02,680
working on a new code challenge at work

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:06,610
I always worry and that worry comes from

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,280
fear adults are very inhibited by our

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,250
fears we're not terrible programmers

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,740
sometimes we just we just worry we're

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:18,400
worrying that we're going to be mocked

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:20,140
or that we're gonna fail we're afraid of

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,590
being wrong or breaking our company's

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,150
entire app taking too long to ship I've

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,950
had many friends complain to me I

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,950
haven't shipped anything in weeks I feel

00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:32,800
like a failure or just plain not being

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,630
smart enough and these are things that

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,910
are really really hard to talk yourself

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,620
out of there things that are in your

00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:42,010
brain and you worry that people think

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,560
these things about you too so we we try

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,120
and we try and we try but it's always a

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,000
little scary and if it's not scary

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,810
please tell me how that works I need to

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,950
know but I think the number one reason

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:58,420
that adults are terrible programmers is

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,729
because we lack the pure imagination of

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,740
childhood our problem solving

00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:05,919
skills are limited by our lack of

00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,919
imagination which is kind of directly

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,839
related to creativity really when was

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,990
the last time you had an exclusive a

00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,490
list tea party for all of your toys when

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,169
was the last time you put on a

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,969
mismatching outfit and trotted around

00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,659
the house and let your parents take

00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:24,430
pictures of you probably not yesterday

00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:26,319
probably not in the past 10 years but

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,449
these are things that kids do every

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,729
single day these are things that their

00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,729
minds just naturally think of things

00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:35,469
that are so different from us that we

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:37,689
would never think to go there and even

00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:40,240
though throwing a tea party for your

00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:42,009
toys may not make sense when you think

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,080
about problem solving and programming

00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,639
but that different perspective that they

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,430
have that they approach the world with

00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,589
you can teach them and shape them like

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:54,039
little balls of clay to apply that to

00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:56,020
programming somebody quoted Albert

00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,279
Einstein today and it was very upset but

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,210
it's okay because it's a different quote

00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,110
so no more anxiety but alright science

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,089
said the super great thing about

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,620
imagination and you can all read them

00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:08,080
hoping so I don't have to read you the

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,909
whole thing but imagination at the end

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,479
of the day is a lot more important

00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:16,029
because it's unlimited imagination is

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:20,080
only limited by how much you can think

00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:22,240
how long you can think for and my

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,680
imagination is different than yours just

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,740
like ours is different than the kids of

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,110
the world and so the imagination and

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,389
creativity that children have conquers

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,490
their fear I mean could you imagine if

00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,110
you put on that outfit that you wore

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,430
when you were to that was like one of

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,319
your mom's shoes and one of your dad

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,669
shoes and like your dad's work shirt

00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:42,010
apparently I'm the only person that did

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,389
this but any walked around the house for

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,610
like two hours when all of your

00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,050
relatives were over and wasn't

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,850
embarrassing to you as a kid but if you

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,290
came to a conference and we're wearing

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,060
something weird and people started

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,630
looking at you you would get embarrassed

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:58,690
because you're afraid you're an adult

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,430
totally normal to be afraid and because

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,620
children have that imagination in spades

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,420
their little tiny brains are perfectly

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,760
suited to be molded to make a tiny

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:11,560
hacker army they see things differently

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:13,209
and they think differently so ergo they

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,870
approach program or problem-solving

00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,870
differently

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,960
there are we tiny itty bitty minds have

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:22,570
not yet been taught how two or more

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,250
importantly how not to do things the

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,070
right way they just do them their way

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,720
they just think of it I wouldn't think

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,910
to wear one pink rain boot and one

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,080
yellow rain boot but I nannied a three

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,930
year old and she wore that every day

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,660
would it rained so there you go was her

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,089
thinking about how things match and it's

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,210
not stubbornness kids can be stubborn

00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:45,250
but that creativity is not stubbornness

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:50,020
manifesting itself it's just them

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:52,660
playing with the world and so we can

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,070
teach these kids because they're little

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,120
imagination bombs and they're going to

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,750
bring all these great ideas to

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,270
programming right but why javascript why

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,390
not something else why not Ruby or

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,770
Python I'm rubios and when I thought I

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,250
was giving this talk a lot of my friends

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:12,550
were like really you're gonna bash on

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:15,490
Ruby I'm not bashing on Ruby I think

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,380
Ruby's a wonderful language however Ruby

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,750
and Python typically require a complex

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,360
system set up that too many of us is not

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,040
as complex but nevertheless it is a road

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,390
bump you have to get over and you

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,209
generally need slightly more expensive

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,890
hardware and even though you can do Ruby

00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:33,760
and Python development in the cloud now

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,910
for free for next to nothing they're

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,920
still not as visual as JavaScript and

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,230
Java Script really really excels with

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,480
visibility it's why we're all here it's

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,180
why we use it for user interfaces it

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,760
makes visual things more compelling and

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,040
because it's a language of the web you

00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,020
get that instant gratification you get

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,600
that visual instant gratification for

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,680
kids and that's a huge motivator they

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,390
see what they do and for us as an adult

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,820
it's totally fine to tinker around and

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,040
console and see words and data

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,100
structures and you know variables but

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,630
kids don't care about variables why do I

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,220
care that my variable is assigned to

00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:16,930
read I want to see the color red and

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,880
last but not least a lot of people don't

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,420
like JavaScript because of the curly

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,990
braces but you know what it's good for

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,990
the soul it really is

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,970
it keeps you grounded that syntax can be

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,740
your touch point you check in to make

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,230
sure that everything runs smoothly if

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,910
you get errors sometimes it's your

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,480
syntax sometimes it's because you make

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,130
typos a lot like I do but it also helps

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,110
to teach new programmers to be slightly

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,820
more meticulous with their code they

00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,380
have to remember both sets of those

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,140
curly braces they have to remember that

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,490
semicolon and while not every language

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:56,170
has that type of syntax so many do that

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,640
we shouldn't run away from that when

00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,800
we're teaching kids and we shouldn't

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,870
certainly should not hide it you don't

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,050
want to bias somebody against syntax

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:10,270
just because it's a little scary just a

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:13,180
little so I've convinced you hopefully

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:17,830
it's not Ruby and it's not Python should

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:20,050
be JavaScript but why it introduces kids

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,330
to the web but also core programming

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,850
concepts at the same time without

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,630
getting too complicated too quickly so

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,959
you can start with a minimal scope or

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:34,600
small scope and minimal tools increasing

00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,510
your stack with complexity as the child

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,220
learns and if the child grows you start

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,440
with just that vanilla JavaScript we

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,899
talked about earlier nothing fancy but

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,870
it's good for you right it make you feel

00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:48,870
better and then maybe introduce jquery

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,310
or maybe teach them about canvas and

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,770
while it may feel a little tiny bit

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:56,130
weird to jump right into dom

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,480
manipulation it's again that visual

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:01,959
component that kids really thrive off of

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,050
when they're learning and there's no one

00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:08,170
right way to write javascript there's

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:12,370
also no one right way to teach it but I

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:16,089
do have a few recommendations for you so

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,740
to build our tiny hacker army first we

00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,620
must bring programming principles into

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,820
everyday life and if this is your kid

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,370
that you're trying to teach this is a

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:27,459
lot easier to do because you're around

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:30,010
them kind of a lot short charts become

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:32,770
conditionals if you complete your

00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,660
homework you get a gold star instead of

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,150
saying if you do your homework then you

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,040
get a gold star start framing that in

00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,400
the language of programming start using

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,490
the

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,350
verbal cues with your kids and if your

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,270
it's your chart and you can control it

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,000
make it look like a JavaScript

00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,220
conditional get creative get some syntax

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,180
highlighting in there print it out get

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,320
some emoji like make it super awesome it

00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,270
will be the coolest short art in the

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,670
world somebody dies startup idea chore

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:05,530
charts is JavaScript but two kids

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,090
conditionals are not super complicated

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,230
to understand in their day-to-day life

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,810
because it's basically a

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:13,210
cause-and-effect relationship you say if

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:16,390
you eat your vegetables you get to have

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,550
dessert then the kids they get that they

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,500
get the cause and they get the effect

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,020
but when you sit them down at a computer

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,120
and you try to get them to think about

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,650
that in terms of programming you have to

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,870
wait until they're a little bit older to

00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:34,420
do that but you know start young

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:37,060
indoctrinate early I'm want to say uh

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,950
and so while tour charts can be

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,320
conditional school lunches can become

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,060
arrays and items in their lunchbox can

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,330
have attributes their sandwich can have

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,730
a type of bread it can have a spread it

00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:51,820
rhymed and cleaning their room can

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,840
become a loop but I recommend maybe if

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,760
you're a little bit concerned about

00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,640
turning your kid into a supertype a

00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,990
cleaner maybe do a card game or dice

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:03,640
game instead of cleaning the room as a

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:06,630
loop just a suggestion and start small

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,580
we're back to that vanilla JavaScript

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:12,310
right cute tiny little function that

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,250
draws a rectangle or circle or star even

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,130
and teach kids how to call that function

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,590
with arguments super basic and there are

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,300
lots of tutorials on the web for drawing

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,370
shapes and JavaScript that are intended

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,250
for kids then it actually will give you

00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,180
at the end of this presentation and

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,040
they're really great because they

00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,200
reinforce spatial reasoning and

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,940
connection with programming and little

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,400
kids are pretty crappy at spatial

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,710
reasoning takes them a long time to get

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,420
that and so if you're teaching them you

00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,490
put in these two arguments and you get a

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,680
rectangle they change one of those two

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,470
arguments they can relate and they can

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,000
see how the rectangle changes and so

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,940
your wiring those spatial reasoning

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,880
connections into their brain earlier

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,880
then you might be

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,640
two usually and once they know how to

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,980
call those functions you can maybe help

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,560
them write one I know it's a big goal

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,630
but it's possible and there's tons of

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,670
great curriculum that is adapted to

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,940
different ages different learning styles

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,980
that will help you with that but really

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,640
the number one question here is age

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:20,750
factors how young is too young three is

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:24,140
probably too young it varies from kids

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,640
kid but at the end of the day these are

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,810
the three most important things that you

00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,400
need to take into account when you

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,350
decide to start teaching somebody's kid

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,510
or your own kid JavaScript or any

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,000
programming language really these are

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,530
developmental markers that I was so

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,860
happy I got to use my psychology degree

00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,760
when I was making this presentation yes

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,920
they need to be able to type accurately

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,950
or at least a little bit more accurately

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,440
than me and they need to be patient not

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,360
just patient in order to sit down and

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,850
have this conversation and to learn but

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,380
patience for being wrong you need to be

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,690
okay with being frustrated and that's

00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,100
different for every child but the most

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,770
important thing is that spatial and

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,780
logical reasoning which for most people

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:07,370
doesn't kick in until their early teens

00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:08,689
until about 13 or so and that's when you

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,730
can actually sit them down and they can

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,100
write their own conditionals and write

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,990
their own data structures but before

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,650
that you might be pushing them a little

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:22,250
too far so how do we do this how do we

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,890
actually make this happen plan I don't

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:29,000
know if you have ever watched

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:31,850
bridezillas watch an episode see the

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,070
spreadsheets see the whiteboards see the

00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,140
post-its see the binders that these

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,840
wedding planners have your plan should

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,310
be better than that I mean doesn't

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,990
really have to be that intense but you

00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,060
should have a really really firm plan

00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,030
for how you want to teach what your

00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,040
goals are and don't expect it to be

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,690
rigid just like anything goes with kids

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,970
you tell them they have to wear a jacket

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,820
but it's too cold they don't want to

00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,130
wear a jacket you have to be flexible so

00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,110
build a plan and build flexibility into

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,240
that plan don't be afraid to follow

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,890
their tangents they will direct their

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,320
own learning in the direction that they

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,409
want to go and sometimes that's me

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,299
sometimes that's awesome and set goals

00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:12,740
for those plans you should have a long

00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,169
term goal for why you're actually

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,610
teaching your kid how to program we

00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:18,950
should also have shorter term goals

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,529
little check-in points to see how you

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,809
and your student are doing a long term

00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:25,940
goal great long-term goal is just to

00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:28,759
have some interest in the internet and

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,500
how the internet works or to get better

00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:33,889
at spatial reasoning those are good

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,440
solid long-term goals short-term goals

00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:38,299
can be as basic as understanding a

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,740
concept or being able to repeat that

00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:46,009
concept back to you in the future the

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,350
most important thing in the world is to

00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:50,960
keep the lesson short kids have short

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,490
attention spans a lot of people do too

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,009
that's why we all bring laptops to

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,049
conferences sit there and you listen to

00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,639
somebody talk to you for 30 minutes can

00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:01,220
get a little boring and we start to want

00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:02,990
a multi desk kids have an even shorter

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,629
attention span than we do so keep the

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,879
lessons very short try to stick to 15

00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:10,370
minutes first if you can if you have a

00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:13,129
slightly older child or if they can type

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,230
really well or if they're wizards with

00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:18,110
data structures please send them to

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:21,110
Mensa and maybe make their lessons a

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,450
little bit longer but check in with them

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:26,029
keep an eye on how they're doing and pay

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,919
attention to how engage they are stop

00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:30,289
the lesson if it's not productive if you

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,320
continue to push them beyond their

00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:35,779
comfort point you've lost it you've lost

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,309
that entire day's work kids brains

00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:40,070
aren't really cumulative they kind of

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:45,139
we'll just dump stuff out keep it short

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:46,549
keep it sweet boom resources there's

00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:48,559
lots of stuff online lots of visual

00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:51,440
stuff and there's lots of actual code

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,110
problems to teach kids how to do

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,879
javascript and my name is Elizabeth on

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,309
