so you get us kicked off here I'm gonna

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,720
start at my left can each of you just

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,640
give us maybe like a two sentence

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,970
overview who you are where you work what

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,090
you do hi everybody I'm Jamin Holmgren I

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,920
am co-founder and CTO of infinite read

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:34,530
you may have seen me before but I'm also

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,680
obviously one of the organizers of chain

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,629
react I am on the react native open

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,399
source core team we're active in the

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:48,930
react Native community work on ignite

00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:52,579
react the tron other open source and I I

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,989
don't actually do a ton of react native

00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,390
day-to-day because I manage teams of

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,520
react native developers but I work on

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,800
tooling a lot and I have I have built

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,110
react native apps but it's just not a

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,990
day-to-day thing so my perspective is

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,520
gonna be more along the lines of tooling

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,500
and and supporting react native

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,530
developers was that two sentences so

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,530
many more than get used to it

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,900
I am a front-end engineer at an

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,820
engineering agency called assemble I've

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,710
actually been at this conference for

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,750
three years but this is my first year

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,340
attending as a developer and my

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,229
background is in marketing and I made

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,960
the switch to becoming a developer in

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:37,040
this past year so I'm excited to be here

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,040
oh thank you

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,439
so yeah I'm excited to be here kind of

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,950
representing the new developer and the

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:49,009
developer who's newer to react native hi

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,320
my name is DJ Fallon I've been a is

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:54,649
engineer since 2010 and made the switch

00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,799
to react native in 2015 right now I

00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:00,140
manage the mobile teams at skills just a

00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,149
quick plug we're hiring in both Portland

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,920
and San Francisco right now if anybody's

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,470
looking for a react native job please

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,530
talk to me afterwards I work on a

00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:13,280
product app that wraps games for

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:15,830
competitive multiplayer gameplay hi my

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,200
name is Laura Medallia and I'm a tech

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,750
lead at Haven which is a healthcare

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,720
venture started by Amazon JPMorgan Chase

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:27,410
and Berkshire Hathaway and I have been

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,600
working with react native for about two

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,400
years in the product space working in

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,030
healthcare so I'll be coming with the

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,860
product to the perspective my name is

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,349
Eli white I'm a software engineer on the

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,730
react native core team at Facebook I've

00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:43,720
been on the team of little over two

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:46,100
years came from a web background and

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,750
I've been working a lot of the core

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,670
architecture stuff as well as helping

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,810
product teams build like the highest

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:56,390
quality and performance period a can

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,060
great so I wanted to start off with a

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,620
question that is probably not super

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,959
helpful for them and it's gonna be very

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,600
helpful for me how would you explain

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,380
react native to a developer who hasn't

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,340
done react native let's start with Becca

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,590
actually think you're gonna be

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,109
pressurized sure um so I guess I would

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,959
describe react native as a framework for

00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:20,269
building mobile apps and also web apps

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,760
and other kind of like Internet of

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:25,780
Things related apps these days using

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,459
kind of react syntax and it's a way to

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,109
kind of dive into mobile development

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,239
without necessarily having a native

00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,010
background though having a native

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,739
background is certainly very welcome in

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,609
react native development sure anyone

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:39,609
have anything to add to that

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,250
there's like it's such a there's like a

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,980
thought happening I've always thought of

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,570
reactive is a better alternative to

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,550
Cordova or PhoneGap it's an amazing way

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,910
to build a cross-platform application

00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:59,210
and iterate it on it very quickly that's

00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,490
kind of my perspective on it and then

00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,890
I'll add the exciting thing I think is

00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,810
that you're able to be using react when

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,430
developing but ultimately what ends up

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,790
happening is that the code that you're

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,350
writing is going to be translated into

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,300
native code that can that can run on

00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,400
advice which I think is really exciting

00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,850
as well cool

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,739
so kind of building on that especially

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,510
for those of you who have been working

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:25,010
on react native for a while what would

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,990
you say are the things that you're most

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,990
excited about in react native right now

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:37,100
I think that the thing that's the most

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,540
exciting to me is the number of the

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,140
amount of investment that's happening

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,440
with not just Facebook although Facebook

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,940
obviously you know based on her maze and

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,860
and you know the rumors engine and

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,720
everything but the amount of investment

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,790
that's happening outside of Facebook

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,500
Microsoft there's Microsoft presence

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,620
here there's Amazon presence here they

00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,290
were our platinum sponsor this year and

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,510
it seems like I mean you all are here

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,980
right like you you're working for many

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,500
different companies and they're

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,870
investing and react native so for me the

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,080
thing that is exciting I've worked on

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,780
technologies in the past where there's

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,250
an initial kind of hype right and and

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,960
like everybody got really excited about

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,020
it and a few people were early adopters

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,850
and I was probably one of them and but

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,480
then it sort of just died out and and

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:28,910
and the ship went down and I don't think

00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,919
that's happening to change to to react

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,600
native because we're seeing just an

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,790
incredible amount of investment

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,980
happening into it so that that's that's

00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,230
more where I'm coming from but also I'm

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,970
very interested in the the maturity of

00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,400
the tool chain getting better and better

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,660
we saw that with with Mike's talk we're

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,200
just talking about the CLI and getting

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:51,440
better this morning so yeah that's what

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,670
I would say maybe what are you excited

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,040
about I've been really happy with the

00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,830
growth in the community very similar to

00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,630
jae-min I think seeing as we've been

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,340
like doing a lot of the lean core effort

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,930
and moving these modules out the

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,060
community has stepped up in a really big

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:12,750
way to manage these module modules and

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:15,270
these repos like webview have received

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,710
so many more pull requests and fix so

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,960
many bugs that have been so long

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,090
outstanding that our team at Facebook

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,950
hasn't been able to manage and at the

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,770
same time as we've been moving all these

00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,360
projects out we've gone from receiving

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,400
like two or three pr's a day to

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,110
receiving eight pr's a day on a smaller

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,850
surface area we've merged something like

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,800
six to eight hundred requests in the

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:41,310
last six months it's like totally

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:44,010
different but it's all of you that write

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,830
them we just hit merged so like don't

00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,420
give us too much credit thank you for

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:55,440
writing that seeing the growth has been

00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:57,930
really cool I mean honestly I think just

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,450
learning it I think because I have

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,270
worked primarily in web being able to

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:06,330
actually write mobile applications with

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,030
a much lower barrier to entry is just

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,950
really fantastic so yeah kind of just

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,890
enjoying the whole ecosystem in general

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,990
yeah and then TJ Lowe you you work on

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,720
products so is there anything that's

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:24,150
particularly exciting now kind of from

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,800
your perspective this is probably not

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,790
from the product point of view but just

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,390
one thing that I would sort of talk

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:33,600
about um is I feel like I I appreciate

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,250
that the react native team has been

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,530
showing a lot of like their commitment

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,240
to I think I don't know if people have

00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,980
seen surveys that they sent out recently

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,600
being like what are the pain points that

00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,280
you have and then the community got

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,140
really involved and talked about it and

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,900
then they went ahead and started to

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,490
attack 17 points and I think that is

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,990
really exciting to see because it just

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,500
shows how seriously they're taking it

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,720
and really makes us or me feel confident

00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,100
about investing in a technology for a

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,780
product that I'm building which is

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,640
employment cool

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,170
so with this survey I don't know if you

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,760
guys saw it I think we posted like what

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,470
do you dislike the most about react

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,210
native and the thing that's super cool

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,880
to me about that is that all of the

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:16,370
responses we just like collected them

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,590
and collated them and post it then but

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,910
then companies like call stack went and

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,380
actually did all the work

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,540
to fix them as well as a whole bunch of

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,520
other people in the community so like

00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,760
we're trying to listen but I think even

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,290
just our approach of repeating back what

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,970
we're hearing has shown other people

00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,710
where they can have the most impact in

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,420
the community I think people want to

00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,160
contribute they don't know how and I

00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,620
think it's our responsibility at

00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,360
Facebook to help you find the right ways

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,220
to do that so I think that actually

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,050
dovetails really nicely into a follow-up

00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,090
question which would be what are the

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,920
things that you think are the biggest

00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,260
areas for growth or opportunities for

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,060
growth and react native DJ you and I

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,230
were joking backstage that you we needed

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,060
to find the difference between like

00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:00,470
complaining and feedback so I'm gonna

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:02,960
put you on the spot to start off so I I

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,140
kind of a an odd perspective working on

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,570
an SDK and working on primarily in iOS

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,330
for a number of years I personally would

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,980
really love navigator to be a navigation

00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,710
to be part of the core but I think that

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,640
I'm kind of alone in that at least on

00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:21,200
this stage that's one of my pain points

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,360
and generally just performance has

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,910
gotten so much better over the years but

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,200
I think there's still room to go there I

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,330
actually want to follow up a little bit

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,560
on the previous thing and say that I

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,360
think this is one of the things that

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,630
sets react native apart from from

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,810
flutter I would say is the the

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,150
involvement from the community it is

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,340
very much driven by the community now

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,080
the core is definitely you know Facebook

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,090
in there they're doing some amazing work

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,360
and investing a ton in that and I think

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,980
that is appropriate for their role but

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,770
it's very community driven I mean the

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,280
community releases react native and

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:02,630
that's what we do and you know that's

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,490
it's it's a different approach with

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,000
flutter but it's it's it's a sort of a

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,000
differentiator

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:12,910
I would I'd also like to say something

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:17,170
that I really love about react native

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:20,470
not just the bad parts I I am astounded

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:23,529
by the web ecosystem that's out there I

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,510
had experience of porting stanza IO to

00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:27,850
react native to build a full-scale chat

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,350
application that's used by tens of

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,800
thousands if not hundreds of thousands

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,839
of users and that's just mind-blowing to

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,390
me and I love it it's not something that

00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,670
was possible the iOS ecosystem in the

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,220
Android ecosystem are very isolated from

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,140
each other and I think react natives

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,120
kind of helping to pour some water on

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,310
the fire that is the holy war between

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,940
the two mobile communities and I really

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,720
love that and appreciate it

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,490
Eli I feel like you're gonna have a

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,290
little bit of a like maybe a lower level

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,839
view of what's going on do you feel like

00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,730
there are any any particularly like big

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,860
areas for her grow through improvement

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,250
where you'd love to see more people jump

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,750
in and get involved so I think it was

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,380
touched on earlier that Facebook has

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,670
been us we we have been managing the the

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,100
core and bring a lot of the performance

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,709
improvements I think one of the things

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,760
that we are going to need to figure out

00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:22,990
is the third-party modules and making

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,570
sure that those are very high quality

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,519
and aren't just for an individual

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,670
platform one of the challenges is that

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,800
if you're building a native module or

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,360
custom component for react native you

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,130
have to be familiar with JavaScript and

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,690
iOS and Android to build something

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,279
really high quality unless you're

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,070
working with others that can help

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,050
balance that out and so I think that's a

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:46,449
place where we need to figure out how do

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,980
we get these modules to be as high

00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:49,420
quality as we want and keep them

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,820
maintained and I think the react Native

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,860
community has done a really big and

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,570
great job of this as we've separated out

00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,910
these modules a bunch of people have

00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,130
stepped up and Lorenzo talked about that

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,019
in this talk yesterday there's a whole

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,490
bunch of movements happening up

00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:06,070
happening on these but it's still a lot

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,019
of room for additional people like all

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,680
of you to help contribute and make those

00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:13,720
even better great have you hit any

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,610
particular stumbling blocks as you've

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,399
been learning react native like things

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,360
that you feel tripped you up or over

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,549
just frustrating to get started

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,499
here and there I think kind of initially

00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:27,559
some of the things that I was used to

00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:30,499
being very simple to do in react were

00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,299
not so simple to do in react native the

00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:35,029
one thing I can particularly think of is

00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:37,399
like trying to put a custom font into my

00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,069
app and spending like two hours on it

00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:43,220
and still not ever getting it working

00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:45,499
completely so I think you know it's a

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,699
it's a framework that's changing quite a

00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,529
bit and I think sometimes the

00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,959
documentation will lag a little bit

00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:52,819
behind those changes so that's probably

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,949
been the area where I've had the biggest

00:12:52,819 --> 00:13:00,049
pain points learning cool let's move on

00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:01,399
to something completely unrelated so did

00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:06,619
you all see that tweet from Danny or mom

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:10,249
about fast refresh mode okay how cool is

00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:14,059
that have you guys seen this tweet from

00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:17,600
Dan about fast refresh Oh somebody want

00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:20,360
to explain what it is because I can you

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,889
can't I can't okay definitely fast

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:28,699
refresh is a new replacement for both

00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:30,330
hot reloading and live reloading and it

00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:34,550
works

00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,550
[Laughter]

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:43,780
so hot reloading has been something that

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,250
day never mob has been like it's been a

00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,290
personal challenge for him since he

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,130
started hot reloading initially was

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:53,200
created to like demo redux and it was

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,050
kind of like a hack on top would fail in

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,180
all these cases and now fast refresh is

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,730
like okay how do we build this in to the

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:05,310
core of react in an ableist for react

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:07,810
native and to tell you how well it works

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:12,910
people at Facebook whose but who've been

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:14,530
trying this they leave it on that that's

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,100
it they just leave it on you know like

00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:22,720
you can't do that with hot reloading and

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:25,120
it it like reloads components and if it

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,620
can't for some reason it bubbles up to

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,750
the nearest air boundary and reloads the

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,950
air boundary you can change styles you

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:35,380
can change like constants if you have

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:38,130
runtime exceptions it'll like keep going

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,560
from that it doesn't crash the app it's

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:44,470
it's exactly what you'd want and it's

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,120
really beautiful has anybody else tried

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:50,770
this yeah have you worked with it at all

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:56,800
is it released we run on master I'm not

00:14:50,770 --> 00:15:03,820
sure okay same question has any retried

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:05,950
I have not I haven't tried it either but

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,780
I do want to say that like as having

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,570
such a very deep like react native

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:13,240
application that has hundreds of screens

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,370
and 90% of what a user seasoned the

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,550
skills platform is react native getting

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,080
that will save countless developer hours

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,240
it's just kind of incredible it's

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,160
mind-blowing

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,650
are there anything so like with that

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,260
being solved sorry to cut you off are

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,640
there things beyond hot reloading in the

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,400
developer experience that would make

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:37,950
react native a better work like make it

00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:40,500
easier to work with I think that

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:43,360
certainly you know talking about having

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,840
having more and better tooling around

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,270
things like performance and debugging

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,530
and you know we we know this infinite

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:55,980
red of course is put out reactor Tron

00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:59,500
any of you use react to drown out their

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,810
awesome got some reactor Tron last year

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,760
by the way Darren Wilson who works for

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,930
infinity red did a great talk on react

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,230
to Tron if you want to go look it up

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,700
afterward watch that talk it was a lot

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,970
of people really loved it and it shows

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,950
off sort of the power of reactor Tron so

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,050
obviously as react native we're we do

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,690
mostly react native we do some react as

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,820
well but but mostly react native we use

00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,680
react to tron all the time it's on all

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,630
the time and that's great like we need

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,330
tools like that that support that

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:31,210
support react native unfortunately there

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:33,550
are situations where maybe there's a

00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:37,080
company that does tooling of some sort

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:39,580
and they will have a react like awesome

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,890
amazing dashboard or something like that

00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,410
and then you get to react native and

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,060
they'll have like one person who likes

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,890
react native who's probably here

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,640
somewhere and they're the one maintainer

00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,960
of the react native side of it right and

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,320
and that's unfortunate because then the

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,120
support you know it really suffers and

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,430
it makes it much more difficult for all

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,110
of us to create performant and and

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:06,520
reliable apps so I do I want to see more

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:11,290
more stuff on the tooling side of things

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:14,260
for sure the survey I talked about

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:22,230
earlier the three top voted problems

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:25,750
were upgrading linking and debugging and

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:28,600
upgrading and linking have both I won't

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,650
say been solved but are like way better

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,550
than they were when we did that survey

00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,200
unfortunately have to upgrade to 59 and

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,270
60 to kind of get those improvements but

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,980
after that it should be a lot better and

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,580
I think debugging is another developer

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,770
experience thing and we have a great

00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,300
integration with chrome for Hermes you

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,520
want to run that on device that should

00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,890
really help solve that but I think

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,550
overall at least our team at Facebook

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:56,530
has been so focused on performance and

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,210
architecture recently we've kind of

00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,120
taken our ball our eye off the ball a

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,680
little bit on

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,620
our experience and the community has

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,090
stepped up with things like ignite but I

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,950
think we're starting to be able to shift

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,630
our attention a little bit more back to

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,540
developer experience even just things

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,850
like what errormsgs say and trying to

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,010
help people fall into the pit of success

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,890
and so I hope that we have a lot more to

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,500
share on that front over the next couple

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,550
of months I have a follow-up but first I

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,620
want to give you both a chance because

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,780
you're are there things in the product

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,130
experience that are really just in your

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,630
day-to-day experience that you would

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,150
like to see in addition to the hot

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,030
reloading yeah so one thing that I will

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,770
say and this is from somebody who's kind

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,640
of who came from the web world and I

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:44,450
moved to mobile development is that I

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:47,210
hope to see more testing solutions for

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,190
the react native mobile application

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,670
world specifically around integration

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,140
testing I think Mike my coworker Carly

00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:57,230
gave a great talk about screenshot

00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,440
testing and a solution for it but I'd

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,670
like to see more great so my follow up

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,710
you you talked a little bit about the

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,820
upgrade path you know you have to get to

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:09,350
59 and 62 to get that upgrade experience

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,270
what's gonna be required for react

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:14,390
native to hit like a like what you would

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,100
consider a stable 1.0 and this isn't

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:19,010
necessarily it's not necessarily a

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,540
question for you as much as its kind of

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,980
like what what do y'all think is going

00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:32,240
to be required what needs to exist

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:35,059
before you could call it stable nobody

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:41,630
should I just move on I'm happy to talk

00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:45,679
about it so so I think there's room for

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:49,010
many many valid perspectives here on

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,980
this particular thing and I understand

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,809
the core team's approach where they are

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,960
they're moving through a lot of breaking

00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,760
changes right so and they have a few

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,290
more kind of on the horizon that they

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,800
want to they want to make sure that they

00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:06,350
get out there and they don't want the

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,000
experience of react native developers to

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,850
be one of constant churn and and be a

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,480
you know version 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 you

00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,450
know

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:18,500
just really quickly jumping through them

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:20,179
but we're already there where we already

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,820
have them in production right they're

00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:26,720
not we're not waiting till 1.0 before we

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:29,600
release our apps well at least most of

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,440
us so we're already feeling that that

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:37,549
churn that that one you know well 58 59

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,330
60 etc so I'm actually okay like

00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:40,370
whatever

00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,039
whatever the you know the core team

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:46,130
decides as far as 1.0 one thing I will

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,720
add to this is that as a consultancy we

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,730
get clients who come to us and they're

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,590
they're considering react native you

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,510
know the the the competition isn't

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:56,720
necessarily you know other agencies like

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:58,490
you know call static or whatever they're

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,500
awesome whatever but the the big thing

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,899
is do we do it in react native at all

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:07,279
like do we just do it in native like iOS

00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:08,870
and Android native and they will look at

00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,000
react native and say well you're not at

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,159
1.0 yet so we can't you know we can't go

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,260
with that that would be too risky so

00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:20,750
there's a perception thing there that

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:22,549
could could affect this I have maybe a

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,019
couple things on my wish list but I

00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:26,870
think one of the big things that I would

00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:28,850
like to see changed or improved is some

00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,529
of the and this is coming from a native

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,990
iOS developer perspective of many years

00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:36,110
some of the internal build process parts

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:40,029
of the Xcode building the framework on

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:43,820
iOS are still seem a little odd to me

00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:45,500
kind of installing dependencies as part

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,549
of the compilation process that's

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,580
something that I would like to see

00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:51,289
modified in some way to be much more in

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,149
tune with with some of the great things

00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:55,970
that Apple has done with their developer

00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:58,399
experience a couple other things but

00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:02,750
they're mostly I build an SDK and you

00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:08,120
guys don't care about that so I think

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:13,370
our feeling on a 1.0 is that we really

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:15,019
hate that people have feel like they

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,580
have to tell other people like no no

00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:20,809
it's stable I promise even though it's

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:23,580
not one point out that's not a great

00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:25,440
thing for you to have to do and

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,590
we could fix that as you as you

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,149
identified I think we are team also is

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,110
like pretty disappointed in ourselves

00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:37,230
and like how many breaking changes we've

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:40,649
had to ship over the years that react

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,820
natives been around the counter to that

00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:44,159
is that I also don't think react native

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,220
would be as good as it is today if we

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,720
didn't do that and so I think our team

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,710
sees like a light at the end of the

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,820
tunnel of when we we think that like

00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:58,470
okay this is gonna be like way more

00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:03,059
stable and we'll be able to define its

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:04,379
API and actually stick to it in the

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,080
world of following semver

00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:08,909
which we would like we don't want to we

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,769
don't we would not go to 1.0 and then be

00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:13,980
like alright we're not gonna care about

00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:15,840
Sundberg and so in a world where

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:21,179
everything was baked into the core of

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:23,940
react native if some like this if slider

00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:25,320
component changed the like definition of

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,669
a prop and it was backwards compiled at

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,440
the backwards incompatible we have to

00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:30,570
like bump the major version of react

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,340
native and like that kind of feels a

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,309
little bit weird and so lean core is

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,289
gonna help a lot too if the core the

00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:39,840
smaller the core is the smaller the

00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:41,940
surface area is that affects the major

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,909
version and so our team is kind of

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,830
hoping that with lean core and fabric

00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:49,440
and terma modules we'll have this kind

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,600
of thing that we're very comfortable

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,779
with and it would make a lot more sense

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,330
at that point to give you all the the

00:23:54,779 --> 00:24:03,269
version number that you you want from us

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:06,779
a question that I'd like to ask is so

00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:08,639
coming from the web world right one of

00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,169
the things that we often tell people is

00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:11,519
you don't need a native app you could

00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:14,730
potentially build this as a progressive

00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:17,159
web app and so there are I think really

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,570
good arguments for both angles and so

00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,409
what I'd be curious to hear is kind of

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,259
if you could play devil's advocate

00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:24,539
against react native at what point would

00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,149
you actually recommend to someone well

00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:29,629
you should build the progressive web app

00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:29,629
you want to start us off

00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,110
so the first thing that comes to mind I

00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:37,350
mean everything is a game of trade-offs

00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:40,270
right and like your particular use case

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:44,950
so I don't think there's ever gonna be a

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:46,300
right answer but um I would want to if I

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,120
was speaking to somebody about this I

00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,650
would want to talk through like do they

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,540
should understand what they can and

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,130
can't access from like the native

00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,390
application like you can't get

00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:00,850
geofencing you can't have access to the

00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:02,380
two contacts or SMS and for some people

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,530
they might not need that and they might

00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,300
care much more about SEO which Google is

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,520
gonna reward you for for having a

00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,050
progressive web app and so there's like

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,309
there's a bunch of trade-offs like that

00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,690
and so I would kind of just want to go

00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:15,429
through them and talk through them I

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:21,760
could note that this question is

00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:24,340
sponsored by Gatsby yeah yeah so I think

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,900
a few things to consider for me would be

00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,820
looking at kind of who your main

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,160
audiences I know progressive web apps

00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,200
are very helpful to have if you have a

00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,910
large audience who's using your app

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,960
without super reliable internet access

00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,690
particularly I think since so many

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,820
developer hubs are in big cities we can

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,290
kind of lose sight of people who are

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,850
using the Internet and using different

00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,559
apps in different parts of the world so

00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,050
that's a really big consideration I

00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,340
think and then coming from a marketing

00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,380
background there's also things to

00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,990
consider like well do you want your app

00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,210
to be in an app store if so you should

00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,730
probably go with an actual native app

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:03,040
because as far as I'm aware iOS does not

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:06,070
currently support PW A's in their App

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,840
Store and also do you want features like

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,610
push notifications that can kind of help

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,960
increase user interactions so those

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,280
would be considerations that I would

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:18,880
take into account when making a

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:20,050
recommendation yeah we get this we get

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,670
asked this question quite a bit I'll

00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:25,210
keep this very short I've talked a lot

00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:28,390
but I I think I'll believe BWA is when

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,400
we get consistent requests you know

00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:34,200
right now we we don't really we get a

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:38,410
few but it's pretty few and far between

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,090
so keeping in mind that Brent is in

00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:42,840
attendance what does everybody think

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,840
about Excel

00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:49,960
good I actually used to do agency work

00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,090
like infinite red if I was still doing

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,340
agency work that would probably be the

00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:57,400
main tool that I use it's so easy to

00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:00,280
quickly iterate and it solves a lot of

00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,340
the I have to dive deep into the tool

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,350
chain for working on an SDK but working

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,150
on individual apps and putting them out

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,500
quickly expo seems to be the best

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:13,960
solution out there to do that

00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:17,140
everything's so supported for you yeah

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,240
I'm sorry

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,160
my first experience is trying to build

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,890
for react native were with Expo and it

00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,590
definitely was very user friendly for a

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,960
beginner I think where I ran into a few

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,830
issues was again kind of around

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,330
documentation there were sometimes some

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,850
things that didn't quite seem to line up

00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:38,050
but largely I've found it delightful to

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:39,640
use to be perfectly honest like I like

00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,010
not to try to put anybody on the spot to

00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,650
be negative but like it have you found

00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,420
like things that you don't like that

00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:50,530
where you get stuck or that you didn't

00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:52,300
like about using Expo I mean I don't

00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:54,070
know if this is fully where you're going

00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,470
but I one thing I appreciate is that

00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,320
Expo I think they have a webpage that's

00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,700
like why should I not use Expo and there

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,680
are a bunch of things that they list

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,720
there that I think are really great

00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,130
reasons why somebody might it might not

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,480
be the right fit for you and so I think

00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:13,600
you're gonna trade a little bit of

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,670
flexibility for the amazing kind of like

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,250
runway that they give you and and some

00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:24,060
people can't work within that

00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:26,560
flexibility limit so yeah we love Expo

00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:30,010
we have Native would not be what it is

00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,690
today without Expo that is like a huge

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,760
accomplishment for what they've what

00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:37,810
they've done and how it's been like

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,040
taken in by the community I think some

00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,390
of the really awesome stuff they're

00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,070
doing recently I don't know if you how

00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:46,000
many people have liked seeing their web

00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:49,540
support cool so their web support they

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,220
have this new beta thing where they like

00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,560
they use react native web but when you

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,070
create a new Expo project using the same

00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,140
code base

00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,210
you can render to iOS Android and web

00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,040
and this has been like something that

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,400
everyone is wanted for a very long time

00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,680
and Expo is like giving it a real shot

00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,420
and I think we're gonna learn a lot from

00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,140
that on the core team and in the

00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,610
community

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:14,620
and they're pitching in a lot of the

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:16,900
native modules and making them have web

00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,760
support as well as also recognizing that

00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,170
one of the biggest issues with Expo

00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,680
historically has been that you can't add

00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:26,860
your own native code but with you know

00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:31,120
modules which is their way to use Expo

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:32,620
modules in non expo created apps they're

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,940
giving back a lot of what they've

00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:38,140
created to the community and that's like

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,660
great citizens react native would not be

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:45,010
where it is without them yeah I'm gonna

00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:47,550
start with so-so infant red historically

00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:51,820
has not used expo very much for our

00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:54,730
client projects and I'll kind of talk a

00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,700
little bit about that when we started we

00:29:54,730 --> 00:30:02,440
started in October of 2015 using react

00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:05,500
native and Expo you know throughout the

00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:10,930
first few years of building it wasn't

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:12,970
quite there for us the we found

00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,710
ourselves having to eject quite a bit

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,390
when we would start so what we what we

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,490
built was ignite a lot of you have

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,050
probably heard about ignite and the

00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,420
boilerplate that we created we've

00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,670
created a few versions since then it's

00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,200
not based on an expo it just starts with

00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:28,240
react native and yet there's literally a

00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,710
command that runs and react native in it

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,170
so whatever react native and knit gives

00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:36,390
you then we sugar

00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:39,250
you know our stack on top of that but

00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:42,040
but I absolutely think Expo is the

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,540
future of react native and the reason I

00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,680
think that is because they're amazing

00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,870
team they're awesome

00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:52,750
like the Expo team is super cool and

00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:54,490
they they listen they listen to our

00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,370
concerns about like where we couldn't

00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,170
use Expo and they listened to the

00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,220
community in general and they keep

00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,810
working at it and they keep getting

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,530
better you know modules is a perfect

00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:07,780
example of this you know we we you know

00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:10,690
we were Native developers before

00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,460
we started using react native and so for

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,650
us dropping down into native code was

00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,720
you know they felt comfortable to drop

00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,160
down and just you know write write some

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,660
native code wherever we needed to and we

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:25,510
needed to a lot so not having that that

00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,790
escape hatch was you know kind of the

00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,860
big thing but I do I love the direction

00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,500
they're going and I what I really want

00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,360
to do is eventually get to where ignite

00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:38,020
is not using react native in its using

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,380
Expo you know creating using Expo CLI to

00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:43,330
create a new react native app and then

00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,400
we sugar our stack on top of that you

00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,290
can build pretty much anything and you

00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,350
can of course still eject and then what

00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:53,050
Brent Brent and I were talking about

00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:55,060
when you do eject it feels more like you

00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:57,250
you know you're right into a react

00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:59,850
native app and it allows you to keep

00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,930
going from there so yeah very bullish on

00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:06,640
Expo even though we haven't used it

00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:08,380
historically in good I think I can

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,600
provide like a slightly different

00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,310
perspective on Expo I do really love it

00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,540
and I've used so many things that Brent

00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,910
has written over the years I'm so

00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,930
thankful for the work that they've done

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:19,780
but there were a few things you said

00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:22,060
while you were talking that it reminded

00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,550
me of one of the riskier parts of the

00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,230
JavaScript ecosystem as a whole how many

00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,330
people were hit by the hole left pad

00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:32,320
incident about a year and a half ago

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:34,990
show hands anybody yeah and so that's

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,310
that is one of the one of the things

00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,770
that you have to take into account if

00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:41,530
you want to decide to use Expo or other

00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,810
tools that are being built in the react

00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,120
native ecosystem right now you are

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:48,100
already one layer removed from the metal

00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,410
when you're using react native and then

00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,540
you add expo you're removed again or

00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:55,290
other tools like that so you do have to

00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,880
be aware that that can cause you pain

00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:59,440
they do a wonderful job of making it

00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,970
painless and it's getting better all the

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,620
time but it is something you should be

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:10,330
aware of know that you're getting into

00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:11,620
that great but I have such a tangential

00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,660
thing I'm not gonna ask I'm gonna stay

00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,190
on topic okay instead

00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,410
everybody's been too nice so I'm gonna

00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,929
ask a like Jerry Springer style question

00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:21,539
here

00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:26,789
which state management library is best

00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:29,039
and why so I'm originally from

00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:31,559
Cincinnati so Jerry Springer references

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,629
really resonate with me knows who's the

00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:36,389
mayor of Cincinnati for a while

00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:39,269
I don't use one we came from a

00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:41,969
brownfield world we have a caching

00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:46,139
system based on HTTP headers and URLs

00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:47,879
and we typically stick with more of an

00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:50,279
MVC pattern maybe that's because we were

00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:52,259
mostly native developers before we move

00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:55,609
to JavaScript and haven't had that kind

00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:59,849
of saying in interjected into our world

00:33:55,609 --> 00:34:02,729
but that's where I come from you're

00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:06,330
coming in fresh what do you think well I

00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:08,909
have a couple of really crazy tech hot

00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:14,010
takes which are like it doesn't it

00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:16,409
depends and use what you like I would

00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:18,089
say though like I'm being newer I

00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:20,789
haven't really had a chance to dive into

00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:23,279
like hooks too much but what I've done a

00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:25,049
little bit has seemed really promising

00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:27,119
I think in my experience using like

00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:30,629
Redux has largely been the most

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,480
successful at being like persistent but

00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:36,149
has a very large barrier to entry since

00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,460
it is complicated my first week at my

00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:39,990
new job I was on a project that used

00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,299
typescript which I had never used before

00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:45,059
and Redux which I was not very good at

00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:47,520
yet and it was just like oh god what is

00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:49,589
breaking what thing right now so that

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,529
was a struggle and I've also had good

00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:54,720
luck with context API but I've found

00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:56,490
that in some cases particularly if

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,869
you're managing like login state or

00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,299
something along those lines it doesn't

00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:02,220
always persist the whole way through so

00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:05,309
you'll be if you go like one particular

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,130
route you'll lose your state so yeah

00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:09,660
that's kind of been my experience so far

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:13,529
again I think it kind of just depends on

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:17,400
what you're doing so yep real spicy

00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:19,890
takes up here today what do ya what do

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,529
you think I mean I agree it depends on

00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,700
what you do and you're unique the other

00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:24,860
killing me I thought we're gonna be

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,690
throwing chairs up here

00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,730
[Laughter]

00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,810
I'll talk about my personal experience

00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:32,330
because I've had a really positive

00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,400
experience on I was when I first started

00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,020
working with reaction on the web and the

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,630
first react native application I worked

00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,850
on I was originally using Redux as well

00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:44,210
and in making a lot of Brussels API

00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:46,910
calls so there was a lot of remote like

00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,860
reading and writing and then moved over

00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,300
to graph QL which is great for other

00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,850
reasons that I won't rant about

00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,730
graphical right now and used Apollo on

00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:58,850
top of it and and then found that that

00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:01,730
actually when moving to start using

00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:04,040
Apollo actually most of the like restful

00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,290
api calls that I was making and bringing

00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,260
into Redux we're kind of like replaced

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:11,960
by Apollo and it's been really great it

00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:15,020
kind of it gives you like error handling

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,930
loading state it can handle caching for

00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,640
you and batching queries so I've had a

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,070
really positive experience with Apollo

00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,470
and it's captured a lot of the

00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:31,300
application state management in the

00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:35,720
products that I've worked under yeah

00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:38,240
yeah so we use of course ignite to

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,800
create most of our new projects and the

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,280
first iteration of the boilerplate

00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,230
used Redux and Redux sagas because Redux

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,450
doesn't totally solve the side effects

00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:51,020
side of it so redox sagas was a good way

00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:52,340
to go and we really liked it and we use

00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,790
it for quite a while for quite a few

00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:57,310
apps but one of the you know criticisms

00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,840
of Redux is of course how much

00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:01,460
boilerplate you have to write there's

00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,630
just lots of you have to touch many

00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,070
files and you have to write lots of

00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,170
they're they're maybe not complex

00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:09,410
altogether it's a pretty straightforward

00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:11,270
pattern I think someone said on Twitter

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:15,200
that Redux is mainly just a good set of

00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:18,800
Doc's not really a library and that's

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,870
kind of true however we with our next

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,930
version of the boilerplate we went a

00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:26,690
different direction and we used a

00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:29,090
library called mob X state tree does

00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:31,370
anybody use mob X Street stay tree we

00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:34,280
all right we got some got some people

00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:35,690
out there I I think Redux is still by

00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,950
far you know

00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:42,170
the thing that has the most adoption but

00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,240
ma back state rates so mob X there's mob

00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:46,010
X and then there's mob X state tree mob

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,200
X is sort of like the engine underneath

00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:50,059
it and you have almost too much

00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,510
flexibility mob X date tree is like hey

00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:55,190
here's how to use mob X so think of a

00:37:53,510 --> 00:38:00,500
mob X state tree has been closer to a

00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:02,089
Redux pattern and what is really nice

00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,799
about mob X state tree is how little

00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:05,780
code you write and all of your state

00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:08,119
management is take care of like that's

00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,400
the biggest thing about it and it's very

00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,339
efficient extremely efficient it updates

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,319
you know like if you make state changes

00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:16,940
you don't have to worry about you know a

00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:18,950
lot of things that just takes care of it

00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,630
under the hood and I would recommend if

00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:24,530
you are considering using mob X state

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:26,869
tree what you should do is hire for a

00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:30,349
training session Michelle West straight

00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:32,990
who created it I got a chance to meet

00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,430
him in Finland he's fantastic and I

00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,410
hired him to come and talk to my team

00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,640
and he gave us an overview of Mavic

00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,230
state tree and when you go away from

00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,690
that you're gonna be like mind blown

00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:44,799
this is awesome so very very cool

00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:47,599
however in the future down the road

00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:49,849
we're hoping eventually to go more where

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,260
Laura's which is with Apollo kind of

00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:53,930
taking care of things you can use it

00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,809
with my back state tree and it's a

00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,099
pretty fantastic way to go I go throw

00:38:55,809 --> 00:39:03,260
Michelle you can make that that check

00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:04,789
payable to Jimin Holmgren yeah so what

00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,190
do you got while we're doing audience

00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:11,440
pulling of state management libraries

00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:15,910
how many people use a relay okay I do

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,910
some Facebook employees raise their hand

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,650
we're pretty biased but we've been

00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:25,000
really happy with that so

00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:26,289
uh this is kind of just a follow-on

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,630
question and I don't mean to put you on

00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:30,279
the spot because I know that that's a

00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,650
mean thing to do but why do you think

00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:35,010
that relay hasn't caught on the way that

00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,940
other state management libraries have

00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,079
you know and I'm asking that from a

00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,650
place where I'm actually biased because

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,779
we use relay under the hood at Gatsby

00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,789
so I like it I'm just I'm just kind of

00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:47,680
curious what you think is there I'm

00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:50,950
really nervous to offend the relay team

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:56,410
who's not here and I'm not on it but we

00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:59,529
could cut the camera ah my intuition

00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:02,140
says that we've needed to focus relay

00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:03,970
and most of our work has been done to

00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:07,329
make relay support the things that we've

00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:10,410
needed at Facebook and other state

00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:12,579
management libraries have been mostly

00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,940
let's support the community and let's

00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,990
build this for the community whereas

00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,329
relay has been like okay we need this

00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:21,819
for Facebook this is clearly valuable

00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:24,730
for everybody else one of the things

00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:27,010
that's really cool for relay announced

00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:31,029
at f8 was this thing that we're doing

00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:33,579
for facebook.com which you should watch

00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:35,920
the f8 announcement if you haven't seen

00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:38,950
that we're rewriting facebook.com with

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,140
react relay in graphs QL and one of the

00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:44,559
cool things that's coming in relay is

00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,750
called data-driven dependencies and the

00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:50,770
problem that we're solving is you have

00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:53,049
the feed news feed for facebook.com/ and

00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,210
there's like a hundred different things

00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:58,329
that you might need to render and graph

00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,710
QL responds with like four of them and

00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:01,510
that's what is in your feed but your

00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:05,920
bundle needs to have the rendering code

00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:07,240
for all of them that's huge and so did

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,140
of different dependencies enables you to

00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:13,500
send down what kind of dependent what

00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,849
kind of feed story this is and what

00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,589
JavaScript module you use to render it

00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:19,119
and then we use that for but with bundle

00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:21,730
splitting to only load the ones that are

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,859
necessary and it's like way faster

00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,150
smaller bundles really cool stuff but

00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:27,940
like that's the kind of thing that we're

00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:31,390
building in relay because we need it for

00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:33,710
the kind of projects that we build that

00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:38,300
seems relevant to my interest

00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:39,950
okay so this question was fed to me by

00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,120
Gant Laborde so I don't actually know

00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,910
what it means

00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,640
let me just read it word for word do you

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:52,670
think we finally started calming down

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:56,480
with our navigation libraries anyone

00:41:52,670 --> 00:42:00,710
know nobody's going to touch that I love

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,410
to you day every time he's like I I

00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:05,750
think that the the community has started

00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,430
to solidify on something somebody

00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,780
backstage was just showing me some

00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:13,010
amazing gesture handlers that were built

00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,600
and I think that's one of the pain

00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:17,330
points of navigation libraries over the

00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,610
years is that keeping things smooth at

00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:22,040
60fps like they used to be in the old

00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:26,510
school days of iOS apps being built on

00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:30,350
objective-c you know 2012 era I think

00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:32,140
that the solutions are coming and in my

00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:34,640
perspective is essentially I think all

00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,560
all mobile apps needs some sort of

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,930
navigation structure and so I would like

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,610
there to be one solution that was driven

00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:42,500
and that's because I've had Apple who's

00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:46,280
been doing that for me for many years

00:42:42,500 --> 00:43:00,770
and doing that does have its trade-offs

00:42:46,280 --> 00:43:05,150
you know yeah so I think so I actually

00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:09,440
wrote a navigation library in native

00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:11,660
code prior to adopting react native and

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,870
and it was built on the native api's

00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,340
that are really good really good but

00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:18,050
there's still that separation between

00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,670
the JavaScript side and the native side

00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,470
that makes things a little difficult you

00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:27,710
can't just use them directly as much as

00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:30,770
you might want to and so the the other

00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,880
well a few months ago I tweeted somebody

00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:35,390
talked me out of writing another

00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,370
navigation library and they baited

00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:41,290
everybody on Twitter

00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:41,290
[Laughter]

00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:46,060
like what have you done anything with

00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:48,580
navigation as you've been building not a

00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:50,800
ton to be perfectly honest and because I

00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,500
am super new like I honestly didn't know

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,210
that large influx of navigation

00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,740
libraries was like a thing which I feel

00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:59,530
like Eli the other night was like that's

00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,000
actually comforting to hear so so yeah

00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:03,370
it hasn't been something super on my

00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,840
radar so I've kind of been like learning

00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:09,670
more about that as that question came up

00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,110
have you run into problems with with

00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:15,070
navigation libraries or does that's kind

00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:19,330
of like a solve problem in yeah I I

00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:24,130
think yes I have I'm I've used reactive

00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:25,690
navigation and yeah I mean it's I think

00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:28,330
the question is are we settling down I

00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:31,060
feel like we are over the past two years

00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,800
I think it hasn't like it's clear they

00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,600
suggest too and so there's some

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,790
direction it might be nice to have a

00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,500
little bit to have it easier for people

00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:41,020
to understand what trade-offs are

00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,840
between the two but yeah it does feel

00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:45,850
like it's um it's settling down and

00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,190
there's still a couple of like pain

00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,410
points that I've experienced so I'm

00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:55,030
looking forward to continuous

00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:56,530
improvement do you have an opinion here

00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:58,090
is this one of those things you have to

00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:06,160
like stand on the side door we're

00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:07,720
Switzerland okay so this one I'm hoping

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,600
that somebody has a strong opinion here

00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:14,110
because you all really let me down with

00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:16,870
the state the state management so let's

00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:19,440
let's let's TF JavaScript typescript and

00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,440
reason and

00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:35,820
[Applause]

00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:42,090
or flow and tell us which one you prefer

00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:43,830
and if I may so I'll be the first to

00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:47,000
admit I've not used reason so I can't

00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:50,010
speak to that but as a new developer I

00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,840
have had the best time using JavaScript

00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,520
and I think the reason for that is

00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,650
because with the introduction of

00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,650
typescript if you are a newer developer

00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,240
it's this whole other level of errors

00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:03,960
that you're dealing with that take you a

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,730
little bit farther away from the code

00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,100
that you're writing because it's so

00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,990
focused on the types so I think if I

00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,210
were trying to learn JavaScript and

00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:15,570
starting with typescript it would have

00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:16,950
been very very painful so I really

00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,320
appreciate the flexibility that

00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,990
JavaScript gives you particularly as a

00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,030
beginner that said now that I am working

00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,380
on a team and I've got bigger teams I'm

00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,150
working with and we're doing production

00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,740
work I think having typescript is

00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:31,740
actually really helpful because it does

00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:34,500
give the team kind of more information

00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:36,660
about the code without actually having

00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:40,020
to physically communicate with each

00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:42,720
other about that so from a barrier to

00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,580
entry level I'm all team JavaScript but

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,140
from a like yeah you're working on a big

00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:49,680
team like typescript

00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:52,170
totally makes sense it's interesting

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,060
because that's actually but the the path

00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,820
that we took when we switch to react

00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,860
native back in 2015 it was amazing we

00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:02,070
were able to fix bugs in production

00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:03,810
almost instantly but we were we were a

00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,730
little bit worried about the the tooling

00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,470
at the time and so we we decided that

00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:09,720
you know I missed types

00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:13,110
I miss my compiler and I missed types so

00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:15,480
much but we've been on JavaScript since

00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:18,360
the early days because of the barrier to

00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,460
entry to typescript we're actually over

00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,110
the next month or two my entire team is

00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,970
going to be learning typescript and

00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:26,970
we'll decide as a group if that's where

00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:28,620
we want to go for the future our full

00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:30,210
stack web team is already switched

00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:33,180
entirely to typescript through the react

00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:36,470
work that they do so bringing types into

00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:41,269
JavaScript right now we do use flow

00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:47,839
but unfortunately it's not used a lot we

00:47:41,269 --> 00:47:49,400
use it but only a little bit say no hot

00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:53,059
and like come on somebody's gotta have a

00:47:49,400 --> 00:48:00,019
hot date here I can I make everybody mad

00:47:53,059 --> 00:48:09,460
yes so I like typescript but I like to

00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:14,539
use typescript with any so I do not yes

00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:15,920
so so so I make the JavaScript people

00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:17,119
mad because I'm using typescript and

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,009
then I make the typescript people mad

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:25,549
because I'm using any so you only use

00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:29,470
any question that's actually the

00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:29,470
infinite redfork is called yolo scrip

00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:38,869
yeah no I so I'm happy to talk more

00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:44,359
about it afterward to let other people

00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:45,009
thought we need to know okay okay okay

00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:49,130
okay

00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:52,160
all right so I love what typescript

00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,720
brings you from you know implicit types

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,369
where it's it's you know it's kind of

00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:59,029
detecting what you're trying to do and

00:48:55,369 --> 00:49:04,670
giving you its best guess about what's

00:48:59,029 --> 00:49:08,720
the word I'm looking for inference thank

00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:11,390
you yes type inference and so that's

00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,460
amazing like I converted over glue gun

00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:17,150
which is a library that I maintain for

00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:20,390
CL eyes I converted over to typescript

00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:22,130
and like just changing js2 ts gave me a

00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,500
whole bunch right like that was amazing

00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:26,089
and there's some situations where my

00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,700
typescript knowledge wasn't good enough

00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:30,109
to write the types like I didn't know

00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:33,410
how to do that so I just write as any

00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:35,359
and guess what I can do JavaScript so I

00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:36,920
could I can figure it out right like

00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,289
even if it's as any I can probably

00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,329
figure out how to write this code but

00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:43,069
then where where typescript was giving

00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:44,660
me all that all of its benefits I was it

00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:46,130
was it was more like like like some

00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,599
people are very much strict typescript

00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,200
no like you if you if it's not correct

00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,570
then you're not getting benefit my

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,820
understand that take but I'm looking at

00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:55,200
this is JavaScript plus like I got I

00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,910
have JavaScript now I have JavaScript

00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,800
plus something else and it's it's

00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:01,680
bringing me closer to that ideal so

00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,810
that's where I'm coming from and I do

00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:07,010
love typescript though almost everything

00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:07,010
I'm writing these days is such good

00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:14,550
those are like the exact opposite trade

00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:16,260
offs for us at Facebook I think the one

00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:18,630
of the things that people often look at

00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,560
typescript and flow and all these kind

00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:20,540
of things is for the developer

00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,700
experience to be able to have

00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:27,030
autocomplete and all that and I think

00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,829
Facebook's at least the Facebook the

00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:30,390
Facebook product teams that I've worked

00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:34,740
with I can't speak there's a lot of

00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:41,700
people who work at Facebook we care a

00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:44,910
lot about runtime like accuracy that if

00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:48,420
this code is typed there are not runtime

00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:49,410
exceptions in prod and some of the

00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,420
trade-offs that we've made have meant

00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:53,550
that it's been hard to get like

00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:57,480
autocomplete and like the niceties but

00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:59,400
we have focused a lot on that so very

00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:03,510
different to then go for the NES and

00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:08,369
embrace them is anybody using reason has

00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:09,810
anybody use reason no I haven't used it

00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:12,960
at all but I definitely have a few

00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:15,420
friends who are like into reason like

00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,190
that's so fine a next-level typescript

00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,750
this is actually what I'm starting to

00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:20,730
suspect I don't think anybody actually

00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:22,840
does reason I think everybody just knows

00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:27,700
somebody who writes reason

00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:33,640
so who uses reason so you alright call

00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:37,930
stop Facebook uses it because we build

00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:40,120
it but I mean I think it's it's a great

00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:42,730
thing to see where that's gonna lead in

00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,170
the ecosystem yeah I'm actually very

00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:45,520
excited about reason I think it's really

00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:47,050
cool I just I could never find anybody

00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,400
to like tell me what it does because

00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:52,590
they're like well I haven't personally

00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:56,320
written any reason but it seems exciting

00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:59,080
which is exactly how I feel about it

00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:02,170
okay so I have officially run out of

00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:04,870
questions so at this point I'm going to

00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:06,190
open the floor for the panelists if you

00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:07,990
have any follow ons because I feel like

00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:12,490
we had a lot of things that we wanted to

00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:18,730
dive into you had you you've been giving

00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:20,380
me the eyes I can go just a little bit

00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,900
for life I actually like to hear from

00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:27,010
the rest with the introduction of the

00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:29,590
new JavaScript engine Hermes

00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:31,480
that's shipping byte code that's not

00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:33,910
shipping JavaScript that's shipping byte

00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:36,610
code so does that mean that now we can

00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:38,320
just you know like write compilers for a

00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:43,210
bunch of different languages and use

00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:52,660
whatever we want what is this Hermes

00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:56,320
thing I think we're focused on

00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:59,860
JavaScript there were not planning on

00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:01,570
doing anything other than that but

00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:04,060
making JavaScript and all of your apps

00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:06,130
fast without having you needing to make

00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:10,600
changes is kind of the goal there that's

00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:12,580
the sound of an NDA in action that's the

00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,980
sound of the entire Hermes team sitting

00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:18,250
here looking at me being like I don't

00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:23,200
know what you're gonna say just like

00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:24,490
don't all right so with that I think

00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,820
we're gonna wrap it up thank you so much

00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:41,590
to the panelists for coming out really

00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:41,590
