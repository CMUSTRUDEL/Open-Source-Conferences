Title: Chain React 2019 - Jenn Robison - Building & Deploying Demos with Bitrise & Appetize.io
Publication date: 2019-08-06
Playlist: Chain React 2019
Description: 
	Have you ever wanted to allow someone to provide feedback on your application without installing the package? Maybe you need to provide customer support for different devices. Bitrise is a pipeline tool that will pull from your repository and has multiple configurations that allow you to build for different purposes. One purpose is deploying to Appetize.io which allows for a fully interactive version of your application on multiple devices and platforms without much effort. This has allowed us to train our support reps, but also allow them to walk through a trouble ticket with users on the fly.
In this session I will demonstrate a basic setup of Bitrise to build the application for both iOS and Android platforms, with a deployment to Appetize for both versions.

	00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,179
hi everybody I'm so happy to be here

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,580
really wanted to come last year and we

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,949
didn't get the opportunity but I'm so

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,630
excited for sharing everything I've

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:26,010
learned in this last year especially

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,510
about bit rise and appetizers I owe so

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,990
I'm gonna go over a little bit about

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,170
what bit rise is and the benefits to

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,329
using it as well as appetizers IO and

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,899
how you can benefit from that with your

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,640
react native applications so there is

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,739
obviously some assumption you are

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,910
familiar with react native I think a lot

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,430
of that here today

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:52,050
it's not super important for what I'm

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,579
covering right now but there is that so

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,680
a little bit more about me

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,640
he shared I ride a Harley yeah I ride a

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,350
Street Bob pretty cool obviously I'm an

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,400
engineer I feel like I'm a forever

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,890
student I'm also a firefighter and EMT a

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,150
wife I have these three really awesome

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,560
kids that are really active I attend the

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,770
local football games it's actually a

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:22,680
picture of my daughter and I so just a

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,939
few things about me so--but rise it's a

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,200
continuous integration and delivery

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:31,560
platform but they really focus on mobile

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,170
specific and that's really helpful in

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,829
this space there are other you know CI

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,380
CD platforms that attempt to solve for

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:43,320
too many platforms which make it more

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,970
complex it allows also for the

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,920
automation of your testing and

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,780
deployment of your app with a really

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,990
simple interface which we'll get into in

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:56,700
a little bit so appetize IO this allows

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,939
you to run your native mobile

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,710
application Android and iOS in a web

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:07,649
browser so we've seen a couple examples

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:08,789
today with like expo snack we I'm trying

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,599
to think of one of the other ones we saw

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,810
but this is just a tool you can use for

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,260
app demos train

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,630
customer support development testing

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,930
there's you know endless opportunities

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:25,420
for how you could use this

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:29,110
so my geeky humor will get into the nuts

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:35,110
and bolts here I'm a farm girl I grew up

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:37,360
in the country built engines so we'll go

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,430
a little bit into just in the slides and

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,760
then I'll actually demonstrate in the

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,830
application so when you want to put your

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,500
application in bit rise there are some

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,900
really simple steps you set your privacy

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,310
you connect your repository whether

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:57,580
that's gate lab github bitbucket etc and

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,920
you set up the access private-public you

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,560
choose the branch you want to set for

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,130
that configuration and then you do some

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,549
simple validation when it's doing that

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,650
validation it's getting some project

00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,540
specific information so in this case

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,760
it'll start to see like it's a react

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,730
native project oh you have iOS in there

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,040
you have Android in there which will

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:25,590
start to build out the baseline

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,570
configuration in the workflow editor

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,459
once you get through that it's

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:34,750
automatically detecting a lot of the

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:36,400
values for you and you can set it I con

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,769
which will help you in your dashboard so

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,079
if you have different configurations for

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,120
your app one on your development branch

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,430
one on your production branch because

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,600
again you can use this to deploy to the

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:51,280
App Store to run your tests etc then you

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,470
can register web hooks which allow you

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:59,650
to automatically trigger these workflows

00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:01,989
to happen with that it sets off your

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:11,889
first build so let's go ahead and do

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:14,200
that I'm still a PC girl I'm definitely

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,150
not one of those Mac girls mmm so it's a

00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,700
really simple hello world react native

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,400
app I pretty much did a react native in

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:25,780
it and got a simple react native

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:28,750
application going for this purpose so

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,750
here's that

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,480
I already had done a demo so you can see

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:38,380
this is kind of my dashboard and I'm

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:42,970
gonna go in and add a new application um

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:45,970
so I've already connected my my private

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:49,450
github repository or my github account

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,880
in bit rise for this example so it's

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,590
already done that portion of it and you

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,350
do that when you create the bit rise

00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:01,540
account so I'm going to say I want this

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:03,550
app to be private again next like oh

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,550
yeah I'm gonna keep it on github it

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:10,660
knows my repos I'm gonna select my help

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,730
hello world setting my repository access

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:17,590
automatically I'm like I don't need any

00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:20,410
other private stuff so auto add wants my

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,680
branch name so again this could be you

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:27,720
know UAT testing production whatever you

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,720
have this one only has a master branch

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,640
starting to do that validation I like

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,140
how tells you you might want to take a

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,840
coffee break it actually doesn't take

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:41,190
too long but um you can see here it's

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:45,340
starting to run blogs we can expand it

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:48,970
it's doing its you know CLI we can tail

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,490
it so it's running the project scanner

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,940
right now you'll start to see it's

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:57,280
detected an iOS project it's detected in

00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:05,850
the Android project it knows it was

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:05,850
react native let it finish this portion

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:16,880
all right so you can see here it's like

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,310
hey you have a react native project for

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,160
my android project yep I want it to stay

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:26,060
in the Android project directory my

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:30,260
module for that is app and I can go

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:33,230
ahead and go next I don't have any

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,880
variants I want to set on here then it's

00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,270
asking me a little bit about my iOS

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,639
project so I'm going to select my schema

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,100
here so again if you have you know

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,080
different schemas so for an example in

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,150
the project that I'm working on we have

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,070
one that's for dev we have one that's

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:53,120
for demo and we have one that's for

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:56,660
production I'm going to do this for

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,390
development so this is all the

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:06,590
configuration here and I'm just going to

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:14,810
confirm it gonna quickly browse for an

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:19,490
icon just something fun

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:23,860
wish we had more sunshine last week I'm

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:26,360
a native here so I go ahead and proceed

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,880
and again you could have different

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,440
images that will help you realize in

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,840
your dashboard which app you're looking

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,400
at so if the builds failing the emails

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,640
that you get or however you set up for

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,720
the communication at the end so I'm

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,470
going to go ahead and register that

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,570
webhook so as I you know commit to my

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,820
repository it will actually kick off

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,620
those builds so as I was showing you in

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,960
the slides it's really as simple as ah

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,000
that's your basic configuration it did

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,340
most of it for me kind of reminds me of

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,870
the days of you know front page WYSIWYG

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:04,669
editors so back over here in our

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:08,229
dashboard you can see it's doing its

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:11,210
thing it's running I can click in there

00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:15,380
and the whole time it's running I can

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:18,950
actually again look through and follow

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:21,800
what it's doing each step I can see each

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,760
step it's doing if it fails you know I

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,140
see everything as

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:34,760
it was in the terminal I'm gonna flip

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:36,650
back over to my presentation here so as

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,930
I said you can get into now more

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:42,110
advanced configurations so you can set

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:45,380
up specific steps for react native for

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:50,000
iOS for Android for adding appetize

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:53,570
which we'll get into as well so there's

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
a really simple interface or you can

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,160
download the amyl file and start doing

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,200
your configurations directly in the

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,790
gamal so this is what the workflow

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,370
editor looks like and I'll actually go

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:09,950
in there and show you there's a ton of

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,350
options you can search by categories

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,360
like oh I'm looking for Android specific

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:18,860
I'm looking for the build I'm looking

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:32,600
for the iOS test pieces so let's flip

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:39,800
back over to Chrome here and we will go

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:41,900
into the workflow editor so this is the

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,170
visual representation of what it's doing

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,840
it's activating the SSH key its cloning

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,960
the repository it has again this is

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:54,320
really just a skeleton that it's set for

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,210
you to understand what you can do run

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,520
NPM commands and then it does this

00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,440
deploy two-bit rise which is taking your

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:07,100
artifacts and storing them for that

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:10,580
build back over here I want to show you

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,530
so if I wanted to add a step I can add

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,570
it anywhere in there so I just click

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:19,370
that plus icon I can start to have

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:22,390
branching logic and I'm gonna say oh you

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:26,480
can start to see like there's appetize

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:28,760
android and i could say oh i want it for

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,910
tests and it starts to give you all

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,020
these options you click on it it adds it

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,710
where you wanted it

00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:39,040
you fill out a couple variables

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:41,589
save it and you can run it so I'm going

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,480
to discard that and show you the yamo

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:49,149
file so this is your source of truth of

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,120
the visual representation right in the

00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:56,140
amel format so I can start to get into

00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:00,850
exact configurations that I want if I

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:05,589
don't want to use that WYSIWYG editor so

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:07,810
I'm gonna go ahead and copy my bit rosy

00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:10,570
I'm only have over here so one thing to

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,520
note about the amel is that if you check

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,310
it in with your repository it doesn't

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,700
actually run that that's more for your

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,010
purposes you have to save it within bit

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:27,060
rise or it doesn't realize you want it

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:31,270
to be different so I've made that change

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:35,250
so that's just an example of changing

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:39,190
the yamo here and then I can go back to

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:46,690
this application and say hey kick off my

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:49,180
new build and it will start so this one

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,080
takes a little bit longer so as it's

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:56,430
running

00:11:50,080 --> 00:12:01,660
I'll get back into the slides over here

00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:04,410
so appetize as I was talking about this

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,720
is a really great tool for doing

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,550
demonstrations you know you want to sell

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,920
your product you want to train somebody

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,470
on it I'm in our case we're using it for

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,209
customer support so our CSPs can

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,890
actually have a version of the

00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,420
application and walk the users through

00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,779
different functionality they can log

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:26,230
into it so for this one you set up the

00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:28,270
account on appetize they have varying

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,760
levels you know I'm not paid by appetize

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:34,959
by any means and they have you know

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,690
enterprise support or very basic you

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,339
would request your API token which you

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,070
then need to set into the bit right

00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:45,420
secrets manager and use the workflow

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:49,010
editor or the bit Rhys Nemo in order to

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:54,310
run those builds with the

00:12:49,010 --> 00:13:00,740
to appetize so get back over here

00:12:54,310 --> 00:13:02,899
and walk through that piece so here in

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,810
the docs it's they make it really simple

00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:08,360
to request the API token you click this

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:13,730
they email it to you however you set up

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,889
your account in the workflow editor so

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,870
this build has now passed for the

00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:22,310
changes we made I'm going to go back

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:27,199
into the workflow editor and show you

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:30,290
the secrets so in here is where you can

00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:33,260
add your secrets so you would add new

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:40,300
and you would name it whatever you want

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:47,630
to call it so in my case I have it named

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:51,670
bit rise API token sorry the whole

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,670
mirroring just messing me up

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:03,460
and then you would paste in your value

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:06,790
here you would then be able to run your

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,340
build once again I'm gonna go ahead and

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:13,810
cancel that I don't have the API token

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:17,380
right there but locally a really cool

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:24,750
thing is they have this available for

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:24,750
you they have a COI

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,950
that allows you in your terminal to run

00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,540
the same thing but it runs much faster

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,160
so you can start tweaking your Yama file

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,350
obviously you don't have the same

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,570
workflow editor with that WYSIWYG

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,010
drag-and-drop but you can go look at

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,660
what the steps are what the

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,730
configurations are they actually have

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,790
really great documentation for all of

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:51,580
the various steps but it allows you to

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:55,110
get really quick feedback and debug why

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:57,730
a particular step might not be working

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,300
so let me go ahead and show you that in

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,300
terminal

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:15,640
so I have in just do a coat here this is

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,710
the the workflow we just ran and I have

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,770
a couple of the other steps commented

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:25,180
out for for time they take a little

00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:29,950
longer like Xcode archived and I'm only

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:31,840
going to deploy to iOS but I do have to

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,360
set a bit right secrets

00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:38,080
yamo file as well in order to do two

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:42,490
appetize deployment from local it needs

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:45,730
the same setup and this primary workflow

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,770
or this the workflow is called primary

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,300
in this case that's their default naming

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,550
conventions I could call it whatever I

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,460
want I could call it deployment I could

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,460
call it test you can see here in my

00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:01,630
setup

00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:06,940
so here's primary and then I have in

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:09,190
here deploy and it has four primary

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,370
before it runs it's doing the setup

00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:14,320
workflow and after it's doing the deploy

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,320
workflow so you can start to have that

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,810
branching logic of like one Yama file if

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,600
you want and that you're working off of

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:26,680
and then running or executing just

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:31,210
certain pieces of it so over here the

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,400
command is just bit rise run and then

00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:44,500
the name of the workflow that you want

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:46,690
to run so you can start to see again

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,370
it's just going through this looks

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:52,360
exactly like what you were seeing in the

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:56,710
tailing in the bit or yeah in the bit

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,690
rise dashboard so it cloned which

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:02,140
doesn't do locally because it knows it's

00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,930
working off of your local branch so

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,240
again this is a way to test changes

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:11,890
without going through the actual push to

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:15,010
your repository so now it's actually

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,950
spinning up the emulator because it's

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,080
doing the build for iOS

00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:25,210
which it will then take those artifacts

00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:33,610
in order to run the the deployment up

00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:36,790
two-bit appetize so it created a zip its

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,530
deployed two-bit rise and appetize so

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,230
now it's it's letting me know all the

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:47,530
steps that ran how long they took and

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:53,560
that they passed so in this final

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:56,590
section here this is kind of the the two

00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:59,370
versions so over over here on the

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:03,100
left-hand side of that image you can see

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:05,110
the Android emulator and then an iOS

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,060
emulator these are both done in the

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,980
website and I'll show you them in just a

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,960
moment but you can see there's a lot of

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,880
different options I can you know make it

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,010
bigger or smaller I can rotate the

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,230
screen I can change which device it's

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,340
running off of I can do silly things

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,780
like you know change the bezel color and

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,470
these are all four you can actually

00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:29,860
embed these in iframes on a website so

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:32,650
if you wanted to have you know in your

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,470
repository in your documentation however

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:38,320
it is you want you actually can

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,180
configure the URL for a frame in order

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,910
to be able to pass the parameters the

00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:46,470
specific parameters you want without

00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:56,590
allowing the user to interact with that

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:58,950
so going back maybe sorry one screen to

00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,950
the other

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,060
so we'll go back to my dashboard for

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:11,550
this account and you can see it's

00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:13,620
uploaded both the iOS and the Android

00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,030
version so this morning I ran it and I

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,280
did the Android version so you can see

00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,290
it was updated at 6:30 this morning that

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,610
was the sixth time that I've done that

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:25,710
and in this other one it was just ran

00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,050
that was the 16th time because I've been

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:31,260
running this mostly for iOS first speed

00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:34,770
and the way I was able to get that to

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,590
continually update was back actually in

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:43,830
that configuration again if I do not

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:46,620
specify in that step the public key so

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:52,140
you'll notice this key actually matches

00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:54,630
to the key that is right here and that

00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,940
tells it to like update that specific

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,920
one if I don't provide that it will

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,140
still upload to my account because I've

00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,450
given it that API token but it will

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,210
create a new version of your application

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,410
every time which there would be some

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,390
cases where you might want to do that

00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,180
right you might want it to upload for a

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:14,180
new release candidate or something of

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,160
that sort

00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:20,490
so let's actually take a look at what it

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,740
looks like so this is what I just

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:26,400
deployed okay so this is a react native

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,250
an it so it has all the you know tells

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,010
you to shake it for your dev tools so

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:39,300
when I tap to play it's installing the

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:42,600
app and that's it so I wanted to show

00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:47,250
you actually and this is how we're kind

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:50,010
of using it at my company so we have it

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:52,500
knows our icon because it's pulling that

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:55,320
again from the application that wasn't

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,840
something we specifically configured you

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,390
can see this is the iOS version and then

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,310
we have our Android version and it's got

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,310
some other tagging and various things

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:12,240
really that was all I had to share with

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,669
you I think both of those tools allow

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,779
you to you know give your customers a

00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:18,749
great experience whether that's for

00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,669
selling for training for support for

00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:22,409
debugging just to see what it looks like

00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:24,620
in different devices those are really

00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:28,350
quick ways and then the CI and

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:31,900
continuous delivery thank you

00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:45,209
[Applause]
