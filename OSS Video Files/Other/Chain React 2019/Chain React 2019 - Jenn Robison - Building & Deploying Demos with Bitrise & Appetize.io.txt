Title: Chain React 2019 - Jenn Robison - Building & Deploying Demos with Bitrise & Appetize.io

Description: 
	Have you ever wanted to allow someone to provide feedback on your application without installing the package? Maybe you need to provide customer support for different devices. Bitrise is a pipeline tool that will pull from your repository and has multiple configurations that allow you to build for different purposes. One purpose is deploying to Appetize.io which allows for a fully interactive version of your application on multiple devices and platforms without much effort. This has allowed us to train our support reps, but also allow them to walk through a trouble ticket with users on the fly.
In this session I will demonstrate a basic setup of Bitrise to build the application for both iOS and Android platforms, with a deployment to Appetize for both versions.
