Title: Chain React 2019 - Ankita Kulkarni - Beyond the React Native Benchmark
Publication date: 2019-08-06
Playlist: Chain React 2019
Description: 
	While building a React Native app, you should think of scalability from the get-go. A native mobile app goes through a lot of different phases - deployment, internalization, component practices, handling assets, offline support, complex animations and a lot more. In this talk, I will go through some of the best practices you should consider from setting up a project, challenges most react native app faces to scalability. At the end of this talk, you will go home with practices you can apply to your projects and feel more confident doing so. ğŸš€

	00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:16,500
so before I get started I was actually

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,810
told to like do some little bit of

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,730
entertainment just because it's the talk

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,550
is right before lunch so I was asked to

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,830
take a selfie with everyone so I want

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,359
you all to just do whatever whoohoo

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,689
whatever and I'm just gonna take a

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,059
selfie just because I was asked to take

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,559
to capture all your faces right before

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,559
lunch because I know you are all hungry

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:46,710
okay is everyone ready can I get a

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:51,090
little bit more enthusiasm ready yeah

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:57,390
one two three okay awesome

00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:00,629
I'm done okay so my topic for today is

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,340
beyond the react native benchmark okay

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,680
so my name is Anne Kira I'm a Solutions

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,689
Architect at wrangle IO rango IO is

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,900
essentially a software consulting firm

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,549
based out of Toronto as I mentioned my

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,890
talk is beyond the react native

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,170
benchmarks I'm going to talk a lot more

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,979
on like what goes on when a project get

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,750
started to like going to production so

00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:23,850
when an app is small we can manage it

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,189
very easily just because it's small and

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,680
when it when it grows that's when you

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,509
got to really think about scalability

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,229
but when I think about scalability it's

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,939
like there's a lot that goes on like you

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,040
have to take it do like consider

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,930
scalability every step of the way so a

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,939
lot of the architectural decisions that

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,399
we need to take just to make sure that

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,340
your app can scale well and when you

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,170
onboard new developers or work with

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,850
different clients it becomes even more

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,890
important that you know a lot of the

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,470
best practices embedded in a react

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,259
native project so I'm going to talk

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,750
about some of the things that I consider

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,280
when I'm working on a project but also

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,890
like how to avoid some of the common

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,960
challenges that I've faced since I

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,209
started working with react native just

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,370
to give a little bit of my ground I was

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,260
also a native developer before and I

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,480
wanted to like stick with JavaScript and

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,940
that's

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,700
why I quickly switched to react native

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:22,349
and that's why I feel like just native

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,349
and react native works like really well

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,120
alright so how many of you are working

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,519
towards are already have apps in the App

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,330
Store please raise your hand that's

00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,040
awesome

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,420
I wasn't expecting so many hands but

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,459
that's great

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,049
so what you're gonna do is I'm gonna

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,610
take you on a project journey from

00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:41,379
different sides of the project right

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,540
first we are gonna talk about like

00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:45,310
different perspectives so like from a

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,110
project perspective from a components

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,610
perspective from design perspective and

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:54,670
finally from the release submission

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:58,930
perspective I know that's skewed so

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,370
that's so from a project perspective so

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,620
the first thing that we really need to

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,579
consider is like bootstrapping a project

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,290
itself and when I think of this for me

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:11,319
like there are cons like mainly like two

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,170
ways and this is the this screenshot is

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,730
from the react native Docs itself say if

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,880
you just google react native getting

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,250
started these dogs will pop-up so one

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,639
way is the expose CLI way and the other

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,519
one is a react native CLI way I love

00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,560
Expo I really love the tool like snack

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,450
as well just because I can like get

00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,819
prototype in like get started with like

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,120
prototyping like right off the bat it's

00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:39,130
it's great for like apps I personally

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,620
had never released an app to production

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,470
with Expo so I'm not gonna talk a lot

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,150
about Expo but I what I like about the

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,400
react native CLI is that it gives me

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,120
access to the Android and iOS folders

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,870
right away so I can just get started

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,060
personally when I'm working with clients

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,000
it gets a little bit of a little bit

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,959
risky just to like tell them to like go

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,609
for expo and like go like scale their

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,440
app but essentially with react native

00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:09,849
CLI if you have several apps in the App

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,849
Store and it has worked really well next

00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:14,859
thing is the directory structure so now

00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:16,599
that we actually install the app like

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,099
using the react native CLI and whatnot

00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,989
this is kind of like the directory

00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:22,300
structure that I like to follow so

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,280
having like abjure as iOS Android which

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,650
is like pretty standard but also like

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,190
having a source folder with screens in

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,190
it

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,180
so what we typically like to do is

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,490
essentially let's say you have a login

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,310
screen which a lot of apps do if you do

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,290
have login what I would like to do is

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,820
just like build start building features

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,670
based on the screens that you are

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,410
focusing on so in this case like any

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,810
having an indexed or J's file

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,400
referencing all the other files actions

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,810
epics reduce your selectors if you're

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,480
not using Redux or any sort of

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,180
middleware also having a common folder

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,830
with just like modules and I talked a

00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,170
little bit about vertical slicing in a

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,880
bit but I also having a components

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,370
folder which is like essentially all the

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,710
common components such as stacks buttons

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:09,220
and so on and storage again everything

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:13,540
Redux and this really helps structure

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:16,390
the project a lot better I also find

00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,310
that in terms of like if your newest

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,470
mini app is small you can start with

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,050
this and slowly scale up right you don't

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,060
have to like have this like really ideal

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,460
project structure from the get-go

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,660
because every team is different and even

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,520
though we have tried to take like

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,880
specific actions just to make sure that

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,100
all our our app is like AB structure is

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,480
ideal we always have to iterate and we

00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,890
always have to change so keep that in

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,640
mind when you're thinking of like

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:45,040
directory structure in general adding a

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,960
package.json to the root dealer root

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,230
level directory structure so your inputs

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,780
look you know much normal I would say

00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,940
then like just going back one directory

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,580
every time and this really helps to like

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,220
its look makes it look a lot cleaner as

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,710
well

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,080
next thing is routing selecting the

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,480
navigation library is a very crucial

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,910
step in your apps development feed web

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,700
app order react native app so any

00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,250
decision needs to be made with like you

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,220
thought and care because scalability

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,100
factors in a lot with routing right

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,260
because as the app grows it's your

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,140
project is going to be in a huge mess if

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:29,500
the routing library that you pick is not

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:32,169
the right one for your project so my

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,500
favorite one is react navigation it's a

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:37,570
JavaScript based library expo also uses

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,800
react navigation which is great so a lot

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,719
of times when I do have to like

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,069
prototype or test something out if this

00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:43,749
actually going to work with the client

00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,249
that I'm working with I'd straight away

00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:47,919
go to Expo and then move to react knee

00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:50,379
to CLI and it really helped if the

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,389
documentation is awesome it does have

00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,039
like additional like modules for like

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,499
react native gesture handler and whatnot

00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,239
I have used react navigation in several

00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,789
projects and we have gone production and

00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:03,159
that we have scaled the app and I had I

00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:05,709
had never faced any issues I know that

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,259
obviously every library has its pros and

00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:10,299
cons and in terms of like performance

00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,610
itself like I did not see like we did

00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:16,779
not see any difference and like

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,729
performance essentially and a particular

00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:21,039
thing I loved about this library that it

00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:22,749
works in the concept of navigators just

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,149
because I'm coming from a native world

00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:27,550
everything is like a stack right and

00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:29,439
navigate navigators are essentially a

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,119
collection of different routes which

00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,860
really helps you to organize so let's

00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:34,959
say if you have a bunch of screens you

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,729
just use a stack night navigator and if

00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,129
you have a tab at the bottom of the app

00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:41,919
then essentially use a tab navigator and

00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:47,619
that really makes it easy to follow the

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:50,050
paradigm close to the native world so

00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:54,159
react native navigation so this library

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,929
is from vex and we did have a couple of

00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,639
projects that we use this library

00:07:55,929 --> 00:08:00,849
because the client had already adopted

00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,399
that the main challenge with this

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,319
specific library was that not a lot if

00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,149
not everyone on the team had the native

00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,909
knowledge and a lot of developers were

00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:12,610
pure JavaScript developers and when we

00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:14,409
were using this specific package we were

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,110
in the initial version of the app and

00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:18,849
then there was a major rewrite so we had

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,369
to literally spend about three weeks

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:23,469
migrating from the first version to the

00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:25,300
second and just because a lot of

00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,099
architectural decisions were change it

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:32,079
was it became a lot harder to like

00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:33,759
switch the documentation was okay just

00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:35,589
because if I wanted to look for

00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,689
something I had to like really dig up

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,519
and as this actually kind of tells me

00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:41,319
like how documentation is so important

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,559
especially when you're like adopting all

00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:47,410
these different libraries so instead of

00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,480
like building on top of like react

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,189
native bricks is actually building

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,269
everything from the ground up and the

00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:53,910
main difference between the two

00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,430
libraries is that it's using all the

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,540
of components we did see like the

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,330
gestures and stuff but definitely

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,710
smoother and stuff but again like it

00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,840
wasn't like that big of a difference

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,000
that I would spend so much time and

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,100
investment in the library and then the

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,220
developers are finding it really hard to

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,570
like adopt the library itself these are

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,770
some other challenges some of the things

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,940
we should consider have been very like

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,650
using routing or picking routing the

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,620
question I really like to ask the

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,600
clients is like do you have an existing

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,190
web app right because when we do

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,800
cup-like what I have noticed is that

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,540
when clients do come to like they like

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,790
they want to build an app it's mainly

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,890
because of push notifications just

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,170
because obviously everyone wants to

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,930
bother everyone with like notifications

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,200
like hey there's this new feature and

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:45,150
hey go check this out so most likely

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,830
they are going to have an existing web

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:50,220
app and I'm sure like we all do right

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,410
and in terms of the web app itself what

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,070
we like to do is extract the business

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:59,070
logic out business logic in a sense like

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,500
obviously the web app is converted into

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,240
a mobile app right the business logic is

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,960
essentially going to be the same and

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:11,520
it's going to be a lot more common so

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,560
essentially moving a business logic to a

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,800
utility library so just like create a

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,420
node module for it right and what and I

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,280
was asked this question this question is

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,440
so common and as like this question has

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,420
been asked so many times just like so

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,110
what how do you know what to move to a

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,970
utility library right so anything common

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,560
right so essentially like anything pure

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,960
functions anything that is not

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,820
specifically dependent on the web and it

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,980
can easily be moved to native and this

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,410
is very very important because if you

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,180
don't and like if you use like things

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,880
like the window object in the library

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,560
and that's the function you move through

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,480
the common library it's not gonna work

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,700
in native because there is no window and

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,700
all you have to like patch or like

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,290
polyfill stuff to keep that in mind the

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,660
other thing is like if you're using like

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,060
any state management such as such as

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,820
like redux or something like that I know

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,250
like obviously Redux follows the concept

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,410
of immutability right and a lot of the

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,179
functions are like pure functions

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,209
but I would personally like to keep the

00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,309
action and reduces separate from the web

00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:17,009
and mobile because if you think about it

00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:18,749
it gets really complex do you do we want

00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,489
every time the web team to meet the

00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:22,199
mobile team just to talk about one

00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:24,749
specific action so that we can move to a

00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:27,299
utility library it's a lot of like back

00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:28,709
and forth and just because web

00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,959
navigation is also going to be very

00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:33,089
different from the mobile navigation as

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,349
well so it's very important that to keep

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:36,059
these things in mind when you are

00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:38,159
thinking about the utility library

00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:41,699
itself so what were some of the

00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,439
challenges that I faced well a lot of

00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,539
shared context like made it really

00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:47,609
difficult to like share code so like

00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,989
essentially in terms of not just in them

00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:51,359
to the business logic but within the app

00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:53,489
itself just because we had so much

00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:56,189
shared context so such as like you're

00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:58,919
using a login right login or like

00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:00,899
specifically biometrics face ID touch ID

00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,470
if the app goes in the background you

00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:06,899
wonder you want they use we want to pop

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,679
out like the touch ID your face ID right

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:13,259
and in that case obviously that specific

00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:16,619
service is not common for like one

00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:18,149
screen it can be everywhere right that's

00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:19,829
why what we did was we started doing

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,559
like vertical slicing the module so like

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:25,350
any sort of like authentication

00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:28,199
biometrics any sort of like logout and

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:31,439
so on right and this really made it easy

00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:33,389
for us to like share code next let's

00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:36,329
talk about from a components perspective

00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:37,859
I mean react native is also react right

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:40,589
so when it comes to scalability

00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:42,329
obviously we got to think about from a

00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,369
components perspective as well like how

00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,569
do we want to handle components in

00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:48,269
general and how do we want to create

00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:53,459
components so first thing is

00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:55,919
translations first like just because I'm

00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,749
just gonna start with English because

00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,100
that's what everyone's familiar with but

00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:00,989
depending on the country you are in and

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,149
what's your first language it can vary

00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,799
right but at the same time when you're

00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,139
building all these components especially

00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,269
in a mobile app a lot of these

00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,519
components could be like related to text

00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:13,919
right such as like headlines and

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,639
captions and body text and whatnot it's

00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:20,880
very important to consider translations

00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:23,250
I really like this library call I 18

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,260
and ice and a previous speaker also like

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,970
mentioned something about that and which

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,010
is really great so essentially this is

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,600
like the code that looks like this is

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,520
how the code looks like for the headline

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
to component that we are using so we

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,740
have options for both because sometimes

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,990
we didn't want to translate specific tax

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,700
and sometimes we did want to so what we

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,140
did was we essentially created a

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,720
higher-order function called with

00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,610
translate and that takes in the headline

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,350
to component itself and depending on

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,150
like you want to translate or not it

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,960
will automatically decide and this is

00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:01,770
just like style components right and

00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,600
just like basic styling and CSS so yeah

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,190
so essentially like this is like a high

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,070
order component and this is how it looks

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,650
like hired a function essentially I'm

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,600
just calling IIT next or T giving it the

00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,280
key itself so when that from an API

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,590
perspective you're just passing in the

00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,270
text key from your locale and it's just

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,400
going to work and that really made it

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:24,390
easy because every time you wanted a

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:28,830
headline you looking component we can

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:30,750
just like use it directly so and also we

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,850
built a lot of common components up

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,610
front just so that we can use them

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:39,600
consistently so one of the popular ones

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,640
were scroll view right scroll view

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,950
because we had to be really needed to

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,810
consider how scrolling is going to

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,990
impact on a mobile app especially like

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:52,560
if your app wants to in terms of like

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:55,110
snapping or like you know specific like

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,910
list views tab views and so on it was

00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,590
very important to consider it so what we

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,480
did was we work with the designer to

00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,100
identify what the common scrolling

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,960
behavior is going to look like and

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,450
accordingly there's like essentially

00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,560
build a component that uses scroll view

00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,050
and added all these additional

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,790
properties to it to be honest scrolling

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,350
was so consistent like throughout the

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,180
app and it made it look really good

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,850
obviously there were like these edge

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,920
cases but it was fine

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,070
say if area view was another component

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,540
that we purchased because iPhones

00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,140
keyboard aware scroll view just because

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,970
obviously a lot of these apps also have

00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,410
forms right so how the different text

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,330
components are going to interact with

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,870
each other so if you have like two text

00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,150
boxes

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,730
how is it going to interact with like

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,370
when you hit next is it going to go to

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:45,540
the next Xbox or is it just going to

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,950
have press enter and so on and obviously

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,810
like these text components that I've

00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:53,010
been talking about such as headings body

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:55,380
captions and so on and form components

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,510
just because we had this one of the apps

00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,760
that we built had this huge sign like

00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,250
ten step sign-up process as part of it

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,460
all this like obviously sign up in walls

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,470
like adding text in an input and we

00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,830
build this input input text component

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:14,130
which essentially used forms like Redux

00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:16,080
forms and I know that wasn't the

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,720
recommendation from a previous speaker

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,710
from the previous presentation but we

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,690
use Redux forms on it but okay and also

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,910
like creating like common buttons as

00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,730
well

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:31,170
the other lesson I should say is that

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,150
develop Android and Apple at the same

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,760
time a lot of times we would get this

00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,760
pushback that no we only want to focus

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,280
on iOS no Android or the other way

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,630
around but when you're developing all

00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,480
these different components and you're

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:48,330
thinking of scalability most likely in

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,460
six months one of your stakeholder is

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,960
gonna be like can I have an Android

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,930
phone can i download this app and on an

00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,910
Android no you can't just because we

00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,000
built it for Apple

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:02,120
so essentially but if you think of like

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,580
development and design right consider

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,700
thinking of both those platforms apples

00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,500
has like their most strict in terms of

00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,900
like their submission process and they

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,580
have these like really detailed human

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,250
interface guidelines that you want to

00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,959
look at just because you're not gonna

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,360
accept approve your app if you don't

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,150
follow those so what we essentially did

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,470
was we usually go with apples human

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,720
interface guidelines just to make sure

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:32,190
to make sure that there is consistency

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:35,100
and then go from there so again it was

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,440
getting with components obviously their

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,420
styling and more and creating basic

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,170
components was like getting difficult to

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,970
manage so when we started out we

00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,080
obviously had all these different common

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,130
components so we had a lot of

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,070
discussions with

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:52,200
what is common what is in right so what

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,850
we did was we adopted style components

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,010
for all the design level components and

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,810
what I mean by that is all the common

00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,240
components that are going to be used

00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:03,390
consistently throughout the app what we

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,860
did was we used style components but we

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,140
used style sheets for any sort of slick

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,330
screen design because style sheets are

00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,610
great and in terms of like adding some

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,320
padding on the screen or just like how

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,820
that specific screen is going to look

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,710
like we just used style sheet because we

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,930
found that it was much faster than

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,210
having the discussion okay should we

00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,990
move this into a comment folder and can

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:27,090
we wrap this view with this specific

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,250
like CSS or something right and that

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:34,350
really helped us a lot because it really

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:38,970
are developing much much faster from a

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:40,950
design perspective so static assets so

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,360
for a story like as a user I want to see

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,490
the company's logo in the login

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,220
background obviously you'll see like a

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:50,850
lot of these common stories in your

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,590
backlog I'm sure and the typical way is

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,260
just like essentially providing like

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,990
three asked like three assets so

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:02,010
essentially a company logo at 2x will be

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:04,290
most likely used on an iPhone 7 company

00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,860
logo 3 X will be used on an iPhone 7

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:10,080
plus or a Nexus 5 and if there's no

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,250
image matching the screen density then

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,080
the closest the best option will be

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,370
selected and the beauty of this is react

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,580
native does that for us

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,770
right but what we found very valuable in

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,220
terms of like performance itself was

00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:25,950
that I'm not going to move is that react

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,080
native vector icons and we use a tool

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,150
called ICO moon just because we just

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,860
downloaded these vectors and like you

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,680
also like imported them as spawns and

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,430
that really improved the performance of

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:43,650
our app by a lot and also it was very

00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:47,790
easy to manage as well the next thing is

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:51,570
just like design tokens who here is

00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:53,610
familiar with the word design tokens ok

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,100
so I'm going to try my best I'm sure a

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,980
designer would do a much better job but

00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,280
design tokens are essentially obey like

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,550
it's essentially a toque

00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,620
and a common like theme language between

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,180
developers and designers just so that

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,400
y'all can talk

00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,800
y'all can reference the same sort of

00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,450
elements in development and design so

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,490
essentially all these are different like

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,340
categories for design tokens so just as

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:21,010
colors write different colors fonts font

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,870
sizes type scale these are something

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,820
that you will declare in a theme file

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,010
and then essentially you're creating

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,680
tokens so in things like instead of

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:31,240
calling it like a hex value and just

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,280
referencing that specific color

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,380
everywhere you would call it dark red

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,480
light red and so on so when you're

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,730
looking at like your design you will see

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,140
light red so exactly that's what's point

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,390
that's what you're going to reference in

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,760
the code so in future if you want to

00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:49,240
change let's say you know the hex value

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,190
of dark red you all you have to do is go

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,330
to this theme part and change it that

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:57,780
really helped us a lot just because we

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,280
want designers to be creative right and

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,620
especially like with like playing with

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,170
colors v scale and so on so when we

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,550
updated in one place it was like updated

00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,940
throughout the app which is very cool

00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:12,670
and storybook this is like one of my

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,440
most like favorite tools ever so sorry

00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,330
Brooke is a tool that essentially

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,910
enables developers to create components

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,650
independently and showcase those

00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,010
components and you can interact with it

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:26,200
right in an isolated dev environment it

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,940
this helped us so much because it helped

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,960
remove any barriers of communication

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,820
between design and development one thing

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,670
I should say though is story book with

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,620
react native is a little bit tricky just

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,780
because it's going to render like native

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,940
components on screen so if you think

00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,620
about it like when you use story book on

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,460
the web it's great because you just go

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,590
to your web

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,330
noria browser and open story book and

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,000
it's going to be accessible to everyone

00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:55,000
right with react native that's not the

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,370
case just because it's the story book

00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,610
react native library it's going to

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,440
render native component itself and you

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,930
cannot access native components in your

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,780
browser right so what we did was we

00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:10,270
added essentially a build variant and we

00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:13,480
essentially gave the story book version

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:15,549
of the app to like to everyone so

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,669
like when you're sending like bills and

00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:22,110
stuff like that you're going to get

00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:24,490
storybook as a different app itself and

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,679
the other cool thing in terms of like

00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:28,900
obviously this is great when you ship

00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,630
like shredding the same app to everyone

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,370
but if you want to like use use it in

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,380
your development environment I don't

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,750
want to open like a new app and like

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,630
every every time right so what we

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:44,470
essentially did was who here is familiar

00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:47,950
with this menu I'm sure everyone so

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,840
react native dev menu right so what we

00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,580
did was we used that library for call

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,490
react native dem menu which essentially

00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,169
adds a damn menu you don't have to use

00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,240
the library if you can also like call it

00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:59,740
yourself it's not that hard but

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,770
essentially what we did was added a

00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:06,790
storybook option in here so it became a

00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:09,400
lot easier so all we did was like shake

00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,020
the phone and like opened up storybook

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,520
whenever we wanted to modify any

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,419
components just so that we can see it

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:18,850
quickly so the biggest hurdle was

00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:21,190
communication between design and dev and

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:24,250
as I said storybook and design tokens

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:27,160
really helped you know helped bridge any

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,370
like communication gaps essentially and

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,049
that was really great just because in

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,850
meetings we would talk about or

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:37,630
designers that themselves would be like

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:39,370
we don't have this component yet and the

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,080
business is gonna be like we don't have

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,360
time for that and we're like okay let's

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,799
just do a variation of this and that's

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,540
how we were all like they were all

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,020
managing the components index ket and

00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,760
storybook which is like very cool so

00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,280
lastly from a release submission

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:59,320
perspective one of the important things

00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:01,330
is the branching strategy so there is

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,330
this diagram I just thought I should

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,309
just Google a diagram which is like

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:09,040
matches very close to what we try to do

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:10,690
and they space it in here it's not it

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,419
looks complicated but it's not I'm gonna

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,250
try my best to explain so essentially we

00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:17,410
only have like two branches one is

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,020
master which is the source of truth and

00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:22,720
the second is develop and develop is

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,120
essentially going to be your development

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,210
branch when you push your changes and so

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,600
on and then we create feature

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:34,080
and merger and develop now any sort of

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,630
like hotfix or like or any sort of like

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,850
releases would have its own branch so

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:40,500
for example when we sub want to submit

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,300
an app to the App Store we obviously

00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,800
want to do frequent updates right we

00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,630
don't want to just do like this one huge

00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,820
update and what we did was we just

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,070
created this like pre apps or submission

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,720
release branch and whenever we got any

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:54,090
feedback from the app server we just

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,260
applied it and merged it back in that

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:58,020
specific hotfix

00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,050
to the master and it really helped just

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,080
to keep things simple it really helped

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:07,620
us a lot

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:11,310
so continuous everything so CIC D

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:14,460
obviously we want those bills on our

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:16,470
machine right we when you're thinking of

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,270
mobile you're thinking of all these

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,100
different screen sizes but thinking of

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,480
portrait and landscape mode you're

00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:25,560
thinking of all these different things

00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,690
so we use a couple of tools and it might

00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,270
definitely look like I'm promoting

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:35,690
Microsoft but I'm the heart although I

00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:38,520
love the tools that that I have used so

00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:42,030
what we wanted was Abdus tribution two

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,190
devices gets a lot easier and anyone can

00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:46,680
get a bird and install it on a new

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:50,370
device obviously registered devices that

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:52,320
Apple likes to block distribution to all

00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,270
the devices but if you set up those

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,400
registered devices properly with the

00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:59,070
correct provisioning profiles is great

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,320
and the other thing is pushing live

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,480
updates we wanted them to be faster as

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,310
well with these couple of Microsoft

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,260
tools that I'm talking about it really

00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:10,890
helped us a lot in terms of distribution

00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:14,670
of devices managing like bills and also

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:17,970
pushing live updates so App Center who

00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:21,540
here is a fan of App Center awesome I'm

00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:23,070
very happy so App Center really helped

00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,830
us just because we was Amy were able to

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:28,170
like build test deploy and repeat just

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,930
like they said it totally looks like I'm

00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:33,000
watching Microsoft but I'm not but yeah

00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,520
it's just like App Center was really

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,130
helpful it's very easy to set up the UI

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,630
is great we were able to set up devices

00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,850
and

00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,620
provisioning profiles really easily

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,780
there were some things we had to go to

00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,270
like specific like Apple and Google Play

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,480
Store for but other than that it was

00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:54,440
like great and the most important thing

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,150
was the bug and regressions right and

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,640
you definitely want to avoid the

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,860
situation in the first place pick up but

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,650
these things do happen they say you have

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:06,140
this like your fancy app and you want to

00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:08,330
release it to the App Store and Play

00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:10,100
Store obviously after you release you

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,110
realize there's this major bug because

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,140
that's how it works right they don't

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:17,990
realize that there's a bug before that

00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:23,390
and you want to definitely avoid this

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:29,050
situation as much as possible so should

00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:32,840
I wait here for five seconds to enjoy so

00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:35,750
good Bush who here has used quote Bush

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:39,080
before this is great so you all can

00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,760
really empathize with the situation the

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,690
benefit of code Bush is that you can

00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,940
ship hot fixes without going through

00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,890
Apple so with Google Play Store its font

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,310
like it's they're not that strict but

00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:54,680
it's specifically Apple they are that's

00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:57,590
so the idea of like code push what you

00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:00,110
do is you can like essentially update

00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,580
your JavaScript bundle in production and

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:06,020
you don't have to go through the Apple

00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:07,460
submissions process again so one of the

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,590
challenges with the release of mission

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,630
from a release submission perspective

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,150
was that there are way too many tools

00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,340
out there that try to solve CI CD we

00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,530
just use App Center and we loved it they

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:22,730
consistently doing that someone at my

00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:26,000
company Aldrin actually wrote a great

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:28,250
blog post on react native CI CD pipe on

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,660
setting up the pipeline and it's awesome

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:35,360
you should definitely check it out

00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:38,960
lastly app store submission checklist as

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,970
I said earlier read the human interface

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,260
guidelines carefully because they are

00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,990
the ones they're really going to save

00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,870
your rejections Apple from rejecting

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:51,170
your apps write the comment at the other

00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:52,490
common app store submission failures

00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,050
were just like

00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,540
things must be clickable the proper

00:28:54,050 --> 00:29:00,559
touchable area and this is like such a

00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:02,230
common mistake that we are thinking of

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,090
like development obviously like add

00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,160
enough area around the length so that I

00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,540
actually clickable on devices obviously

00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,000
they will be clickable when you are

00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,770
developing it but when they go on phones

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,890
it's just depending on the screen size

00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,660
it's just gonna get complicated if

00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,510
you're using a third-party provider such

00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,100
as like Google or their Facebook author

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:26,210
or something like that please provide

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:30,290
more info in your apps or submission

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:31,820
process and and in there's a section

00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,440
when you're submitting an app to the App

00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,570
Store on like any sort of like

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,790
additional info that you can provide

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,400
please please please provide lots of

00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:43,130
details just because the poor people who

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,559
are testing it like they're just humans

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,390
just like us they want more context and

00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:51,200
once they do get that context they are

00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:53,960
going to give that info and lastly like

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,270
setting up a test account if you have a

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,280
log in set up a test account so that it

00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,990
becomes a lot easier for them to like

00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,429
log in and test out the app and these

00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:05,440
are some of the common like apps or

00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:08,000
submission failures that we have noticed

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,630
two more slides and we'll be good for

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,480
lunch animations with Laurie so as you

00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,860
can see like this is Airbnb and Laurie

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,650
is a library for like different

00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,929
platforms and it forces the Adobe After

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,480
Effects animations and we can export it

00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:25,580
as a JSON file right and you can render

00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,830
them natively on web and mobile to get a

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,620
consistent experience just to make our

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:33,020
apps look a little fancy we use Lodi

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,730
which is really cool I'll honestly use

00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,230
that like a few months ago I didn't know

00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:40,130
that many people there which is very

00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:42,020
cool and push notifications please

00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:44,420
please please use a provider for push

00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,730
notifications there was a time when I

00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,550
was doing native development and we

00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:52,730
literally spent a month just doing push

00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:57,710
notification a good provider is one

00:30:52,730 --> 00:31:00,110
signal as one trusts one signal there's

00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:03,050
a time for there and just because I was

00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,610
doing a lot of gdpr recently I using one

00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:07,130
trust as a provider that's why I just

00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:09,020
added in it's actually one signal

00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,809
but yeah like definitely use a provider

00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,640
it will make your life a lot easier for

00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:15,530
push notifications or the device

00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,260
management and everything is just easily

00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:20,390
done so yeah this is pretty much the end

00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:23,929
if you have any questions comments

00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:26,270
feedback make it positive catch me after

00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:29,870
I'll be around for lunch and during the

00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,620
day as well and thank you so much for

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,970
listening

00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:47,279
[Applause]
