Title: Chain React 2019 - Lorenzo Sciandra - All Hands on Deck - The React Native Community Experience
Publication date: 2019-08-06
Playlist: Chain React 2019
Description: 
	"A useful metaphor for the React Native project is that of a huge ship. Operating such a vessel is a massive effort, that requires many people running back and forth the deck hoisting the sails and lowering the anchor - but also rowers, cooks, and skippers just to mention a few. During my two years on this journey, as a developer not working for FB, I've experienced and participated in the evolution of the project from a unique vantage point.

I could tell tales for days of the many seas we've been through, the high waves and the storms we've weathered - but one constant has been the help provided from other sailors like me, part of the community. The collaboration with the RN team allowed for increasingly more complex roles and projects to ship - and we are all but done.

So I want to raise a glass to these companions, and through my narration showcase what the community accomplished - and the new horizons we are steering towards.

so I mean he already I could never do

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,840
something else cool as day but hey I'm

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,689
calset you probably know me by that name

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,660
and yeah I'm a software engineer for

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,640
formidable apps I'm a maintainer for the

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,580
main magnetic repository you may have

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,630
seen me there I've been one since

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,750
basically January 2018 and since January

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,809
2019 more or less I've became also one

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,730
of the owners which is like not really a

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,950
great term I think well like that's what

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,219
get up says of the react native

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,989
community and today I really want to try

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,730
and share with you what my experience

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:56,190
has been for but you're not basically

00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:58,739
you see when I actually think about

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,930
react native and I think about like how

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,199
my relationship with the community

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,110
started I sort of go into you know

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,170
imagination mode like I just forget what

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,260
I wanted to say and I start thinking and

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,380
dreaming and I sort of think that my

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,049
relationship as being basically the same

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,750
one that the kid would have when living

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,580
in a sea city like when you live and you

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,070
go to the docks and you see all these

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,189
massive vessels and you're like oh

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,479
that's great I would never go on those

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:35,700
things but you know one can dream and so

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:42,450
what I would do it's just draw and

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:44,460
imaginal well you know like in reality

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:50,009
of course I'm not a kid anymore so what

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:52,450
I did when I started being into the loop

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,810
is it working okay

00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:58,180
is basically I started rising like I

00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,619
couldn't help myself thinking that they

00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:05,799
were so massive anything was so big and

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,420
I didn't really fell it could be like up

00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,170
to the challenge I really felt that the

00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,000
only way I could provide any kind of

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,150
usefulness back to this great community

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,030
was to write and you know it was like a

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,370
few years ago so it was first a medium

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,709
which now can be a bit controversial

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,620
because you know medium on the paywall

00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:29,440
and everything well you know it was the

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,750
only way I could really see myself you

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,030
know trying to give back so I started

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,540
writing an article and then I just kept

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:41,140
going and it was great like I never have

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,670
expected this to work like like one of

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,829
these articles the visual studio code

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,470
one which was the first one I wrote what

00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:51,760
about code like why anyone would care

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:54,160
but clearly I was trying to help people

00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:00,100
similar to me and that resonated with

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:03,220
some people then over time I started

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,290
becoming an open-source citizen

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,989
basically so it's sort of understanding

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:12,730
how for example you know if should write

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,359
something you should probably try to out

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,690
with it

00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:18,069
with the website instead of like of

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,959
writing like your own blog post because

00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,630
it's more likely the people would see it

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,150
if it's it's in the documentation but

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:28,359
still I didn't feel like I was good

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,120
enough like I felt really that I wanted

00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:33,190
to try and become a sailor I wanted to

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,060
try and board on a shape but reckon it

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:39,220
was still too big so back then rack

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,040
navigation was in a bit of a weird spot

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,010
like if you have been a developer for

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,190
like a year now now like now it was

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,739
almost three years ago probably you

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,989
remember there was this dark phase in

00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,150
which the original maintainer sort of

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:57,340
disappeared and there was a couple of

00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,349
people Spencer Matt that were trying to

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,180
keep the boat afloat and since they were

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,489
you know literally asking for help I was

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,209
like you know what I don't feel I'm

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:11,370
still good enough to you know

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:13,709
with the code but I see that you and I

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,540
want to try and do you know something

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,000
else so I started in doing issue

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,400
triaging and sorry started closing

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,120
issues well not just closing them of

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,919
course I would reply and help pen but

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,080
then you know eventually you close an

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,270
issue and then I kept closing and I kept

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,639
closing and I thought you know what I'm

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,910
I found the right approach I'm doing

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,280
great

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:42,870
and then basically after four months I

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:46,110
totaled out like looking now back it's

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,970
like I was doing crazy like I was

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,430
checking the numbers and I commented on

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,000
over nine hundred issues in like four

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,930
months

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,910
that's like didn't have any idea what I

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,139
was doing and I literally burned myself

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:03,479
to the ground but that sort of kind of

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,860
helped me like after a couple months of

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,789
being like you know what I'm done with

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,449
open source

00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:13,500
I got reached out by actor which is one

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:15,150
of the you know the main my engineers

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,039
from Facebook that works on the open

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,280
source aspect of you know Iraq native

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,590
and he asked me you know what do you

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,880
wanna help out and I was like well I

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:29,389
mean I only also but why not and so I

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:34,070
you know bordered on the big vessel and

00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:37,020
I started closing issues again I mean

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:39,360
where I literally felt that I wasn't in

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,650
a way of like the good developers like I

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,570
really felt that I could bring my

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,880
experience from rack navigation like I

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,770
would like in the past year and I'll

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:57,690
simply start being the maintainer only

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:59,759
commented on five on and it really was a

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,009
way for me to be around all these

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,630
awesome developers without actually

00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,509
feeling I was like blocking them in any

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,270
way and this experience was really

00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:11,789
particular because at some point I you

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,860
know went up to the main deck and looked

00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,719
around and they noticed something really

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,139
weird or like something I wasn't

00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:19,719
expecting that basically there were two

00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,589
votes

00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:25,569
I was like what and basically the reason

00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:28,329
for that is that as you may be aware

00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:31,179
like the react native repository an open

00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:33,459
source is a mirror of the code they have

00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:35,110
internally at Facebook and because of

00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,089
that there were actually two bolts and

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,339
there was a lot of manual work to keep

00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:41,589
them in sync there was a lot of work to

00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:46,329
keep them together and sail across the

00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:48,039
ocean and while this doesn't mean like

00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:50,949
regn it was still an open source project

00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:53,139
by all means this introduced a couple of

00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:55,589
complexities like for example the

00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:59,979
pipeline sometimes when you open a PR

00:06:55,589 --> 00:07:01,989
was a bit complex and you know sometimes

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:04,209
things just happen like new commits

00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:08,079
appeared or you know you get a new

00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:10,119
engine released either way through the

00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:15,489
morning you're like okay this happened

00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:17,409
like you know it's still like a really

00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:19,839
awesome open source project but these

00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:22,659
kind of peculiarities made it so that we

00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,300
really felt on our ship on the open

00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:28,659
source ship that on the community ship

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,489
story that we needed a better way we

00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:33,309
those ropes weren't enough we needed

00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:36,069
something more stable something of a

00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:37,539
fact in fact and so we introduced the

00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:40,029
discussion I preferred the repository

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:42,099
which basically was the first step

00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:45,789
towards making those two boats closer

00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:47,829
and closer and one of the main things

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:51,279
that these repositories you know

00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:54,069
triggered was that we realized that who

00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:58,029
helped these two boats to sail better to

00:07:54,069 --> 00:08:01,929
become you know less complex we needed

00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:04,839
to you know sort of take pieces of them

00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:06,759
and create new shapes of them like we

00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,529
should make the boat smaller and make

00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,050
new ships out of them and we can all

00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,909
sail together and basically this has

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,669
become what is called now like the link

00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:17,529
or effort where basically a few

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:18,279
components from the main react native

00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:21,749
koruba

00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,619
have been moved to dedicated open source

00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:25,989
repositories in the rack native

00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:28,119
community organization and so all of a

00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:30,159
sudden it wasn't just our boat it wasn't

00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:33,610
just the massive shape it was like all

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,790
these you know ships sailing together it

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,840
was

00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:39,790
fleet basically and it was great and I

00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,710
mean he's still great we're seeing so

00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:44,620
many more people getting involved but

00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,870
this also kind of challenged me because

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,810
I really felt that I had to take a step

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,370
back and change a bit my role okay I've

00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,430
been a sailor now for let's say a year

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:57,040
or something I really felt that wildest

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,710
effort was leading towards a more

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,230
sustainable future overall for the code

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,420
base because it would introduce you know

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,460
less complexities in making these

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,830
components extracted like the webview

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,790
like it was easier to get new releases

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:15,220
it was easier to merge PRS I felt that

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:19,290
it was time for me to take a step back

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:23,740
and ask how and why we were doing this

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,690
at first so it's you know almost 5:00

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,350
p.m. in the afternoon you've been

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,200
sitting all day

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:33,250
we already did you know some bit of

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,590
gymnastic earlier but I want to play a

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,720
game I hope you're excited I am because

00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,080
it's a stupid game so I really hope

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,340
you're aiming with me okay the game is

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,920
really really simple I'm gonna show you

00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,440
some things and they're gonna have an

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,800
emoji if it's the thumbs up you're gonna

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,320
say well if it's the boo if it's the

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,240
thumb down it you say boo and if there's

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,300
the third emoji you decide you can say

00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:03,000
good or Moo okay let's try this okay

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:07,930
ready ready okay we found the treasure

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:19,410
yes that's how I want it but the Pirates

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:19,410
want us dead it's perfect Jack Sparrow

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:28,030
yeah I'm not gonna judge you for this

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,860
reaction but yes so let's keep the game

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,100
going but let me show you the map of

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,320
being drawing you see over time I've

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,510
been trying to get more data more a

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,190
better understanding on how things are

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,550
going over all the react native and

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,020
interact native community and I want to

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,780
share with you some day so that you may

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,570
know you may not know but the core idea

00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,570
beyond is

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:54,140
is that what I found out is that react

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:56,900
native is not sunsetting is not dying

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,000
is here to say and I wasn't you know

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,370
give you some numbers let's keep the

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,280
game here's the first piece of that

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:08,510
about react native he has over 70,000

00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:11,120
stars on Gita yeah I mean you know

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,560
sourcing either path but it's like it's

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,130
a little bit remember then let's say I'm

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,070
p.m. downloads because those are flaky

00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:21,170
there are 77 thousand and relapse like

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:27,080
currently in the store like this number

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:28,730
is massive like like it's crazy yeah oh

00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,050
yeah sorry forgot so we were playing the

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,580
game right and what's one and as well

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,500
this is also good one

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,380
there are almost a quarter million

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:43,940
repositories any react native like using

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:46,700
native right now yeah I mean that's

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:51,590
crazy that's massive it's such a massive

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:54,080
number and it really feels great for me

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,480
to be here with you because I these are

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,580
just a few numbers like if you were out

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,190
being you know involved or like on

00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,080
Twitter mostly you may have noticed like

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,570
companies like Microsoft like they have

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,220
something about 30 apps currently in

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:11,150
production using react native which is

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,070
crazy valve the the gaming company like

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,460
the new steam chat app it's in react

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,850
native

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:21,110
like it's clear that we're not alone

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,510
it's not like we're just you know the

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:27,170
cool dudes using it and then anyone else

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:30,650
outside is not using it like other

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:32,990
reason are things there B&B article like

00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,300
I felt there was a general distrust

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,850
about directly and I wanted to refer you

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,940
like you're not alone Arachne deserves

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,960
to stay but what about the Iraq Native

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,980
community okay

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,840
this is where I want you because some

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,690
that are really surprising for example

00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,400
there are almost 77 thousand stars in

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,790
direct native community it's almost as

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,870
big as the main react native repository

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:03,450
it's madness right

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:06,690
yeah there are 70 like 71 repositories

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,130
of which 25 are from the lean core

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,190
effort can you imagine

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,870
yeah it's like so much more

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:17,030
responsibility and so much more

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:20,130
swiftness and we can do things faster

00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:24,570
but there are 45 of these repositories

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:28,200
that have only one maintainer alright I

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:32,430
mean of course now I sort of forced you

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:36,300
into saying that like me out why should

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:40,020
you care like why right who cares like

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,360
someone maintainer enough well maybe for

00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,460
like if you have a side project if

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,920
you're you know on your own you publish

00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,540
your own library on your you know

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,050
personal github account maybe that's

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,960
enough

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,650
but you see being a maintainer in

00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,600
open-source

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,140
it literally means having to do all

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,090
those things like usually when you're a

00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,980
maintainer you do that on top of like a

00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,780
full-time job or you've stumbled into

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,190
the role like it's not something you're

00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:09,330
like you know what I'm gonna do this

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:12,090
full-time usually something you take

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,490
this responsibility upon you and you

00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,380
want to do it good like you want to be

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,050
good at what you're doing you want to be

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,590
helpful but as you can see like of

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:24,510
course like in recognition in particular

00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:27,300
like even keeping up with their releases

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:31,290
and as the guy who does the releases I

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:34,230
know like when we did 60 like even if we

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:37,110
stayed like we communicated for like

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,520
three weeks to the library maintainer

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,340
hey you know what you should be ready

00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,020
for Android X some libraries weren't

00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,060
ready yet and it's because sometimes

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,000
it's really take a lot of effort to be

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,830
always on top of react native and of

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,280
course you have to do like review

00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:56,460
external PRS do issue triaging like a

00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,230
lot of these things are really important

00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,010
but at the same time they're a lot of

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,300
work and of course you could also be

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,150
saying well I'm not maintainer why

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,280
should I care well let me tell you in

00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,730
the reg Native community there are 70

00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,489
repositories and their whole ear and

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,319
I just alighted a few but it's most

00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:20,850
likely like you have at least one of

00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:22,829
yours in one of these in your code base

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,439
and I mean literally at least one

00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:29,850
because JSC is literally one running

00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:33,350
since 58 so you should care because

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:37,319
these libraries are affecting your code

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,129
and you can say okay okay there's a lot

00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,019
of work to do

00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:42,449
alright this code is the one I'm using

00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,759
alright yeah it's right so you know

00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:48,389
everyone knows that read native is the

00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,910
way it is but maybe you have never been

00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:53,189
into a scenario like in the Iraq native

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,129
fat blob scenario where like all of a

00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:59,249
sudden the maintainer just disappeared

00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:05,989
literally like from one day in October

00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:05,989
to November 2017 just disappeared well

00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:11,149
that's really scary like all of a sudden

00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:15,329
you're relying a lot from this library

00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:17,789
it just disappears I mean you could say

00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:20,579
well that was a long time ago well not

00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:22,739
really like they are they're finally

00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,929
moving to a fourth version and I think

00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:27,059
you in March they finally removed this

00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:29,669
line from the readme but imagine staying

00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,139
on a library for a year enough but it's

00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:33,569
not being intended just because the

00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:38,129
material disappeared it's not like out

00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:40,169
of you know you know it wanted to do to

00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:44,369
harm someone it simply disappeared for

00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:46,829
whatever reason and you know it's not

00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:48,600
cool when it happens you can say you

00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:50,939
know it's something that only happened

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,189
once and it's not for everyone but like

00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:55,049
let's take another example and I wanted

00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:57,470
to keep it real because like I've been

00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:59,699
bitten by these libraries before and

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,499
recognized a push notification as like

00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:06,230
the best name ever and we all know that

00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:09,870
push notifications are hard but I mean

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,579
it's basically unmaintained to like they

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,490
never reply to issues and you could be

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:17,970
like well why are you so harsh like that

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:20,789
issue is open since May like give them

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,709
cut stones like well yeah I would if it

00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,500
wasn't that I really opened the same

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,140
issue

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,020
in October 2017 and it's still not

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,179
replied so you know these kind of things

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,270
can happen like when you rely on a

00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:37,059
third-party library that it's only

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,220
managed by one maintainer because of all

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:40,659
the things that needs to be done you

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,289
cannot exclude that this kind of

00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:46,539
scenario could happen and I mean it's

00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:48,720
not like it's something particular to

00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:53,530
rec native is something particular to

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,960
you know JavaScript it's a really big

00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,120
problem in the old open source world

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,510
like there's this awesome book written

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,240
by Nadia Iqbal called Rodham bridges

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:06,340
which is basically it's one other forty

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,340
pages but it's free is a PDF you can

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,590
download it for free it's the website of

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,990
the Ford Foundation but the core idea

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,510
behind this book which is like something

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:19,299
you could have your city or it or CEO

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,789
even so it's not super technical but the

00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,860
core idea is that open source just like

00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:25,870
infrastructures like road and bridges

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,830
need maintenance need regular

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:33,390
maintenance and I mean there are so many

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:35,440
examples in that book about like why

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,960
something may happen to an open source

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,460
project like I've listed three here but

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,520
I'll only mention the first one which is

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,830
the open SSL you may know is a protocol

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,970
that it's used to secure communication

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:50,620
over the web this library was an open

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,400
source project that before

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:58,270
in 2014 the art bleed bug was found by

00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,240
as a research researcher from a security

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,370
team at Google it was maintained by a

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,470
guy in his spare time like can you

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:08,080
imagine like a project that runs 2/3 of

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,179
the web it was maintained by one guy in

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,210
his spare time and it was simply because

00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:15,460
no one knew and now oh like luckily

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,100
there are like four people working on it

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,720
full-time but that's just one examples

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,049
like the open source world is full of

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,580
these issues in particular what could

00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:27,100
happen in the rack native community I

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,710
mean here like you don't need to really

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,049
see what is written there but like the

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,460
yellow that you see there is all the

00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:37,540
repositories that have only one intere

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:40,940
and why this can happen in a community

00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,110
well I think that this boils down to two

00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,030
big issues

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,340
the first one is the governance issue

00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:50,270
and the second one is the sustainability

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:54,650
issue let me guide you to through the

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:56,510
first one so governance first off let me

00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,690
take a step back why do we even need an

00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,850
organization in the first place well two

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,730
main reasons to be honest one is shared

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,470
ownership basically if you're a member

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:09,320
like literally in the github

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,450
organization you remember you have write

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,640
access to all the repositories it means

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,650
that you're a trustworthy person and we

00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,600
trust that you're gonna be able to jump

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,300
on any of these repositories at any

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,310
given point and help if you know help is

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,770
needed or if you feel like it like oh

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,260
you know what I see that this reading as

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:29,060
a typo you can just go there do a commit

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,160
and you can push it because you'll

00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:34,070
remember you're someone we can trust

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,140
and also it really removes a part of the

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,930
issue of like someone just disappearing

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:42,080
if someone disappears well it wasn't the

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:44,360
person it wasn't the gatekeeper so we

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,080
can just you know try to find someone

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,480
you help out and the other aspect is the

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,510
common tools like for example I don't

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,730
know many of you use like github

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,440
organizations but the dot github is

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,460
basically a specific kind of repository

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,130
that allows to propagate a certain kind

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,130
of files which are called the community

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,680
health files so like the code of conduct

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,020
so like the issue templates across all

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,390
the repositories and by doing so we can

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,830
remove a portion of the responsibilities

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,230
of the single maintainer because we

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,950
already provide those things pre-baked

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:24,200
and also like we have tools like rag

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,830
Native Bob which is an awesome CLI tool

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,360
that helps with creating third-party

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,950
libraries interact native which is

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,530
maintained by Satya which is one of the

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:36,170
best person people one of those people

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:39,050
in the rack Native community or like

00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:41,990
even the circle CI orb is basically a

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,630
pre-baked set up for having a CI in your

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,820
tur part in your library and of course

00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,320
like we're even investigating actually

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,450
having a proper template so like when

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,810
you

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:54,000
create a new repository in the org

00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:56,550
you're gonna have a radio all the files

00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,360
ready to use because we've created a

00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,410
template and as you can see there's a

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,600
lot of extra value in having

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,930
organization but how is the governance

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,650
working right now well it's not really

00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:12,810
like I mean it kind of is working but

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,240
usually the way it works is like this

00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:18,060
like I open an issue or someone open an

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,820
issue in the dot gita book repository

00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:25,400
and we just you know propose something

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:29,910
and then you get some emojis reaction

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:32,010
and then you just wait literally that's

00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:35,310
not good enough like we should have some

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,080
sort of level of you know governance of

00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,870
decision making so that we can proceed

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,460
and we we're not staling on some I mean

00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:44,160
even this scenario that's a really

00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,680
simple thing like how can we define when

00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,320
to migrate a repository and I mean now

00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,910
I've sort of decided that that was good

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,950
enough and we're gonna go for it but

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,650
that's not the way you should work right

00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:58,710
and I mean again it's not just a problem

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:00,840
for our for us it's a problem that has

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,660
been around forever there is this

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,880
awesome document called the tyranny of

00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,460
structure lessness sorry for my

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,250
pronunciation and basically what this

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,960
quote is trying to say is that when you

00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,690
have a group of people and you don't

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,750
have defined rules those who know what

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,670
the rules we'll just use them at their

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,220
advantage or like they will use it in

00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:25,500
ways they you know they can't just bend

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,980
them around and the other words are only

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,840
gonna be confused they're gonna stay in

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,560
confusion or suffering for paranoid

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,270
delusions

00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,030
and that's true like if you don't know

00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,530
what's going on it's not like well I

00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,870
could read this and understand what's

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:43,290
going on you're just there hoping that

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:46,080
something will happen and this is again

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:47,070
it's not really a cool thing so what

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,490
could we do

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,800
like we're proposing a few years from

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,810
now and I would love for you guys to

00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,670
help me find a good solution but

00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,530
basically the ideas that were tossing

00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,630
around now are like selecting a group

00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,220
that decides for everyone and

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,769
could be an interesting idea but you

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,809
need to select those people we could go

00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:08,880
for the RAF's consensus which basically

00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:11,279
is what we're doing right now which

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,380
means unless someone has a really good

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,669
reason for not wanting to do something

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:19,409
we can just go for it or and this is an

00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:23,100
idea from Harry which i think is in the

00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:24,929
room Brenna and Mady are based on the

00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,110
fact that we could have a voting system

00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:31,110
that would prioritize you know decision

00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:34,649
making based on you know maybe donations

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:36,450
and actually I mean none of these are

00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:39,929
like a one-stop solution is gonna work

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:43,169
perfectly but it surely is opening a lot

00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:44,580
of doors and talking about money let me

00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:48,049
switch to the second topic I wanted to

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:50,159
talk with you about sustainability well

00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:52,409
here's the thing about sustainability

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,769
when you don't have one in open source

00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:59,549
in particular at any given point a

00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:01,350
maintainer could rightly sob like I mean

00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:04,620
I've mentioned those extreme examples

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:09,090
before like when you use an open source

00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:11,279
software with a license I'm 99.99 99%

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:15,629
sure that that license that you never

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:20,220
read DJ says the software is provided as

00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:23,879
is which basically means I have no

00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:27,620
responsibility in making your bug you

00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:30,419
know working my version but you know

00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,279
this also means that like you cannot

00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,659
impose anything on these people because

00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:36,840
usually they're working for free like

00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,700
they there is no reason for them not to

00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,769
do it if they don't want to and have

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,299
been in many conversations like a lot of

00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:45,570
this conversation I'm having with

00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:47,519
Montagnards are always somehow around

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,559
this problem of like you know now I have

00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,990
you know I need to focus on my daily job

00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:54,570
or we're not using the repository

00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,519
anymore so I don't really have any drive

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,620
to keep you know maintaining it because

00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:03,240
simply I don't use it I don't care any

00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:05,159
more about it and the mosan like the

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,799
part that distresses me most about all

00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,389
of this is that usually when I do have

00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,549
these conversations it's not with

00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:13,580
maintainer that have stopped sweet

00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:15,650
maintainer there are just

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,680
on the verge but they don't want to

00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:21,770
subscribe working and this leads to of

00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,840
course overworking and again from

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,630
previous experience I can tell you that

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,030
this is gonna lead to mental issues even

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,070
burnouts and I mean this is something

00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:34,070
that touched me personally and I really

00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:35,870
want to stress it it's not good like

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,150
this is not good we shouldn't get to

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,910
that point so here's the big question

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:43,610
how can we ensure that the task of being

00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:45,350
a core contributor and a maintainer for

00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,690
a repository in the organization in the

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:51,110
RAC native community is not a stressful

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,480
and negative experience while keeping

00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,310
said repository in a healthy state given

00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,590
that you know a lot of us are depending

00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:00,350
on it like the broader community is that

00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:02,750
is this library is probably relevant for

00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:05,090
the community how can we fix it

00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:09,020
right I mean I love easy problems

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:12,410
apparently but hear me out discussing

00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,420
this kind of problem a lot in the last

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:17,900
six months so let me give you like a

00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:22,070
brief overview of like a few options

00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,870
that we've came to to agree on well one

00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,090
we could reduce the workload per

00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:28,700
maintainer and I mean this is logic like

00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,500
if there's too much work let's just you

00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,290
know introduce some more maintainer like

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,840
gets more CI more CD more bots into the

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:37,150
repository let's try to reduce the

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,550
amount of work that needs to be done

00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:41,900
yeah that's sort of good I mean you're

00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,850
still not solving the issue of like

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,360
someone having to do this on top of

00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:49,280
their day job so how about let's

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,500
introduce some money at the organization

00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:55,010
level how about an open collective well

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,960
yeah that could work but in the road and

00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:58,880
bridges like these hypotheses this

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,860
solution of like going for an

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,130
organization which gets money and then

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:07,430
gives those money to the maintainer as

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:10,780
creating in the past like in systems

00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:13,850
foundations like the jungle one like the

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:16,160
what happened was that they weren't able

00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:19,330
to give the money to the maintainer

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,940
because if they did then technically

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:25,040
that company would have been not a

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,570
nonprofit so like not a charity so they

00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,500
couldn't receive donations or anything

00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,650
like that

00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,409
so typically it's a really big mess and

00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,990
also like how do you define who gets

00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:39,350
which amount of money I mean it's still

00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:41,870
an idea but you know as some cons how

00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,120
about then let's just move it to the you

00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,799
know personal level money influx I mean

00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,130
that's good right we have get up

00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,470
sponsors we have patreon it could work

00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,990
like because well first off you don't

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,730
need to organize anymore like you get

00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,770
this amount of money but at the same

00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,570
time there's gonna be an organic

00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,659
imbalance because basically if you're

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:06,049
like let's say a developer talking at

00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:07,970
conferences and you know doing react

00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:10,370
native releases probably you would get

00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,799
more attention and more Drive towards

00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,360
you then someone who is simply one of

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,380
the maintainer of the community and

00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:20,240
that's not a good thing so here's the

00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,090
fourth option and this is actually the

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,330
one I think it's more interesting

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,909
overall let's introduce more sake

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:31,850
holders in the game let's have more

00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:34,850
companies adopting repeaters in the

00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:37,400
organization because well if they adopt

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:39,080
it well first off we can sort of ensure

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,929
that there is going to be quality and

00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,640
consistency because they you know

00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:45,860
wouldn't be that company that maintains

00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,830
that component that never works right

00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:51,260
and also you would pay your developers

00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,510
to work on it so we're removing the fact

00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,309
that one maintainer is to do it and if

00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,630
that one trainer wants to live well

00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:58,340
you're a company you probably have

00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,970
another developer that is gonna take

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,559
that spot like you have a level of you

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,559
know administration over the property

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,789
that when it comes to you know

00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:09,440
interpersonal relationship in a non

00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:16,159
working environment gets way more

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:18,380
complex and well this is the time so I

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,929
don't want to waste any more time of

00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,640
your so let me just finish this up by

00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:25,549
saying that if you want to get involved

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,750
if this talk has touched us pocket you

00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:29,000
and you're like oh yeah I should

00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,590
probably try to do something let me ask

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,760
you this question who are you because if

00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,610
you're a company I would really

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,230
recommend that you start by doing what

00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,549
good idea or caustic that are doing well

00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,059
like they are actually adopting

00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,749
components from the rack

00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:45,179
community and it's really a great thing

00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:47,039
or you can go for the other route which

00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,409
is like what we do it formidable what

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,080
futurist has been doing of like paying

00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:54,870
your developers for the open source work

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,629
they do on top of their day job which is

00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,940
a bit more complicated because you need

00:30:57,629 --> 00:31:01,769
to know your developers you need to you

00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,590
know have clear rules of engagement so

00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:06,629
like okay don't over work like you

00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,279
always need to pay attention to that but

00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:10,110
instead if you're an individual please

00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:13,049
just reach out to the maintainer of the

00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:14,369
rep where you use the most like I wanted

00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:16,590
to present sure that every single

00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:18,929
maintainer in the rag native community

00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,259
would love to see an issue up and saying

00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:23,820
hey do you want some help like I'll be

00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:25,799
able to introduce you they're gonna be

00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,619
able to alcohol to get in started it

00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:30,090
would be great and overall if you're

00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:33,299
interested in deuce in these two

00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:35,009
specific problems there's the key table

00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:38,730
organ is repositories that I already

00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:40,409
mentioned I at one is where we have two

00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,269
dedicated issues one for the governance

00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:43,649
one for the sustainability if you want

00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:45,629
to leave a comment there there's a

00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:47,730
better version of what I just said there

00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:51,690
so you can refer to it

00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:54,749
I swear I'm almost done but let me just

00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:56,940
give you a quick PSA of why you should

00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:59,129
not do this well first of you should not

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,289
do it for the money until we saw

00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:04,169
sustainability because like there's this

00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:06,919
fake idea of like oh wow if you're an

00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:12,480
open-source maintainer you know you have

00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:16,320
you're the cool kid and like everyone

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,720
wants you right no not really like if I

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,509
have to make a graph of the money I've

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,269
earned by doing open source and then

00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:27,110
have as an experience all the money I've

00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,110
spent in therapy

00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:33,100
so yeah just don't do it for money until

00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:35,710
we solve sustainability so please help

00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,879
us solve sustainability first and also

00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,850
don't do it for the glory

00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:41,980
like if you're in for like oh wow I

00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:45,129
could be the greatest and everyone will

00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:47,320
love me yeah basically the work is not

00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,940
as fun as you may think

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,919
so probably you'll just drop off in a

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:54,480
month like it's I'm not trying to

00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:57,940
sugarcoat what the responsibilities are

00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,369
not the other aspect of it is that is if

00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,259
actually instead you want to use it as a

00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:03,820
way to get started in open-source the

00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:05,679
RAC native community is a great place

00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,830
because there are lots of people lots of

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,580
things to do a lot of easy to reach

00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:14,799
issues and things that can be done and

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:18,489
to conclude and I swear this is last one

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:22,629
instead why should you do it right well

00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:24,999
okay so you don't get any money you can

00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:29,049
do like you don't get any actual glory

00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:31,600
right why we do it well actually and

00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:33,879
this is where I get really cheesy like I

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,980
can give at least seventy good reasons

00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:37,840
to do it like every single person I've

00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,609
met through the arachnid community and

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,139
every single person I've also met like

00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:42,970
in the main rapper like all the people

00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:44,950
from Facebook the guys from Sony

00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:47,289
infinite right like everyone I've met

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:50,499
it's been such a fulfilling experience

00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:53,350
like the fact that I've been able to

00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:55,690
even be here with you today is the mean

00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:57,970
I mean it's made possible by all of

00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,249
these that I've been doing and it's the

00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:03,340
greatest thing ever to me at least for

00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:05,350
now I at least you know at least like

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,609
you know therapy you know takes all my

00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:09,040
money but that's not gonna happen

00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:12,579
anytime soon if I'm good enough now oh

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,230
yeah it really feel makes a lot of sense

00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:15,909
to me to spare you that literally like

00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:19,299
you should just do it because of these

00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:20,980
awesome people and I'm sure this is

00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:26,200
something never heard before so I'm

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:28,179
gonna say slowly right the real treasure

00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,679
is the friends that we made along the

00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,750
way

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,820
thank you one

00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:48,119
[Applause]
