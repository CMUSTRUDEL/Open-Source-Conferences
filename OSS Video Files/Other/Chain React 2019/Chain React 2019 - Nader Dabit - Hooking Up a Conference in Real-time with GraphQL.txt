Title: Chain React 2019 - Nader Dabit - Hooking Up a Conference in Real-time with GraphQL
Publication date: 2019-08-06
Playlist: Chain React 2019
Description: 
	The problem: You're starting a conference. You announce the conference, start planning the venue, getting sponsors, & fielding talks. Things start getting serious, & before you know it you're overloaded with obligations. Oh, & you forgot: You also need a conference app!

You don't just want any conference app; you want it to be fun, engaging, & a valuable addition to the attendees. How can you do this in the least amount of time?

The solution: In this talk, I'll show how you can rapidly prototype, build, & deploy your app using GraphQL, React Native, & AWS AppSync so you can spend your time worrying about more important things in life. In addition to what you'd expect from a conference app, we'll be adding live chat so attendees discuss talks & speakers can field questions & interact with them in real-time.
