Title: Chain React 2019 - Vlad Novick- Demystifying complex animations creation process in React Native
Publication date: 2019-08-06
Playlist: Chain React 2019
Description: 
	While Animations can be created in React Native pretty easily, real world mobile apps require a combination of several layers of animations, gestures and micro interaction animations to make user experience stand out. In this talk we will walk through the process from defining complex animation, to implementing it by going through all stages of animation creation process.

thanks so much and yeah I'm like pretty

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,490
excited to be here I've been here last

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,519
year this year is even more amazing than

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:27,900
last year really excited to talk to you

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,090
about animations and I would try to sort

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,329
of like a story and sort of try to

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,719
demystify the creation process animation

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:41,129
creation process because sometimes is

00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:42,690
it's a thing we it takes out takes time

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,590
to understand like how to do it properly

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:51,239
so I'll try to weigh it out so just

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,840
briefly about myself after talked about

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,850
what i do i cam developer advocate Asura

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,609
I am Google developer expert I wrote a

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:05,129
book and read native I consult coins and

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:07,770
I do web mobile VR AR and IOT I like to

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,830
say I probably need a iron blockchain to

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,810
be on top of buzzwords so in in one

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,210
world I sort of like build cyberpunk

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,909
future in a good way and actually have

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:23,040
these seekers here so if you want to

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,990
grab them find me now I mentioned I work

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,000
for Hazara a Sirota generates

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,729
high-performance real-time Raphael on

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,189
top of existing database it can run

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,259
anywhere we're docking can run basically

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,240
you can connect it to any business logic

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,900
that you want and it has a venting

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,479
system now it's like it's really cool

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,799
performance and you can read more about

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,229
that if you and yeah it's for free

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,560
because it's open source so please also

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,229
contribute and you can actually go to

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,390
London asteroid attire and if you need

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,280
to graph you if you want to know best

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,200
practice in graph here it's not only

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,060
house or related related to any

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,729
technology out there we recently

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,090
published react native tutorials with

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:13,349
graph kill and how we do that so check

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:16,590
this out now to the topic of

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,269
I will talk why do we need to animate in

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,599
the first place right so I want to

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:24,000
address that and some people say okay I

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,430
will animate because I can I mean I

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,129
learned the API why wouldn't I do that

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,950
but it's important to understand why we

00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:34,349
do that and before that before talking

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,819
about animations I want to talk about us

00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:42,480
as humans we are visually driven

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:45,299
creatures this slide would have been

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,810
dull if it were without background or

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:51,599
without animation right so we are driven

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,370
toward something visually compelling

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:59,040
right so again why do we need to animate

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,379
we want our apps to stand out there are

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,419
millions of apps and any of the stores

00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:09,359
and we want when we develop our app we

00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:12,689
want it to be we want users to basically

00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:15,030
interact with our website how to pay us

00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:17,159
money for this app or do whatever you

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,849
want when whenever like you published up

00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,500
right we we want to provide our user

00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:25,829
users visual hints what you doing that

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,260
and I like to say we want to define a

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,269
story of Europe and yes we are

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,489
storytellers because we want you to

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,680
define how user will go from one screen

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,620
to another willing to interact with the

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,479
menus interact with icons with

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,030
everything you have an app you need to

00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,280
tell this story so user will be driven

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:48,120
towards visually compelling things to

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,519
interact with them now what we also want

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,620
to do we want to reduce cognitive load

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,150
and I will talk about that in a bit

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,599
and we also want to reduce cognitive

00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,829
friction and let's talk about cognitive

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,199
load and here I'm going from the tech

00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:06,750
topic to more psychology thing so

00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,359
cognitive load is basically the amount

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,120
of mental resources that takes us to

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,699
process some information right and I

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,930
will give you an example

00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:20,940
what is this see here just yell it out

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,010
right there is no me like it's just a

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,740
square right but if I will tell you I

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,980
have a line a specific link in the end

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,840
of this line I have another line

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,210
with the same length on the first line

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,850
for a perpendicular to the first line

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,620
and end of the second line there is a

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,450
third line perpendicular to the second

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,310
line parallel to the first line with the

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,900
same length of the first and the second

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,650
the end of the third line there is

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,210
another line perpendicular to the third

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,830
perpendicular to the first connected to

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,960
the first parallelity of a second of the

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,210
same length you will understand it's a

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,540
square but it will take you much more

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,060
time to process that the same apps

00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,160
without animations everything in this

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,430
world is animated there are physics

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,260
everywhere like everything is micro

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,890
interactions and tiny animations right

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,830
so if we show our users up without

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,280
animations they will it will just take

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,150
them

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,640
maybe milliseconds but it will take them

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:22,450
time to understand what this app is and

00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,600
what it actually means and this makes

00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:27,730
Europe stand out in a bad way because

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,290
then people like what's what's that up

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:33,340
I'll just uninstall it

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:35,770
and you can say okay fine but I will do

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,160
like flying animations exploding

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:42,910
particles fading fade outs all these

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,980
crazy stuff but then we can cause

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,370
cognitive friction and what is cognitive

00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:51,790
friction we are there is some kind of

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,670
visual language of things will expect to

00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:58,180
behave in some way let's say if I have a

00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:00,010
nap and I have a bullet in the middle of

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,310
the app that will explode the particles

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,200
that will spin assemble into a message

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,230
and there will be types text there and

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,810
it's a chat app it's not something that

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,630
you expect from the chat app so it was

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:18,940
like what's going on with my phone right

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:20,710
and that's because we need our UI to be

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,350
predictable we need to stick to the

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,780
practices that are already there I don't

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,890
I'm not saying don't invent anything I'm

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,900
saying learn from experiences of other

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,050
people learn from other apps that out

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,870
there that are working right and if you

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,719
want to invent your own visual language

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,839
you cannot obvious you can do so

00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:46,479
you need to be aware that you need to

00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,779
test that on users on actual users no

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,729
not your co-workers or your friends that

00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:56,379
maybe won't just tell you that your app

00:06:51,729 --> 00:07:00,789
sucks but on actual users of often of

00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:03,039
the app and UI should react fluidly to

00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:05,919
user actions which brings me to another

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,259
topic and let's talk about animation

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,269
types and I'm not talking about

00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:13,059
hand-drawn Disney Animation's I'm

00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:17,019
talking about animations in our apps and

00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:19,989
let's look at these ugly model

00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:22,029
animations so-called state driven

00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:24,069
animation what what what's happening

00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:26,199
with this model this model is appearing

00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:29,409
and disappearing what's wrong with that

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,529
the problem is I don't know what happens

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:36,039
right what is the user action if this is

00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:38,949
a form and the form is submitted then

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:41,110
what happened it got error it was send

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:45,579
it was just canceled

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:47,319
so I don't know right now I you

00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,119
basically leaving you users in the dark

00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,769
and I like to say you're basically

00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:55,389
shooting in every direction trying to

00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:58,749
get their attention but you know you

00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:00,759
need to do something else and let's see

00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:03,519
if this simple change right we can see

00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,219
that our form is opened and closed

00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,409
trying so we can understand that it goes

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,779
in the same place where it opened now if

00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:13,749
I submit this form it can it may fly to

00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:15,729
the right up corner or if there is an

00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:18,610
error it may just shake in the place

00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:21,759
right so it's different animations based

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,860
on user actions and this is called

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,409
action driven animations and this is an

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,929
example from Behance and I would say

00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:29,860
this example actually a good good one

00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:32,860
and bad one

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,199
a good one is showing what is action

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,659
driven animations but it's causing

00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:40,449
cognitive friction because it's too much

00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:43,269
I mean honestly I wouldn't expect like

00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:48,910
the call you want to just flip and do

00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:50,769
with this type of stuff right so another

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,529
type of animations is micro interactions

00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:57,259
and micro interactions is something you

00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:59,269
and maybe haven't noticed like if you

00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:01,459
open the whatsapp you probably will see

00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:05,180
lots of micro interactions you haven't

00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:09,259
seen previously let's for example look

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:14,209
at the inbox notifications right so what

00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:16,730
we can see here on the right top right

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:19,370
corner what we can see there we can see

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,680
spinning animations of the number we can

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:26,839
see color changes like opacity changes

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,610
text changes fade ins size changes so

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,230
all of these in one single animation

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,790
which may be a tiny icon on your screen

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,920
so what's the point right why do you

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:41,649
invest time and into this because these

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:44,689
these matters way more than this one

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:47,389
this one is too much but this one gives

00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:47,930
you a feeling of okay this app is kind

00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:50,149
of cool

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,160
and sometimes you even cannot tell why

00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:55,129
it's cool it is like it feels cool right

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,269
and this is because of micro

00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:00,889
interactions now there's the same magic

00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,449
is both in details and in the

00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,509
performance and I'm not talking about

00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:09,040
like software performance I'm talking

00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:13,100
about the how you do this magic and I

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,720
like to think basically I'd like to

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,809
welcome you to sort of a creative

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,620
College of wizardry and why I call it

00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:20,509
magic

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,329
because basically an insufficient

00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:26,509
technology it's indistinguishable from

00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:30,559
magic and let's do this like mental trip

00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:32,959
to medieval ages some one of you invent

00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:36,110
time machine go to medieval age I just

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,709
create react native up and show here I

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,809
have a new face book in medieval ages

00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:44,660
it's either you will be the best

00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:49,250
magician of the realm or more likely you

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:51,529
will be built at stake right so I would

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,809
like to think that all of us and all of

00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:57,079
you are magicians and storytellers and

00:10:53,809 --> 00:11:01,670
we are telling here a story of a young

00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:05,209
Marilyn which is a mage right his react

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,110
native mage and his experienced mage he

00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,990
already knows

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,170
animated API how many

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,880
you are using animators of API he

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,720
already knows Lottie how many of you are

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,399
using wotty

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:22,000
and he knows reanimated how many of you

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:27,040
are using reanimated cool so Merlin

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,110
knows all these three and he need to he

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,839
basically creates magic right so he gets

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,820
a design from a power proud artist and

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,180
he looks at the design I was like how

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,640
did he do that and he gets like it's

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,320
magic but I mean Merlin is a mage right

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,589
he's supposed to create this design so

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,339
how did he even starts right and he gets

00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:51,279
something like this so he has a bunch of

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:53,470
magical is that it's not that I'm not

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,870
loading but for that I have the actual

00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:01,120
up so let's scare it so as you can see

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,800
these leaves are here if you click on

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,940
the glyph that you get a list of spells

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,580
you click on a spell have another glyph

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,570
and you have sort of like parallax

00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:16,480
scrolling so he gets the whole thing and

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:22,209
he's like oh wait how do I start right

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:24,279
how do I start creating this and the

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,620
main concept in animation and creating

00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,600
animations direct native is sort of

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,260
divide and conquer you need to separate

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,779
what styles are changing and go like one

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,510
by one and understand what what's going

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:40,089
on so we have micro interactions here

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,520
right well ready so we've seen them tiny

00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:44,649
bouncing icons and we have action driven

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,459
animations because when I click on the

00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:50,800
our tap on the glyph I get to another

00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:53,200
screen with some kind of interactions

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,450
are different we have spring transitions

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,630
and we have so-called shared element

00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:04,000
shared element is on one screen there is

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:06,399
an element in one position on one visual

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,170
look and then on the other screen there

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,870
is another element when we move from one

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,430
screen to another it kind of moved to

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,970
that place it's called shared element

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:18,699
and we also have gestures animations on

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,500
scroll behaviors how many of you think

00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:23,790
there are gestures here and up

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,360
how many of you are thinking it's

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:30,930
onscroll behavior what about the others

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,990
so its installed the haters but yeah we

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:39,839
will sit in a bit so the different style

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:43,620
types are scale changes our opacity

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:48,060
changes translate of x and y we seen

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:51,720
this for parallax there are gestures

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:54,870
right which are basically using onscroll

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,290
behaviors to create these gestures and

00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:01,399
let's actually see in the code or sorry

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,779
we will see the magic scroll of merlin

00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:07,050
let's start with transitions of the

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,760
Scheldt element now for that will be

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,279
using react native fluid transitions

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,230
which is a library that using react

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,260
native gesture handler and it's library

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,089
that uses thread navigation which also

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,100
uses read native gesture handler and

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:22,920
basically it gives you the shared

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,470
element in a more convenient way you can

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:29,899
obviously do it yourself but it exposes

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:33,240
fluid navigator that gives you more

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:35,700
syntax sugar so transition will look

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,550
like this you have an wrapping element

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:42,089
transition with a shared key now this

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:44,459
shared key spells in this example will

00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:48,410
be the same key on two different screens

00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:51,839
and whenever we pass the same key

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:54,540
element will be transition from one

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,970
state on one screen to others to state

00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:01,440
on the other screen so in this example

00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:07,140
we are rotating it and let's see example

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:09,810
here so it's that rotation right now

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,680
what about parallax scrolling the

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:16,380
parallax scrolling and implementation is

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:19,440
pretty simple in a way we have animated

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:22,829
API when have animated event so what we

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,100
can do we can just take this animated

00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:28,170
event and set it on our animated volume

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,829
it's up to you can be on state it can be

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,910
on different different place and then we

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:35,800
need to translate from

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,830
one point to another but there is a

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,620
catch there we want to translate images

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,650
when they one behind the other right so

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,990
whenever we in the boundaries of the

00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,850
screen whenever we scroll image we don't

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,190
want to talk translate but we want to

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,170
translate the image that comes next on

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,200
the image that's before that that's why

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,470
I'm using index and we'll see I am using

00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,170
width of the screen to calculate the

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:06,070
amount of translate that I need to pass

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:09,700
to make two images translated one behind

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:12,550
the other now when I have these styles I

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:16,960
just add them as animated styles right

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:21,100
and it's supposed to work if I make this

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,900
get interpolate work now get our

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:27,610
interpolate function how many of you

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:30,460
using interpolate so interpolate

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,620
function basically what it does it gives

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:37,660
me okay this is my input range this is

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:40,570
my output range to your magic basically

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,370
you say there is the first element in

00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,860
the range the middle and the third in

00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:48,310
this case I have out of screen on the

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:51,220
right out of screen on the left and in

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:55,210
between when you are moving your your

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:58,540
image right and I'm saying if I have the

00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:00,580
first image then I just move it 150 like

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,490
half of the screen almost half of the

00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:06,520
screen and the other way around

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:09,670
if I snap to the left or to the right I

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,240
just go off screen now it's important

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:15,370
part to use extrapolate because if you

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,770
don't use extrapolation in general not

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,930
only in this example when you use

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:23,230
interpolate functions it's important to

00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:27,040
use extrapolate because especially with

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:29,140
the animated event because then you can

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,900
if you don't use that you can get

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,570
unpredictable results

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,810
what extrapolate does in this case it

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:40,630
clamps or like limits the range to the

00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:43,000
end of the output right at the end of

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:45,400
the input range because let's assume my

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,600
input range will reach two thousand

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,929
three thousand whatever

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:53,500
now if I have if I don't have clamp

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:56,200
defined then interpolate function will

00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:00,159
basically interpolate all the values in

00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:02,710
the same way that it did before hitting

00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,580
the end of the input range output range

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:10,240
so it's important to use extrapolation

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:12,100
now what about gestures using pain

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:20,220
responder how many of you use Bend

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:23,080
responder don't because you can get this

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,480
now I'm just kidding but you need to be

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,710
aware of the fact that we have just

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,070
native js-

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,720
I'm exaggerating here but i really

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,019
suggest you use react native gesture

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,659
handler for handling gestures on the

00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:40,090
native side obviously if you don't you

00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:45,220
cannot work around that you use in

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:47,919
responder and yeah now there is also

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,899
react reanimated and with react native

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:54,129
gesture handler gives you a little bit

00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:55,570
different API but it works completely on

00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:57,429
the native side don't need to pass

00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,799
native driver and reanimated has

00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:02,200
disclosed features and lots of really

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:08,169
cool stuff that you should probably

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:12,340
check out now what about really really I

00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:15,669
mean really complex animations something

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:17,529
like this which is not that complex so

00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:19,600
there is a lot elibrary and some of you

00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:22,389
are already using low T now with low T

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:27,429
what is a cool library that gives you an

00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:30,250
ability to get JSON from After Effects

00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:33,100
or something else for your designer used

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,529
and basically import this JSON as a file

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:39,789
inside drag native Lottie and have these

00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:42,519
cool animations on the screen so it's

00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:44,409
cool right but the problem is I've

00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,379
showed you example the micro

00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:48,879
interactions imagine you have an app and

00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:52,210
you tell yourself okay

00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:54,730
I want Gil or crazy online really heavy

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,970
action driven animations but I will do

00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,760
like 100 micro interactions and all of

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,850
them are using a Lottie

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,580
probably your app will crash especially

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:08,820
on Android but I'm not sure what Hermes

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,310
maybe it won't crash alrdy so ya need to

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:15,570
check it but the thing is with Lottie is

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:19,220
it's good but beware of some animations

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:22,860
with huge JSON files and with huge like

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:26,790
things going on and the problem also

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:29,280
when you rotate the screen with Lottie

00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:32,820
some animations behave differently

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,350
behave in really weird way so make sure

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,970
you have one too

00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:40,470
such animations and like I'm not the one

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,580
to tell you how many animations you have

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,310
in Europe right but think about

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,470
complications of having performance

00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:52,860
animations bad for performance now I

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:58,110
have several takeaways that I want you

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:59,760
to get from from this talk right and the

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,460
first one is animations are not that

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,960
scary like at all like what what you

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,330
need to do basically you need to

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,650
understand how to separate them to two

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,840
parts have to divide them conquer the

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:17,430
the magic spell that designer gave you

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,320
to create try and beware of state-driven

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,350
animations sometimes you get from

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,920
designer you get the whole animations

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,840
and you look at that and you say you

00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,230
know what it's staged real animations I

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,970
won't do that it's a good thing to say I

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,650
want you but I mean you work in the

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,050
company right so you kinda need to

00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,700
interact with your designer but like

00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:41,940
brainstorm together think about

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:45,060
something better something better for

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,550
users something better for for yourself

00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,890
also because action during animations

00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,170
will be easier to read later on it will

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,690
be easier to read the code if you write

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:58,080
them correctly now tell your story a

00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:00,450
story of your app because I mentioned

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,670
again you're all storytellers you're all

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:07,350
telling these cool stories in your apps

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:10,890
and it's important just to memorize this

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:13,530
concept that you you need to be aware

00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,770
what your users want and you you need to

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,990
be

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:20,670
we're how to drive your users towards

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,990
the desired goal right don't

00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,590
overcomplicate things

00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:27,840
lots of people overcomplicate things in

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,420
in a way of like let's abstract

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,400
everything oh let's do these cool

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:36,210
animations that will make our up stand

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,410
out oh let's do like I don't know sounds

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,540
something like don't over complicate

00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:43,980
things not only related to animations in

00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:47,310
general just don't reduce cognitive load

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:50,100
and reduce cognitive friction so every

00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:53,040
time you see animation think of how your

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,620
user will perceive this animation and

00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,070
how it if it will cause cognitive load

00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,110
or if it will cost : key friction right

00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:04,770
so the example of the chair tried with

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:07,290
exploding stuff and it might be cool for

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:10,620
a game it might be not cool for the

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:15,030
chatter and stick to work in practice

00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:17,670
practices and experiences and again you

00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:21,000
can invent things but when you invent

00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:23,190
things and invent new UX language new

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,500
your island your animations all of this

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:30,150
you need to understand that you need to

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:34,770
test them well on your actual users so

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:38,790
make sure you recognize that and think

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:41,310
what's better for for you now I have

00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:45,030
before like I want to wrap wrap it up I

00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:48,210
have an announcement I want to make so I

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,430
called back to school workshop so I will

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:54,180
be doing four workshops on react native

00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,890
online and to last two weeks of focus so

00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,170
it will be about animations with

00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,870
reanimated and with animated and with

00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:03,000
everything more getting into complex

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:06,060
stuff it will be a our workshop that I

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,420
did two days ago so it will be a

00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,950
different version but will be online

00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,280
there will be recently at workshop and

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,860
yes we will be actually creating actual

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:20,430
working up in reason ml and not just

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:22,980
hearing fencing talks and there will be

00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:26,280
react native with Bluetooth and IOT and

00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,210
yeah so I try to kind of bring all of

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,350
cool

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:34,440
talks I didn't recent years and do this

00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:38,820
like back-to-school thing this is just

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,100
like the the forum to get you if you

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,350
interested just like sign up and there

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:48,929
is QR code so it's easier for you to

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:51,870
scan and again I'm really happy to be

00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:54,390
