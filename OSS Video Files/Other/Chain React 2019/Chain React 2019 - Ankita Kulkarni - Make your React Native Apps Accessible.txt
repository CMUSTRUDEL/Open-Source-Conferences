so yeah let's get started so my topic

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,789
for today is make your react native apps

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,710
accessible I'm in Quito Buitoni

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,109
as you all know already and will

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,920
Solutions Architect at wrangle i/o so

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:29,010
yeah let's get started so I want to

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,810
start by asking a couple questions how

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,149
many of you have incorporated an

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:38,250
accessibility in your apps these raise

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:40,140
your hand cool and how many of you have

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,789
incorporated accessibility for mobile

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,920
apps Oh almost the same number

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,510
very interesting cool so I guess like

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,520
hopefully after this talk we can learn

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,980
more on how we can add accessibility to

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,340
mobile apps and also learn like some of

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,760
the techniques we could use from the web

00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,920
so what is accessibility accessibility

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,430
means making your apps accessible to

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,299
everyone

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,760
any person can have one or more forms of

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,430
disability it could be someone who wears

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,380
glasses or someone who has become a new

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,049
parent or someone who has partial

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,380
hearing loss now disabilities could be

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,170
permanent or a temporary and in terms of

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:29,610
accessibility we need to be inclusive

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:31,920
and think about everyone just gonna go

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,200
with the keyboard so what is

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,030
accessibility for mobile essentially it

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,280
means making your apps accessible for

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,409
all mobile screen sizes all devices

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,659
we've all we've all heard of

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,290
accessibility for the web for but for

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,380
mobile try turning on your voiceover or

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,180
when you are in a airplane use notice

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,950
that all these different apps they don't

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,880
perform very well when the internet

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,590
connection is turned off right or all of

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,360
these different things it means that we

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,790
need to make our apps accessible for

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,049
everyone so we are kind of like because

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,020
we want to be kind of fitting in like

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,770
more content on a smaller device and

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,379
that makes it really hard to understand

00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,709
and we need to make this native world a

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,680
more

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,450
inclusive place for everyone so as you

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,450
can see like disability is not the

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,180
problem right so I'm not gonna say like

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,549
just because I wear glasses I'm not

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,140
gonna say that I have a problem like I'm

00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,030
just gonna say have a problem seeing I'm

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,079
just gonna say like I wear or need

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,909
glasses similarly we need to think about

00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:40,709
the language that we use as well and be

00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:45,480
more cautious about it and yeah that's

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:47,159
everyone just like friends accessibility

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,169
also means that we need to design a

00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,480
seamless user experience for everyone

00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,310
it means designing your apps in such a

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,680
way that we don't think of like a

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,709
specific persona but we specifically

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,169
think about everyone and accessibility

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,790
is a priority and not an afterthought

00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:04,439
I'm really passionate about

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,969
accessibility in general so when I'm

00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,849
working with like different designers

00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,560
and developers right when you're

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,090
actually working on stories we start

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,159
talking about accessibility from the

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,930
get-go just because we want to make sure

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,150
that everyone understand what it takes

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,190
and if there are some compromises that

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,169
we do need to make in terms of making

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,819
the help the users understand the

00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:29,519
clients understand we kind of do that

00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:31,650
but the reality is that everyone has had

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,780
experience with accessible with

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:38,220
disabilities in general right whether

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:40,470
you yourself are a person with living

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,019
with one or have a loud one living with

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,329
one so like my mom for example will

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,459
always use the one scaling feature

00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,470
she'll go into the settings and always

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,199
increase the font size just because she

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,870
wears glasses and she needs that right

00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:58,169
so yeah this is like kind of the reality

00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,959
check that it can be you as well it's

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:04,169
not just someone who's maybe on a

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:09,720
wheelchair or not so these are all forms

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:11,609
of different accessibility and all I'm

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,470
gonna say over here is that a lot of

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:16,199
presentations talk about the business

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,560
buy-in on how like we need to care about

00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,759
the business and these number of users

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,950
we need to care about these number of

00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,240
users and so on but what I'm gonna say

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,310
here and I'm going to challenge that a

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,050
little bit I'm gonna say that we don't

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,699
necessarily

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,220
need to bring the business and the

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,780
picture right so for example let's say

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,690
if you start thinking of accessibility

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,759
as part of every stories every story

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,129
that you work on then you don't need to

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,650
like think about it as an afterthought

00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,720
it kind of gets really expensive when

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,030
you build this app and you don't think

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,430
of accessibility at all and towards the

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,900
end you add it as a feature right and

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,990
that becomes really really complicated

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,759
because like it accessibility just like

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,289
any other feature right it's like it's

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,789
not something additional it's just that

00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:03,620
there's a lack of awareness for it

00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:08,270
so who here knows the principle of

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,819
universal design cool so I'm gonna give

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,800
more context on that so it means that we

00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,580
need to provide the same means of use

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,050
for all users and one of the main

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,060
principles of universal design is that

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,789
we should avoid segregating or

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,219
stigmatizing any specific user and one

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:27,469
example of this is the curb cut effect

00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:30,050
has anyone heard about the curb cut

00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:34,400
effect at all or seen a curb cut I'm

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:37,340
sure we all have so essentially let's

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,969
say with the idea behind the curb cut

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:43,729
effect is that it's not necess

00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:47,240
right so let's say I am pushing a

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:49,610
shopping cart and I have something I'm

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,949
carrying something heavy or let's say

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,440
someone is on a skateboard or someone is

00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:56,419
pushing a baby stroller on the curb the

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,340
curb cut effect the idea behind this is

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,050
like all these tasks are easier just

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,090
because of the curb cut effect and it's

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,039
not designed specifically for someone

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,229
because it accommodates everyone and

00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:10,310
that's the idea behind Universal Design

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:12,680
this is a great example of that and one

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,360
thing I wanna like when I'm working with

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,909
different clients I one thing I

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,759
definitely want to make we try to make

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:21,590
them more aware that it's it's always an

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,270
afterthought just because we don't want

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,919
to be think about oh we don't want any

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,930
more features we don't want to thank so

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,759
much but honestly you are going to save

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,710
so much more time and so much more

00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,719
development just if you don't make it an

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,029
afterthought and it shouldn't be in the

00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:37,399
first place in fact it ends up creating

00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:40,289
so much more work when you need to make

00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:43,469
an app accessible after the fact

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:44,969
so now that we have like I kind of went

00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,409
through like what is accessibility and

00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:49,050
how it shouldn't be an afterthought and

00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:51,479
so on but when it comes to accessibility

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,789
when I was working on the web and making

00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,990
the web apps accessible I still kind of

00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,240
knew lot of tools and there were a lot

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,819
of block was talking about it but when I

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,399
switched to mobile specifically react

00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:04,499
native or not but it's just like I

00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,270
wanted to learn how voiceover works in

00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:09,419
general because that's all that will

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:13,319
make me aware how in general you know

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:22,800
users are using the app so let's take a

00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:28,369
quick look at a demo so my best general

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,369
back button settings back button

00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:42,959
voiceover wrong way so what what

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,479
happened is I'm going to the switch and

00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,879
turning on voiceover and every time

00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,039
you'll notice that once I hit one click

00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,749
just I press it press once it's just

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,930
going to read out the text but if I

00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:56,849
press twice it's going to invoke that

00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,899
action specifically so let's take a look

00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:04,740
at that settings accessibility court RIT

00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:06,240
voiceover zoom magnifier display and we

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,610
did a little bit of research as well and

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,469
in terms of users users always go from

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,509
like top to bottom essentially whenever

00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:15,089
the screen reader will start reading any

00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,529
of the text right so over here I'm just

00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:18,629
literally going through the list of all

00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,909
items and it's going to read out the

00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:22,979
specific label and also the state that

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:26,300
that specific label is it accommodate

00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:30,119
display speech but larger text off

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:32,519
general back button settings back button

00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:34,289
so notice one thing how it says like

00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,240
back button and so on so these are

00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,459
specific like properties that we do need

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,949
to set and just because this is a

00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,659
settings menu Apple already has that and

00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:44,790
you can kind of imagine like this being

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,889
like a flat list right essentially like

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,290
displaying all the list of elements and

00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:51,959
if you do add specific accessibility

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,640
properties to this flat list and you are

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,970
going to get accessibility

00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,120
off the bat accessibility button general

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:03,209
voiceover on access a bit voiceover

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,700
voice so just a quick example on how

00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,920
voiceovers and when I started learning

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,079
more about it honestly this itself

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,730
really helped me a lot because I saw

00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:15,060
that there are so many apps out there

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,399
and my phone that don't work and don't

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,560
perform valve and voiceover is on it

00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,370
just doesn't tell me what's going on and

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,890
it it

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:32,579
I really felt helpless and I could not

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:34,769
use my mobile phone at all so let's see

00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:37,440
how we can add accessibility to our apps

00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:39,149
and we sort of talked about from a

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,800
design perspective and then we look at

00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:46,709
some code as well so yeah be very

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,209
mindful of colors pick colors that are

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,149
already accessible with the right

00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,709
contracts and everything in skin if but

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:55,410
if there are any designers out here

00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,930
there's a tool in sketch called start

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,149
which is a guerrilla good first step

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,820
just essentially trying to check if that

00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:05,279
specific color on that background how

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,779
it's going to match and is it accessible

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,490
or not because that's a really good

00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,589
first step then you need to be aware all

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,709
right and if you said essentially set up

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:15,720
like a theme file of all colors then you

00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:17,699
can kind of see like you can always like

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,870
modify those colors as well just to make

00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:23,820
them more accessible or not and this one

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,220
too other than sketch that I really like

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,430
it's called colorable it's a great tool

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,740
for picking accessible colors so as you

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,160
can see over here I've added the hex of

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,810
the RGB color code on like whatever the

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,550
text label is going to be and on the

00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,560
right hand side is a background and it

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,690
will tell me if it's Double A or triple

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,209
a compliant obviously you should strive

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,269
for triple a but double a is also a good

00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:49,740
start right just like essentially in the

00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,810
presentation yesterday even when we are

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,339
looking at typescript we weren't like we

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,040
want we didn't want to like essentially

00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,990
go for the most strict version of it

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,300
right we always want to start with

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,130
something and then add stuff to it and

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,640
that's the same thing with accessibility

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:08,740
as well converting designers

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,600
that's in the common components so one

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,580
thing I should say about this is that

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,470
let's follow the semantics

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,320
if we fall let's say if you're using a

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,540
check box let's just use whatever

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,920
I wouldn't say check was a great example

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,200
but like for example whatever the

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,840
semantic elements are that react native

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,810
API is provided if we essentially use

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,400
those semantically what makes sense then

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,590
you're going to get accessibility off

00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,710
the bat you don't need to add patching

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,300
stuff right after that and by converting

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,190
these designers palettes into common

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,090
components what I mean by that is like

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,010
these are the different heading

00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,870
components right and if you make add

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,090
these accessibility properties and AD

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,710
wrappers around them just with the

00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,500
additional accessibility properties

00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,690
itself then you kind of get an idea

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,340
everyone all the all the developers on

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,200
your team will know because the props

00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,030
are going to prompt them that hey like

00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,190
this is a required prop accessibility

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,380
label is a required prop and so on and

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,820
we did this we kind of do this with

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,620
common components and like all our

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,110
projects just so that we can also have

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,720
the discussion with the team saying what

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,630
is optional what is not and so on so

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,310
this really helps us a lot and you might

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,920
have seen something like this in like

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,230
like all designers like sketch files or

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,880
whatever tools that they are using and

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,400
you could kind of use that and add

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:28,180
accessibility properties to it and as

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,400
you all know I love storybook so just

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,950
using storybook to help it really helps

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,170
you story book helps you develop UI

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,850
components in isolation and it can

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,190
really improve your component reuse

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,080
testability and so on and if you use

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,880
storybook to communicate you can kind of

00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,920
track off which components are actually

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,870
accessible and which components aren't

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,120
and then you can sort of see that okay

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,620
there may be like 40% there we still

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,670
need to make these additional components

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:57,430
accessible and so on

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,500
keeping animations minimal so one thing

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,470
to keep in mind is that be mindful of

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:05,290
motion if your app does have a lot of

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,840
animations maybe provide an option to

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,970
turn it off or something just because if

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,460
users are sensitive to motion effects

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,040
then it actually is going to cause a lot

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,650
of problems so for example like not just

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,290
for any specific user but like even when

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,970
I personally like feel really this

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,310
and if the animations are like really

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,660
fast and I can't really control them I

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,940
don't use the app that day and that

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,639
becomes really inconvenient so imagine

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,519
like users would actually like more

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,769
severe problems like they're going to

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,149
fairly face this right and that's why

00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,160
it's really important that we need to

00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,199
keep the animations minimal and whenever

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,350
you want to add animation just make sure

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:47,410
that there's an option to turn it off or

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,060
slow it down possibly one great thing

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,220
about react native is that you get Fon

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,980
scaling for free so as long as you use

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,019
the text component that comes from react

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,490
native from the API itself and you do

00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:59,139
not you go to your settings and turn on

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,910
font scaling it's going to increase and

00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,800
decrease the text automatically so

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:08,290
that's really great so use the text

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:12,100
api's itself this is like very important

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,449
a lot of times i see in apps that just

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,920
like we talked about right if you use

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:16,540
all the storybook components and make

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,910
those individual components accessible

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,500
that's great this that's a really good

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,540
start but what about when they are

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,940
grouped together right so let's say on a

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,380
screen how essentially those bunch of

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,600
components are going to work together

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,519
and how they are going to respond

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,670
because sometimes you don't want the

00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,560
same sort of like repetative information

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,199
all over your screen right so you want

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,480
to make sure like essentially how it's

00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,459
going to work individually versus how

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,069
it's going to work group grouped as well

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:47,139
so how when you do turn on voiceover you

00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:48,910
don't want someone to like keep like the

00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:51,310
screen leader to keep reading back back

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:55,899
again just but back once it's good

00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:57,399
enough and yeah like just like any other

00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:00,040
feature like keep making incremental

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,319
changes we don't have to essentially go

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,319
for triple-a compliant and make our app

00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:07,600
accessible from the get-go you can start

00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:10,120
adding just like as it is just like any

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,040
other feature as you start adding slowly

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,620
slowly and steadily your app becomes

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,079
accessible and obviously get designers

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,240
on board on board with on this as well

00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:22,089
just because adding those incremental

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:26,380
changes will really help reduce the

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:28,480
overhead of your work a lot so now that

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,310
is kind of like spoke about life of a

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,750
design perspective so just take a look

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,360
at some of the properties that react

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,630
native accessibility

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,550
react native provides for accessibility

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,589
so essentially like the accessibility

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,480
label this is some it's a it's a very

00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:45,120
standard property on a lot of text

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,040
elements and view wrappers as well so

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,750
what it does is whenever you add an

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,610
accessibility label it's going to

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,360
override the text that's read by the

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:57,329
screen reader accessibility true it will

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,040
read everything inside it at once but if

00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:01,079
you do have a touchable and if you add

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,550
accessibility equals true then it's not

00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,110
gonna be clickable so please make sure

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,079
that you use this property very

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,970
carefully accessibility traits so for

00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,490
example think this is specifically like

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,500
let's say a specific element is supposed

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,360
to look like a like perform like a

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,670
header then provide an accessibility

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,500
trait property of an header or image and

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,990
so on but again if you follow the

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,490
semantics essentially and if you use an

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,680
image element if you use a header

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,600
element or if you use a text element or

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,490
whatever then you're going to get that

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,779
for free so if you follow the semantics

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,240
it's a great start but if you're

00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,680
obviously we are doing sometimes more

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,350
than that so keep an eye on these

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,269
properties as well again component type

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,100
one thing I forgot to mention is

00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,500
accessibility traits is made only for

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,959
Apple or Android essentially its

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,029
accessibility component type so the type

00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,519
of selected element could be radio

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,769
button checkbox and so on and there's a

00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,930
lot more properly a lot of properties in

00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:56,220
the docs itself but this is like sort of

00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,630
to give you an idea like what are the

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,370
different properties on the components

00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,199
what I've also done is I've built a demo

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,179
because I thought that this is a great

00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,850
this is a great way just to see if I

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:12,569
want to add accessibility to an app I

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:15,299
want to show how an app performs before

00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:20,429
you add accessibility and how you add

00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:23,730
accessibility props after so this is

00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:25,500
Emma emma is a web developer and Emma's

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,240
role is essentially she wants to try and

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,880
convince her company to care more up

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,620
more about accessibility and through

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,929
that process what she does is she builds

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,510
an app and she wants to make sure that

00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:39,360
she wants to show all the users on how

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:42,360
accessibility could be added and this is

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,130
an example - this is just an example for

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,130
her company that accessibility is not

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:50,310
that hard and for as a weight

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,810
do that this is an app and again I have

00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,330
what I've done is I've done on voiceover

00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,610
let and I want to show you how the app

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,130
behaves before accessibility has been

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,770
added I mean also see how the app will

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,440
behave after and you can kind of see

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,760
like the differences and again like just

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,810
because I still give some of the

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,190
semantics and stuff it's still not bad

00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,490
it's not the worst obviously it can be

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,690
better

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,490
just to give you an example did swipe up

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,800
with three fingers to close Emin is a

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,330
web developer who wants so as you can

00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,980
see like this is just an onboarding

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:28,920
experience because I'm using the text

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,770
element it's just gonna read whatever to

00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,270
convince her company to care more

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,600
feminism feminism Emmet is a web

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:39,210
developer who wants to come

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,320
Emin is it what so what I'm doing is

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,060
essentially I'm just clicking on

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,190
different buttons just to make sure like

00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,080
exactly what that button is doing I can

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,760
hear a click but there's nothing on the

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,980
button so I'm not sure what exactly that

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:55,170
button is for now I have navigated to

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,600
another screen again I'm not really sure

00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:02,610
what's happening she is currently on a

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:05,370
mobile project and again I have no idea

00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,080
what that specific button is for what is

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,120
what it's doing as we saw in the

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,090
voiceover example when we did click back

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,440
it read it as back right similarly

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,470
there's nothing over here she is

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,340
currently on in month she is currently

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:21,480
and what I'm doing again I'm I'm

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,310
essentially navigated to the login

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,260
screen and I haven't even like got the

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,120
chance to like actually read everything

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,830
on the page because I had no idea

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,140
because the voice-over was turned on and

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,270
this is just a very basic example like I

00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,770
just use some of the semantics and we

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,840
see the code and then I add

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:44,010
accessibility properties to that code

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:46,440
and let's see how the app performs so

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,000
yeah this is just an example I have I

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,190
have added the accessibility properties

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,990
and we will see the code what this

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,640
Feeney redwood is going to do is it's

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,280
going to detect the elements which are

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,070
marked accessible otherwise it is really

00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,049
hard to know for the screen reader what

00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,850
specifically what to do specifically

00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:07,679
if you don't follow the semantics right

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:09,630
and essentially they also reinforce the

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,549
importance of accessibility as well so

00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,789
let's take a look

00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:16,200
Emmet is walking through the scene image

00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:17,850
Emmet is a web developer who wants to

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:26,250
convince her company to care more about

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:29,669
accessibility next done Emmet is with

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,190
her mobile app image she is currently on

00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:34,590
a mobile project so as you can see like

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,600
now this is giving me a lot more context

00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,490
like what does onboarding experience it

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,460
looks like right and this is just a very

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,899
basic example but our abs do have a lot

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,120
of them do have onboarding experience

00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:46,679
right and this is just an example like

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,529
how we can start making the app

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:53,539
accessible that will showcase her

00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:53,539
ability to make mobile apps accessible

00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:06,929
previous dun dun okay so let's just take

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,570
a look at an example on how some of the

00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:11,549
code looks like and on the left hand

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,679
side is the onboarding screen itself and

00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:16,020
on the right hand side is the code I

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,000
have essentially used a library called

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,610
react native app interest slider and

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,409
this is just a render item function

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,470
handler that essentially is going to

00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:27,750
render the items in the slider itself it

00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,840
takes it takes and also a slide object

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,730
and every action on the screen

00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,890
essentially is pass and handler so as

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,480
you can see except the Styles like you

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,750
can see like the rendered done button

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,289
render next button and so on this is

00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:45,330
just the setup this is like the slides

00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:47,520
object so as you can see what I'm

00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,440
passing in is a couple of prop

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,330
accessibility properties which is the

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,250
accessibility label text accessibility

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,529
label image so as you can see when you

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,149
do click an image what happens and then

00:21:55,529 --> 00:22:00,270
when you do click an image what exactly

00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,980
it's going to happen and let's take a

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,110
look at what the read when you do click

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:08,190
on the render item handler itself what

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:09,570
exactly it's going to do so as you can

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,970
see again just because I added

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,310
accessibility true to the view itself

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,730
it's going to take in accessibility

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:20,040
is going to read as that and then I

00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,750
added accessibility role as image now

00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,730
again I didn't need to do that but just

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,630
for the sake of providing an example I'm

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,610
doing it just because I used image I was

00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,410
able to like add a role sometimes it's

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,170
like if he and that's why I'm just like

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,310
I added a role whenever possible if it's

00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,100
just going to be a common component

00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,840
anyway again adding labels so we

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,850
described what the specific image is

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,370
doing and keep that in mind especially

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:47,130
like this is literally like all text

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:49,860
that we used on the web right like Aria

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:52,260
labels when we use on the web and you

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,120
don't need to be super descriptive about

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,770
what this image is doing but just to

00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,230
give the users an idea we're using

00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,900
voiceover how that images what that

00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:04,850
specific image is doing again

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:07,470
accessibility label on the text and

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,270
these are the handlers passed in so

00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,950
let's take a look at that this is the

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,530
next button so when you do press snacks

00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,870
on the screen what's gonna what what how

00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:19,710
it's going to perform so again I added

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:22,380
just because I use just a specific

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,990
library for icons just to get those

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,680
icons on the screen I didn't need to add

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,520
accessibility role labor so a button

00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,870
specifically because that they didn't

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,850
have a road right and they're going to

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:34,650
act as buttons and I added an

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,450
accessibility label next and that's why

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:40,770
when we went next we were able to see

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:43,050
kind of see that again this is the login

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,640
form itself and I didn't talk a lot

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:48,480
about it but just just give you an idea

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,610
how this form will look like I'm using a

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,220
life also I'm using a library for forms

00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:55,350
called react native paper so if you I've

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,030
noticed that whenever you use existing

00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,980
libraries that do have a lot of the

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,990
accessibility props there are a lot of

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,760
them do a good job and definitely a

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,370
shout out to react native paper for that

00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,050
just because a lot of accessibility got

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:10,200
baked in just because I was using a

00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:12,870
library that didn't use that so again

00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,930
this is the header which is a 11y and

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:18,600
accessibility login form again a text

00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:22,020
input and I've added a label enter your

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,940
user name same thing for password one

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,520
additional thing over here is also the

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,140
hint aspect so just because when you do

00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,490
click on the password feel you are

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,960
want to provide a hint that the password

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,290
needs to be six characters or so on

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,810
again no need to add a role for button

00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,340
just because I just added a label over

00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,050
here just because I'm semantically it's

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:44,190
a button so I don't need to do that

00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:45,870
additionally so yeah so these were like

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,190
this is just a very basic example right

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,380
on how we could add accessibility

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,510
different accessibility props to the

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,490
core itself and how it performs before

00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:56,220
and after just to give us like a more

00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,450
bigger picture and what's happening I

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,350
also want to share some of the lessons

00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:02,880
learned throughout through this process

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,190
so when you're using a third-party

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,810
library essentially just make sure that

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,790
it's flexible enough that you could

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:11,940
actually inject accessibility properties

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:14,250
do it just because I did when I was

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,450
building this demo I use a library for

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,060
onboarding just so that I can

00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:20,400
demonstrate accessibility right in a

00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,960
very simple way but the library itself

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,290
wasn't flexible where I could actually

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,850
add properties to it so my app my

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,130
onboarding experience was not accessible

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,750
and that's a problem right and then I

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,370
had to do additional things to inject

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,230
properties like let's just switch the

00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:36,060
library which gave me more flexibility

00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,290
and that's why it's really important to

00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,630
make sure that we actually pick a

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,520
library that's good and also like as

00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,530
open-source developers just make sure

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,410
that when you are building those

00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:49,260
libraries make them flexible for users

00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:51,600
either added yourself the properties or

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:56,280
just to make sure I add docs on it or

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,410
just like make it flexible be a little

00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,750
bit careful with accessible equals true

00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,000
essentially just because whenever you

00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,070
add that to the root level element is

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,940
kind of not gonna read what's underneath

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,890
it and bringing users attention to

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,810
errors so essentially if there is an

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,700
error on the page so let's save in a

00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,380
login form you do try to enter the user

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,360
name and password and hit submit and

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,910
it's an incorrect password for some

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,410
reason or incorrect username then make

00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:26,700
sure that you are actually calling our

00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:28,700
attention to errors as well so these are

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:32,370
some of the accessibility testing tools

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:35,070
and so accessibility scanner for Android

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,870
is and then accessibility inspector for

00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,070
Apple these are some of the tools that

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,860
could actually help improve

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,460
accessibility and you can test it out

00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,260
so for

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,610
example in my case what I did was I just

00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,130
hooked it up with accessibility

00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,409
inspector for Apple and as you can see

00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:52,529
over here on the left hand side is the

00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:53,820
text so emma is a web developer on the

00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,740
right hand side I know there's a lot

00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,409
going on but one thing I would like to

00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,240
call out is this action and the value

00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:02,429
and the type right so it's actually

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,320
telling me what is the type how the

00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:07,169
specific screen reader is going to read

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,970
it as and when you do when I do perform

00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:11,100
an action what's going to happen with

00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,899
that and also at the bottom it gives me

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,029
like a tiny tree just to give me an idea

00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:17,309
how the screen reader is reading the

00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:18,779
different elements and this is a like

00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:21,090
this is just a basic onboarding

00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:23,580
experience example right but as you add

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:26,640
like more stuff as you do have more

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:30,049
elements to it it makes it you it's more

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,080
readable and it's really helpful and

00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:36,270
lastly improve your development process

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,279
there is a linter from formidable labs

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,590
it's an ESN plugin for react native

00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,360
specifically and what it does it it will

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,850
tell you certain elements do need

00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,549
accessibility properties they you can

00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,740
also add your custom rules to it so like

00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:52,320
when you do add common components and so

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,820
on just create a new rule that this is

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,110
when these are the element this is the

00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,850
specific rule and this is a specific

00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,520
property you want them to prompt you for

00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,880
and it really helps a lot I've used it

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,549
on a few projects already and it's great

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,830
it also like certain touchable elements

00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:10,140
should have accessibility role property

00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:12,029
or both or accessibility traits and

00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,279
accessibility component type for Android

00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:16,140
or iOS there's a lot going on right and

00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:18,000
obviously we need to read the docs just

00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,549
to make sure we are good with that and

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,399
there's good testing with it but this

00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:26,490
lender is great for just getting you

00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:28,559
started I'm your love linters right it's

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:33,419
because we love ESL NTS learn plugins

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:36,000
and so on and lastly just design for

00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,789
everyone regardless of culture language

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,230
life stage ability or device

00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:43,710
accessibility is a priority and not an

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:46,620
afterthought the reality is that in

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:49,740
future or maybe even now it could be you

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,799
so it's just that keep all users in mind

00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,270
when we are thinking about accessibility

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,550
right not just space

00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:59,950
we are not segregating we should not

00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:02,020
segregate any other specific users but

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,820
keep off keep in even designing it keep

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,860
everyone in mind when we are building it

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,600
just like the curb cut effect that we

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,300
took a look at right it wasn't designed

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,520
for specific user it worked for everyone

00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:15,370
and there are design experience and we

00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:18,280
are much further ahead in our design

00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:21,400
principles and what not just to get that

00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:24,190
get accessibility working as well right

00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,900
so having said that thank you so much

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,420
that's my twitter and these are my

00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,260
slides as well which have deployed so

00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,880
yeah thank you for listening

00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:46,190
[Applause]

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:46,190
