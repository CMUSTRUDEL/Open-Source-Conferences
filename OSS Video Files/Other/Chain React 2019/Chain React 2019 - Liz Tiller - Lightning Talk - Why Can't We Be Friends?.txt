Description: 
	React Native is advertised as a framework for developing native apps with javascript. However, developing Android apps requires more effort. This talk will look at the ways in which my team and I learned, sometimes the hard way, how to develop a react native app for Android, as well as my experience as a JavaScript developer being thrust into the native world.
