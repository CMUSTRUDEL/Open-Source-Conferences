Title: Chain React 2019 - Liz Tiller - Lightning Talk - Why Can't We Be Friends?
Publication date: 2019-08-06
Playlist: Chain React 2019
Description: 
	React Native is advertised as a framework for developing native apps with javascript. However, developing Android apps requires more effort. This talk will look at the ways in which my team and I learned, sometimes the hard way, how to develop a react native app for Android, as well as my experience as a JavaScript developer being thrust into the native world.

hey everyone I'm also the woman who lost

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,160
her wallet on Bourbon Street on her

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,820
honeymoon so you all know a lot about me

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,260
at this point I am a developer with DXE

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,180
technology but I'm gonna be talking

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,609
about last year when I was working for a

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,490
company called mad Mobile and we were

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,289
building a react native app for Cisco

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,989
and I always like to correct because

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,550
sometimes people think I'm talking about

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,219
Cisco with the sea I'm talking about

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,489
Cisco with an S that's the food ordering

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,890
service I don't know if Cisco uses react

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,379
native they might Cisco with the sea but

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,360
the with the s they do this is the

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,800
glamorous side of what you eat I'm

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,809
pretty sure almost every food you eat

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,829
when you go out has been ordered through

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:58,440
Cisco it's not the most beautiful of

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,469
apps but it was a great honor to be able

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,960
to work building one for a fortune 100

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,880
company and that this was being built to

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,610
replace an app that Mad mobile had

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,680
previously created that does about 4

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,760
billion in revenue annually so it was a

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,479
big deal yeah I heard that whistle so

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,560
what's up with react native and Android

00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:24,930
how many people have ever had issues

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,970
with the Android builds yeah yeah so

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,030
this talk actually began after our

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,340
designer gave me this UI audit that she

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,049
had done of our Android version of the

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,630
app and she was like here's all these

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,520
changes I love UI UX that's my favorite

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,880
thing I love going in there and fixing

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,710
all of it and I could not even get our

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,540
build to start that day I was having

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,640
issues with Gradle how many people have

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,409
had issues with Gradle yeah I couldn't

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,560
get the environment to start it took

00:01:52,409 --> 00:02:00,810
over an hour I was also I I have an

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,369
iPhone so our our simulator was acting a

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,530
little wonky so I had to go get that get

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,329
this test device and I've never used an

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,530
Android phone so like I'm really you're

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,759
probably wondering why I'm even talking

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,909
about this at this point

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,790
but this got me thinking about last year

00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:18,670
those infamous air B&B medium articles

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,769
that came out last summer how many read

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,970
this the the reason they were sunsetting

00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:26,980
react native so this brought out I'm in

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,200
Tampa Bay and it brought out all the

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,390
react native skeptics like people were

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,849
like oh this is why you don't use it air

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,670
B&B is not gonna use it

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:39,940
one such local Tampa Bay skeptic later

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,819
told me a few months after that that he

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,530
was ready to eat crow for what he said

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,720
because he was now working with react

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,660
native and thought it was great

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,879
of course this led me to a question of

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,470
are the reason what are their reasons

00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,930
for sunsetting it should they be are

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,900
reasons to be skeptical of using it how

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,450
is this going to affect us so as a

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,680
review air being bees goals and there's

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,269
sunset reasons they said they did not

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,579
hit these goals and that's why they Sun

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,010
were Sun setting it was that they wanted

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:12,549
to move faster maintain their quality

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:15,120
bar write code once instead of twice and

00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:18,370
to improve the developer experience I

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,269
will say my team hit all those goals

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:25,750
that we were able to do some fantastic

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:28,269
cutting-edge stuff but we have some

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,000
reservations and it usually came down to

00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:33,340
the Android side of things also when I

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,040
was here last year I remember hearing

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,540
quite a few companies that no longer did

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,480
react native for Android they were

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,099
continuing it with iOS and so this got

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,910
me thinking and I started talking to my

00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:47,769
team and our perspective was that some

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,260
of the biggest issues come down to JSX

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,169
sensitivity configuration for custom

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,500
modules styling and animations and an

00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:57,790
iOS first mentality so I want to say

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,120
that from what I've been hearing from

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,709
the talks and people who work with react

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,419
native core and all of it it sounds like

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,449
a lot of things are being fixed this is

00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,370
based off of last year so if things are

00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:11,859
changing I'm not trying to like make

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:15,780
digs at anyone so apologize in advance

00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:18,190
but the first thing was JSX sensitivity

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,469
we had so many issues we had to be very

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,820
explicit with errant nulls with the

00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:25,550
short circuit operators I spent

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,590
a whole two weeks sprint going through

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,870
and having to change the double and

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,940
operator and actually turn them into

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,120
Turner ease because while iOS was very

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,250
forgiving Android wasn't and I'm hearing

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,870
I'm hearing some like uh-huh yeah I'm

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,540
hearing that I'm hearing some people

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,040
agreeing with this so I spent two weeks

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,710
cleaning that up and then I spent

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,980
another two weeks print on all the PRS

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:52,100
going stop it don't do that I've told

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:55,010
you not to sometimes developers don't

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,490
like to listen I say that as someone who

00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,530
doesn't like to listen sometimes we also

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,330
run into configuration for custom

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,190
modules one of the things we were doing

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,290
was that we needed to provide keyboard

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,600
shortcuts and we needed to be able to

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,100
provide control and command because we

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,450
were trying to replicate a desktop

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,430
experience so when we did that we had to

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,870
detach from expo we were originally

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,690
based on when the project started locked

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,520
in with Expo and Expo actually warns you

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,310
they tell you you really don't want to

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,250
detach from us we had to because we

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,420
needed to make these custom modules and

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,460
unfortunately that meant then every time

00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,890
there was an update that one of our

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,270
senior devs had to spend like two days

00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,280
just trying to get everything back up

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,950
and running cuz it just wanted to crash

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,440
everything has anyone detached from expo

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,850
and had those experiences I see a few

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:50,180
hands if you haven't you're lucky

00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:52,730
so styling and animations I always say

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,890
that you need to embrace the ones that

00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,650
it comes with or be prepared to debug

00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:01,580
and work natively I gave a version of

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,960
this talk at Google's deaf Fest in

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,790
Orlando which was kind of entertaining

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,150
being the react native person talking

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,800
about it to people talking about flutter

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,230
and I was like this is all probably very

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,390
easy for you all to just go in and make

00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,250
all these changes but I'm a JavaScript

00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,410
developer I went to code school I've

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,020
only ever while I've worked in rails and

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,270
ColdFusion but that's another story

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,190
but like I know react I know JavaScript

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,740
that's my primary language I've never

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,600
done native and so having to go in and

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,060
dig into these things and trying to make

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,380
the adjustments was very slow and

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:39,200
arduous this is just an example this

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,910
second one was how Android handles

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,690
certain sizing and font weights

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,820
differently

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,700
we had these stylings all over the app

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,500
because I had to go in and it was not as

00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,360
bold as it needed to be or the size

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,810
wasn't the right size on the text and

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,690
that we just wrote all these is android

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,920
turner 'is all over the place

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,650
further example was when we started

00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,440
trying to finally accommodate android

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,690
tablet and this is just for us to say is

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,210
it android and is it a tablet we had to

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,510
write all these custom all this custom

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:15,590
code in there and it just got very

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:19,190
expensive timewise and finally I think

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,980
the biggest thing with our project was

00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,920
an iOS first mentality our client was

00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:28,220
iOS focused that custom module with the

00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,620
keyboard shortcuts my teammate built it

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,720
out it worked great on iOS he never got

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,180
it working fully functionally on Android

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,920
because our client didn't really care

00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,080
that wasn't their priority they wanted

00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,660
us to get other things done first my

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,950
team was also iOS focused as I said I

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,530
have an iPhone

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:48,050
we had one person who had an Android

00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:51,350
phone and then we had two people who had

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,360
Android tablets and in fact my lead

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,070
developer on the team he brought in his

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,540
own Android tablet so we could actually

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,710
do a lot of this debugging because our

00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,400
company didn't have enough of those

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:05,090
lying around and also our designer was

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,310
iOS focused during that audit she

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,420
actually came to me and was when I was

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,100
like well how do you want me to do this

00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,670
and she goes just make it look like iOS

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,290
which if you've ever tried to do a

00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,750
toggle button and tried to make the

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:21,740
Android one look exactly like the iOS

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:25,420
one it's not easy it's not gonna happen

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,500
and so that was something that we all

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:32,330
Android was always that afterthought

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:34,160
basically I also will say that I find

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,680
that sometimes that react native itself

00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,030
is iOS first in its mentality there was

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,219
many times when I was trying to debug

00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:43,700
something for Android and ultimately it

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,560
came down to well it hasn't been built

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,750
out on the Android side yet but it's

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,400
working in iOS again I'm not trying to

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,910
make a dig at anyone who works on react

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,470
native

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,080
that's just something that I have

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,960
noticed so when I brought when I

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,490
presented this at Google dev fest

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,060
ultimately the question is is react

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,490
native worth it for Android I 100% say

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,020
yes going back to those goals we were

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,870
able to move faster than Cisco's

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,820
in-house devs we set and maintained the

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,430
quality bar for when we handed it over

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,260
in January we wrote code once instead of

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,030
twice except for those custom modules

00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,670
and it improved the developer experience

00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:22,010
I never would have dreamed that I'd be

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,020
making an actual native app I like I

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,450
said I came from rails and cold fusion I

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,160
had studied react that was it I never

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,140
thought I would get to this point or at

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,230
least not within two years of finishing

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,480
code school so I always tell people to

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,640
keep in mind that react native isn't a

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,800
replacement and it's not going to turn

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,780
JavaScript developers into native

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,040
developers I have a lot of times people

00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,810
go oh you've built an app you're a

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,360
native developer and I go no no no I

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,770
know JavaScript and I know react I know

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,710
that really well I'm not a native

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:54,560
developer have I made a native app 100%

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,840
though ideally a team would include at

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,780
least one Android and one iOS dev for

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,040
support and looking back on it the

00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,050
biggest thing would be to plan for those

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,270
differences if I could go back I would

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,030
go to our designer and say I need

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,800
Android and iOS from the get-go don't

00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,300
try and tell me to make it look like iOS

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,970
it's not happening so those are my tips

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,470
for working with it this could be a much

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,330
longer talk but we're just doing 10

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,000
minutes and I would like to end it with

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,310
my many cats because I was called out

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,810
earlier kenseth doesn't even know me but

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,940
she called me out about having cat

00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,450
pictures so there you go

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,960
thank you I'm Liz tiller

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:44,980
[Applause]

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:44,980
