Publication date: 2019-08-06

Description: 
	This talk is about my journey in building an app that will keep track of your gym life. One single codebase and React Native. Only one person making an app for both Android and iOS that goes from zero to production till seeing your gym buddy using it.

This talk is based in my popular Tweet https://twitter.com/ferrannp/status/1017477385422299136 and my passion in building apps as a hobby.

I plan to cover:

- Database-offline solution
- UI library & theme
- Orientation & multiple layouts support
- i18n
- Navigation & deep linking
- Accessibility & RTL support
- Premium features & monetization
- Release to store & beta releases
