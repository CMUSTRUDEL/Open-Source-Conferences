Title: Chain React 2019 - Ferran Negre Pizarro - React Native - Case study: From an idea to the market
Publication date: 2019-08-06
Playlist: Chain React 2019
Description: 
	This talk is about my journey in building an app that will keep track of your gym life. One single codebase and React Native. Only one person making an app for both Android and iOS that goes from zero to production till seeing your gym buddy using it.

This talk is based in my popular Tweet https://twitter.com/ferrannp/status/1017477385422299136 and my passion in building apps as a hobby.

I plan to cover:

- Database-offline solution
- UI library & theme
- Orientation & multiple layouts support
- i18n
- Navigation & deep linking
- Accessibility & RTL support
- Premium features & monetization
- Release to store & beta releases

alright hello everybody so yeah I want

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,230
to talk about an application I built

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,470
today and show you some parts of it but

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,490
first let me quick introduce myself if I

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,500
can do it better than just happen here

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,869
yeah so my name is Farah I work as an

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,700
engineer at call stack so basically to

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,320
sum up I've been writing react native

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,030
for the past three years yeah part from

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,940
consultancy that we do we also

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,829
contribute to open source library such

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,640
react native paper or we hang native

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,649
itself and I'm such a fun guy that you

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,760
know when I go home after working I keep

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:57,300
coding I did this small application for

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,219
for when I go to the gym and that's what

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,600
I want you to show you today it's called

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,580
fit hero so the first thing is why why I

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
did this or some people is why why you

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,979
do something like this and for me the

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,500
answer is it's quite simple so this is

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,619
like a need for me it's a necessity and

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,900
I also like writing react native apps so

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,820
I told to people you know I like going

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,619
to gym and at the end they told me what

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,890
you like is using the phone in the gym

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:30,390
so so I go this this app but I think

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,520
jokes aside the the Y is mostly it might

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,640
sound a bit salty but it needs to be

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,560
useful for me so this is also going to

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,240
date the open source so if it's not

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,159
useful for me I would probably not work

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,409
on it or I will keep I will abandon a

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,479
tank I know that some of my friends are

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,060
also interested in this so it might be

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,060
useful for them and maybe one day will

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,009
be useful for somebody else but I think

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,450
most important for you is what is the

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,899
goal for these talk so what I want to

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,340
show you today and I realize that every

00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:03,090
every topic I will introduce you today

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,060
it's it's around those goals here so

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,970
it's about making the app feel and look

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,370
native this was like kind of my primary

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,560
goal and to avoid the users and

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,990
installing the app so

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,760
this kind of a guy when I install an app

00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,280
I see it and in less than a minute if I

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,760
don't like it I remove it so that would

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,190
be the goal today so I prepared this

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,170
table of contents it's not like a random

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,140
order here so everything goes from when

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,030
you download an app and when you first

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,940
open it the app start at time how it

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,250
looks how it feels and then how it works

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,160
I added a couple of things like the

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:43,310
state persistence and using the platform

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,220
that will show you - and then I will

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,560
talk a bit about releasing it to the App

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:52,130
Store and Play Store and and a few words

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,430
of open source so what about app start a

00:02:52,130 --> 00:03:00,110
time I think we have talked about it

00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:03,709
this morning little bit so I'll try to

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,480
be brief but if I like to be clear that

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,980
for me you know if you if you are

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,390
building a native app or you're building

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,720
a react native app if you're doing it

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,100
well it might take a bit more time to

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,140
open the react native app because there

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,730
is an overhead so so with that I want to

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,440
say that you even need to be more

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,690
careful right when you're developer a

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,209
native app to make it fast and I think

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,100
the react native team it's it's aware of

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,940
that because they are working in things

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:32,269
like turbo models fabric and also MMS

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,010
right so I think people take this series

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:36,470
but I don't want to talk about the

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:40,070
future but the present or or when I did

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,620
this right so it's real quick probably

00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,120
you're familiar with this when you do

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,519
react native in it right now

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,220
maybe you uh trained it in navigation

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,220
right some screens when you open your

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,150
app it might look something like this

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,310
because this is the default background

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,660
something like white and then when the

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,489
AJ is ready you will see that the

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,090
content and as you can see my app has

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:05,450
this blue background and it doesn't look

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,730
really nice right and it's quite easy to

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,950
just google how how do I change that and

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,650
you need a couple of native changes in

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:15,260
the here it's it's for Android I will

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,940
show more Android staff because of the

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,340
time we have here but the same concepts

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,690
apply with iOS so if you go about it you

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,120
will find something like this which is

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,849
not even Java it's like JSX kind of

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,330
thing right and the first color is for

00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,830
this

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,780
that was where you saw there that was

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,069
gray and the other one is what it says

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,900
the window bug room so we changed this

00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:34,009
white color right and then we get

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,129
something like this

00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:39,129
which still looks it looks better no

00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:42,169
like the small thing look a bit better

00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:44,389
still there is an empty screen there and

00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:46,009
it feels like nothing is happening so I

00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:47,780
was thinking okay what to do and you are

00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,699
probably thinking you have to show maybe

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,879
it splash screen is good for branding

00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,470
and so on so because I think react

00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,240
native at the end is a native app I was

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,940
looking how how to do this on Android

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,340
how to do it natively so I watch this

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,020
video I apply the concept instead of

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,090
using a color as background you use an

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,580
image as background so you got something

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,319
like this and what is interesting here

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,830
is that the first time I open the app I

00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:14,900
see the splash screen let's see it again

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,580
and then when maybe if it's ready it

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,979
will remove it and still I will see this

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,810
empty background then the J is ready

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:23,150
will show the content so I'm almost

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,870
there following those instructions from

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:29,509
from the native people but not ready yet

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,719
so what did I do to achieve this detail

00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:35,560
I wanted so as I said I used this image

00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:38,150
as window background and then I had to

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,190
fortunately or not maybe for me it's not

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,349
but I had to change some native code so

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,110
what I did is created a native me with

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:47,930
XML that it looks the same as the image

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,389
background and then a small native model

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,979
to tell you native am I'm ready when the

00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,960
JavaScript is ready you can send some

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:57,469
signals to native and then we will show

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,969
that and in this point where where you

00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:00,590
write something native for me it's a

00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:02,960
static splash screen but here you could

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,330
have know a nice animation that will

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,789
maybe fade when the JavaScript comes and

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,039
goes I don't know the toolbar something

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:12,409
so I just did a fade animation here and

00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,090
yeah what what I had to do is after you

00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:16,039
do the react native in it

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,349
I had to overwrite this react activity

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,529
that comes with and expose a native

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:23,210
model to switch views and I achieve

00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,009
something like that so I will show now

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,520
the the production version which is a

00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:30,349
bit faster right and you will see the

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,789
splash game appearing and then there is

00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:36,130
a nice animation and I didn't do any

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:38,270
performance improvement nothing like

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,110
improving an algorithm or making it

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,030
faster but it kind of looks

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:47,910
better and feels faster than the

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:50,160
previous one you had here so it's

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,900
basically this the summary of this talk

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,190
I'm gonna show you like the small native

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,590
things that I feel makes the app better

00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:01,200
so yeah it took quite a lot of time to

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,600
open the app but let's see how is the

00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,150
next step and this one is about styling

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:11,340
and theming so as I as I told you I I

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:14,190
cannot come from angry background before

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,020
going to react and I also work in reg

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,480
native paper which is a reg native

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,840
library for material design that works

00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,600
on Android and iOS so this is the one I

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,130
chose I did this app alone you know and

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,710
I didn't have like the design team or

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:31,350
not my idea of design principles so I

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,210
choose something that is there so it's

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,160
about reg native paper you can you can

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,350
check it out and I always say about

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,920
paper you know that it has these three

00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,600
key concepts and it might seem not

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,910
important but it really makes a

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,500
difference so this platform adaptation

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,240
for theming support and accessibility

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,640
and right to life support that I will

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,830
tell you what is about so platform

00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,730
adaptation mmm when you use this library

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,500
when you use a button or or text it will

00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,030
it will look how the material design is

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,740
telling you that it needs to look also

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,530
in iOS so for example here you have the

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,940
Save button on the top so by default for

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,930
under it has a background have an

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,580
uppercase text on yes it's our case also

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,350
there is this title is a bit cheating

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,420
because this is rank navigation so they

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,130
also provide you with the platform

00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,840
adaptation because this title is Center

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,000
in under it is not then we have the

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,770
radio buttons from paper so they look

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,450
how they need to look on Android and iOS

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,690
they look like checks and all that is

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:29,550
based from Google guide so it's also in

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,550
paper and there is also about

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,890
accessibility so thing is paper

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,320
components are accessible so for example

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,210
here I use the bottom navigation and if

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,860
you would use a screen reader it will

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,810
tell you this is the first stop from 3

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,010
it's a button you can navigate to home

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:49,020
and the important thing of this is so

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,220
you when you create your own components

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,690
you still need to make them accessible

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,910
but

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,460
it was easier for me sorry it was easier

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,590
for me because paper already and I use a

00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,020
lot of them and the real problem is that

00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,870
if you use a components library that is

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,370
not accessible it might be not possible

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,890
to make it accessible if you cannot pass

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,770
the right props right so so paper give

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,800
you that and also what what about this

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:17,340
full theming sup or why why I think this

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,220
is important so I think this dark theme

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:23,100
came recently right there is the Android

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,650
cue offering it so so dark teen has been

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,380
under it for quite a while and now with

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,970
under BQ they introduced like a full

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,580
dark theme for all your you know your

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,800
settings all the every apart from apps

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,050
and then the iOS 13 also brings it so I

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,750
was thinking it would be nice to offer a

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,580
full white version of the apps or you

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,570
know battery purposes to save battery

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,400
and with paper was quite easy basically

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,550
you you have a provider from reg native

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,250
paper and you pass a theme theme is use

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,860
some colors and and settings so in paper

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,660
we already offer the like team and dark

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,330
theme so you can pass the dark theme and

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,460
override maybe some primary color for

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,130
your branding and then we have this high

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,830
order component with pin so you can use

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,780
that in your own components and you will

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,120
get the theme by props and when you

00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,340
change that all all your app will be

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,650
updated so so basically I created a

00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,470
setting for that and when you change it

00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:23,160
it goes to the default theme to full

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:26,520
black and it was almost there but as you

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,290
can see the the toolbar was it not and

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,750
it's because I'm using react navigation

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:34,680
but bear with me because I was like

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,060
enough to go to address in Krakov and I

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,580
was talking to brain about this and

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,760
actually he came up with a guide in reg

00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,530
navigation because this is possible and

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,420
I suggest you to take a look but

00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,510
basically you have to use these screen

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,070
props from from react navigation that

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,640
you pass to your outer more Navigator

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,920
right and then basically in every screen

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,790
you can access a screen prop theme and

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,840
you can update your tuber so we that we

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,340
we are almost done but I want to be like

00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,260
pixel perfect here and all

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,580
so especially for Android if you change

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,260
the theme you also need to take care of

00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,710
the status bar and reignite if already

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,360
has it

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,750
I think it's attractive now but anyway

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,190
you can use it imperative it way I

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,220
haven't found a reason to use that word

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:23,310
declarative but you can do this and then

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,590
you will get full black support there

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,990
and it actually works for Android and

00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,090
and for iOS and in thing it's pretty

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,730
cool that it was so easy to do and not

00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:36,150
only that but there is a concept you

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:38,220
know about 9mo or battery saver so for

00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,060
example we have read it up I'm pretty

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,880
sure you know it

00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,700
and when you activate this battery saver

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:49,320
on Android in this case the app goes

00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:51,540
full black so it will not so much

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,150
battery and then when when you change it

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:59,010
again to the default theme light it will

00:11:54,150 --> 00:12:00,810
come back so if you again this app it's

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,360
a native app at the end of the day you

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,580
can have a listener native model and

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,500
when you activate this battery saver it

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,020
will go full black and when you

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,150
deactivate it it will go to default him

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,310
and I don't want to say that it works

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:20,810
better than ready but I think it works

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:23,490
pretty cool so so yeah so we saw them

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,930
when the app starts and how it looked

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,750
and feels so let's say that the user

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,710
still like it and keeps using it and

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,900
then I want to talk about a

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,820
functionality not the core of an of an

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,440
app and I guess all of them are

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,780
different but this one is all about

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,670
going to the gym do some training and

00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,470
write your your progress in there so

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,110
it's all about saving data and showing

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:48,390
it to you in a in a nice way so I needed

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:50,370
a data base and somehow when I look for

00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,260
data base that way for Ag natives out

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,920
there it's the most popular thing is

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,510
about critics and Redux persist and

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,400
maybe it's because I'm coming from from

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:03,690
Navy if I didn't see a point to you know

00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,850
using that because it's all about mmm

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:09,540
saving everything into memory serialize

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,730
it and restore it and I think that's not

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,920
the real point of of data base and I

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,690
actually wanted to use something from

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,310
the native side so I'm more about

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,840
talking about SQLite or

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,380
you know versus no relation and doing

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,200
queries on the native side and so the

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:30,010
moment I did do that whoops sorry the

00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,010
moment I did this app there was like one

00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,630
two solutions there was real there was a

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,970
watermelon DB was starting but not

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,160
really couldn't find more because I

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,770
think majority of companies or the

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,450
companies I work with they have a

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,430
brownfield lab they have like already

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,500
some some native database and and and

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,050
they create bridges right so everywhere

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:55,029
has the user case but I use real as you

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:57,610
saw before and it worked pretty okay for

00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:59,529
me you know it they keep updating the

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,180
app they are very responsive they keep

00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:04,660
updating with the latest react native

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:08,260
version and sometimes that's not that

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,100
easy from maintainer and with realme it

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,360
works right now so it has all this I

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,050
really like it because it has a similar

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,200
concept that Flags had so it's a very

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:22,780
reactive in a way that you have one

00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,300
single data flow so you write into the

00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,089
database you can have listeners that did

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,820
update it for the specific queries you

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:34,900
can sort you can filter and and so on

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:36,310
and about backup and restore I will also

00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,640
talk because I think it's important but

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,860
before I want to thank reg native-like

00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:46,450
hooks because I was in react conf and

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:49,030
when I was doing this app I was handling

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:53,040
this database with III I felt smart to

00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:55,690
write a high order component which it

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,610
didn't work well because I wanted to do

00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,980
more than one query or query depending

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,570
on each other so I end up updating this

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,470
high order component more than the code

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:07,390
then I thought I'm gonna write data

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,060
provider component that render of snow

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:12,370
and it will take care it will feel smart

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,529
to use a declarative and then I end up

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,120
needed to use component will receive

00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,700
probes because when I change an argument

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,740
from the query needed to and then the

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,220
component receive probes was deprecated

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,690
so anyway I wrote this this hook here I

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,780
hope there are no mistakes but basically

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,390
is making a query that's a listener so

00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,160
when this listen risky do executed

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,500
function and then it removes listener

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,110
when it's a mounted and it depends on

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,510
the on the query so if you change the

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,670
the query it will do all the component

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,710
will receive probe thingie so I'll not

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,120
explain that how it works but it's very

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,980
well to explain the react conf and

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,530
basically then in my components they get

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,380
pretty simple right they could do any

00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:55,150
kind of query all together those queries

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,240
can depend on each other so here for

00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:00,490
example if if this type if this type

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,700
will change this will rerun again and it

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:06,040
will just work and with that I didn't

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,290
found any any problems with with it and

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,300
I just want to show you how basically

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,660
the app work so you have an empty screen

00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,460
and you could add some exercise and

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,820
everybody look likes to go to gym and do

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,280
some squats right so here we when we

00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,320
click add there is a listener here that

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,390
will get updated from database so it's

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,250
not going I don't know to the local

00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,170
state or redox or anything

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,580
in the history it will also be updated

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,980
and then when we go back to the previous

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:36,180
screen there is also listeners so as you

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:39,730
can see it works pretty pretty fast and

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:42,820
and it's prettier like reacted cancer

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,850
and so if you don't want to you know

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,170
because I think bridging your own

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:51,160
database solution in iOS and Android is

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:52,330
is not easy so realm did pretty good job

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,650
in my opinion if you need a non

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:58,600
relational database so what about backup

00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,770
and restore and that is the last step

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,280
here mmm

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:05,770
so thing is I didn't find many react

00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,720
native apps about that and so what

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,339
happens if you use this app you you keep

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,579
adding that data there and after one

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:15,220
year you switch your phone or or got

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:17,079
lost and you loss all the data and I I

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,100
know what will happen so you will go to

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,100
the store and you do this

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:31,470
so here I want to thank to Expo because

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:33,660
I said the veining I started this up

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,990
with react native in it so at that time

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,400
if you do that you couldn't use any cold

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,890
from you couldn't use any model from

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,350
Expo and this is not true anymore

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,330
because there is relative Uni models

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,700
which is like a collection huge of

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:52,110
native models so from there I could use

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:55,169
file system and document picker so just

00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:58,760
to to handle files and to read and write

00:17:55,169 --> 00:18:02,010
them so so with that it was pretty ok to

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:05,549
to create this backup section here so I

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,390
can I could save it I know we will drive

00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,890
I can send it in

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,200
telegram if I want if somebody wants to

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:13,679
use it and then I can I can go to an

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,289
iPhone phone and I can use this document

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,500
picker from Expo and I can just restore

00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:21,090
it and what is important from here what

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,970
is nice from here is that you are owning

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,919
your data right I I don't force you to

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,460
login to signup to synchronize it

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,380
somewhere so somehow you can save it you

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,570
can even this is just a JSON file that

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,460
you can use if you want and I know the

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,200
next step the next step would be to do

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,000
this automatically on the background but

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,409
at least there is a way to do it and not

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,440
lose your data so so with that we

00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:47,940
covered a lot of stuff here and the

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,520
other things are like those little

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,400
things that I notice when using the app

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,980
because I'm I'm using like a lot of

00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,520
times per per week and if you do that

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,679
you would notice some stuff and I don't

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,130
want to talk a lot of navigation here

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,690
but just about state persistence and

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:13,080
navigation is kind of related mm-hm

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:15,090
so let me let me show you this this pure

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,340
native app it's it's called a profile so

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:21,480
I wrote this in a pure Java back in the

00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:23,580
day and you know when when you in I use

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,909
it my were the same but on Android I can

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:29,700
explain that when you open the app and

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:31,049
go to some screen I don't know this is

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,120
the text input widget you write

00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:34,259
something then there is the slider which

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,809
you change it

00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:39,759
and then you're using the app you will

00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,259
minimize it and maybe you open some

00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,269
other apps like I don't know Facebook or

00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:46,059
Instagram and they required memory

00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:49,479
consuming the thing is that when you do

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:53,080
that at some point Android my decide to

00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:54,879
to free resources and and then when you

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,739
come back to the app it's it's the

00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:58,299
native site responsible to restore all

00:19:56,739 --> 00:20:01,119
the state so it will restore the screen

00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:04,629
where the widgets the position the text

00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:07,149
so this is a common - to simulate the

00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:08,710
Android destroying your app so you can

00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:09,909
write diagonals with your package name

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,830
and then when you open it you will see

00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:14,499
that it starts again but I was I'm in

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:17,619
the point when I was before so after

00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:20,139
using it here on Jim for a while I

00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:22,719
realized this was pretty annoying it was

00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:25,089
not happening like that so so in a real

00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:27,369
native app the way it's built the way

00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:29,859
it's the pregnat if the native code is

00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:32,200
it's written and the native doesn't

00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:34,419
persist or restore the state so it's

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,690
supposed to be the java scripts is

00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:40,450
supposed to be for the JavaScript to

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:44,169
take care of it so of course if I if I

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:46,479
show you this one here I open it I go to

00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:48,609
another screen I search for for some

00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:50,349
exercise I will minimize it in the gym

00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:55,359
of course I will be in an Instagram for

00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:57,369
half an hour and when I open it it will

00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,320
not be where it was and to be honest

00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:02,200
this was really annoying for me so so

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,669
there are two things here which is I'm

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,499
using rare navigation so I want to

00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:06,969
persist the navigation state and I want

00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:09,099
to persist maybe some other stay like

00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:10,989
this search query here right so if we

00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:14,259
are for real navigation it's pretty easy

00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:16,509
they expose this persist navigation stay

00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:18,009
at low navigation state now so you can

00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,719
save it whatever you want you can do it

00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:22,179
in the example is done in the icing

00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:24,429
storage but you can pretty use I don't

00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,440
know sure preference or or any anything

00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:28,899
you like to save it and then you can

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,059
restore it and where I restore it is

00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,349
well the splash screen is showing so one

00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:33,909
nice thing of the splash screen is that

00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:37,539
you can do all the duty work there that

00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:39,249
you need before removing it but that was

00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:41,200
not enough because as you saw on the on

00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:44,139
the pure Android example there was the

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,150
it was persisting widgets also so I

00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:48,940
decided how to do this

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,970
you might think just save it all the

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,980
time but I kind of did it a bit

00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,990
different so I use this upstate model

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,880
this is a model from from react negative

00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,050
that it's actually a listener that tells

00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,990
you when the app goes into the

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,970
background and I put this listener for

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,680
every screen and every screen decides

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,200
what part of the state for that screen

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,690
is saved so I saved that state with a

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,280
timestamp I don't know how how long do

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,570
you if you if you go to gym and you

00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,430
train probably you are like four hours

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:19,720
there so you can use this time stimuli

00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:22,090
for hours and I decide to if you open

00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,610
the app you check this timestamp with

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,400
this limit these four hours and if it's

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:29,170
smaller you restore it if not not and I

00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,810
don't want to share all the code but

00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:34,780
I'll share it with you like after the

00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:38,290
talk it will be all for you so basically

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:41,170
with that I can actually it actually

00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:43,390
works like you will look for something

00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,490
you will minimize it so reallocation

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,620
takes care of the screens I take care of

00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,030
the widgets they are native widgets at

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,070
the end of the day right so here I

00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:54,400
simulate I kill it and when I open it I

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,870
will be where I was and I haven't found

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,790
a lot of information of people doing

00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,950
this but I tell you if you use the app

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:02,230
like every day you could notice this and

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,920
I'm using a pixel to which I think it's

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:08,740
not like me 200 phone and it happens a

00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,990
lot so one is this is one of the things

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,610
the other things which is also one of my

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,930
favorites a bit contribution is like

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:20,140
about using the platform so I think it I

00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:22,420
actually told you a lot about using some

00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,240
native code using a little things that

00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:28,510
are native so actually you can use the

00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,170
the native platform and I have this to

00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:34,210
it from I I actually asked information

00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:36,340
that you don't have to use just all the

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,290
time you can use native it makes sense I

00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,660
also would say you can use native if you

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,180
are not in the mood to rewrite it in

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,540
JavaScript and I would you know stick it

00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:49,120
to remember

00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:51,850
so one example like real quick shorts so

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,920
so as I told you in this app I I saved a

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:56,410
ton I want to show it in a nice way so I

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,990
want to use charts so I've been asking

00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,910
around in my team what to use for charts

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:03,220
yeah they said no there are some some

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,780
libraries out there some J's solution is

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,110
kind of solution because you have to

00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,250
link really native SVG so I have I got

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,750
the tones of problem there with

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:16,120
non-native animations slow to load at

00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,160
the beginning when I was clicking this

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,700
chart if this was inside a scrollview I

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,490
had a lot of problems so they told me

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,740
you could use a rag native air air tea

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:30,040
so the problem was that when I was doing

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:32,200
this this package was not extracted yet

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,720
so it was kind of a dark place without

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,920
documentation or anything so I didn't go

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,630
and go there

00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:44,920
somebody told me why don't you use a web

00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:48,250
B who then would be with III and stuff

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:51,160
and I said no and then I said why if I

00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:52,750
use negative light because I have native

00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,660
apps my phone they have some beautiful

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:58,000
charts can I use them and I think yes

00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,070
because still native out right and I

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,160
wrote here that there are silent heroes

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:06,640
out there I was looking for like the

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,270
most popular native libraries I found

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,520
those too

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,800
this is the Android one and iOS and they

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,620
have like more than 20,000 k-stars so I

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,210
was thinking probably they are good but

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,280
yeah here if you want to bridge them you

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,559
need knowledge of unwritten iOS right

00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,200
but I found this signing here oh this

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,240
package here which has a super beautiful

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,630
name it's pretty clear from a relative

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,580
chart wrapper and it's actually a

00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:33,670
wrapper to those two native libraries

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,950
with a common API so with that I was

00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:38,020
able to you know create those graphs I

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:42,940
could do native animations I could pinch

00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:48,790
I could zoom I could do anything and it

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:51,670
worked pretty well so it means like yeah

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:54,100
and this one is also pretty nice does it

00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:55,570
mean that if you want to use you want to

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,150
create charts in your app you need to

00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,360
use native code I think no but like what

00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,250
my whole point is

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,990
that you have the choice like you have

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,670
the choice to use their solution your

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,460
app you can use a web view you can use

00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:10,270
native tour right and I kind of want to

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,500
say that when you do react native in it

00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:15,290
usually we say in grainy divinities a

00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,120
green feel up but I think it's not it's

00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,470
actually a brown feel you have access to

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,260
the native code and you can do all that

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:24,380
stuff so if you feel lazy you know to

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,710
write it in JavaScript or or that kind

00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,830
of stuff

00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,000
you have the choice here okay so so

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,610
before going to the moon which is

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,190
actually the Play Store real quick what

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:38,419
about in this work is so complicated for

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:40,400
me this is about offering your app in

00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:44,690
different languages right so I told you

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,179
I come from from Andhra world and I work

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,910
in a lot of apps and all the tags are

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:51,440
hard-coded and when you work in the

00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,790
native code and you hard-code the text

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,380
you've got this warning like why are you

00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,600
doing this you can not translate it so I

00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,669
found pretty easy to offer my opinion in

00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,049
different languages so so you can use

00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:01,640
the react native localize this is a

00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:03,290
package from reg native community you

00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,740
need that and this is a native model

00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:08,120
just to know what is the language of

00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,830
your phone what is the language the user

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,299
is using right and then when you know

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,010
that you can use any translation

00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:14,510
JavaScript library because you are

00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,460
handling the translation in JavaScript

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:20,000
so I use that one Here I am

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,620
yes and the setup is like this this is a

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,630
file with the setup so basically it's

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,160
it's this magnet if localized it's

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,080
trying to find your best available

00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,919
language of your phone so I support

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,570
right now English and Spanish and if

00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:33,950
your phone is in different language it

00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,220
will go to the fallback which is English

00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:39,770
so you set up that staff and and you can

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:43,820
write instead of hard-coding strings you

00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:45,770
can just write it in this way and of

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,390
course so so if you have the the app

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,429
like that you want you change the phone

00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:52,340
language the app is supposed to change

00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:55,040
the language and there is like some

00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:58,100
problems here with Android it's it's

00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,530
faster than iOS but the way under it is

00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,480
set up in regnant if it doesn't kill the

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,610
app let's say so you need to take care

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,960
of a the angle the language saying you

00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,370
have some listener and change the

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,410
language so as you can see here in

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:12,020
Spanish in iOS it's going to take a

00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,860
while it's like doing some other

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,720
operations but

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,970
wanna kill the abbot when you open it

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,920
you're having in Spanish so just make

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,210
sure like if you translate the outlet

00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,340
when you change the language it's gonna

00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:25,540
be in in the correct one and as I said

00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:29,929
all the code is actually there for that

00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:33,080
so we have we have like okay I have like

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:35,809
two minutes it's good we have like we

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,910
open the app we see it how it looks how

00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,860
it works some little stuff so so this

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:42,290
app at the end of the day it achieved

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,410
the first goal I had which is being

00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:48,169
useful for me and useful for somebody

00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,790
else it's good so what about going to

00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:51,860
the App Store I was thinking should I

00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,690
talk he'll about I don't hope the

00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:57,110
permissions or the money you need to

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,910
spend the Apple Store but I thought it's

00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,419
not necessary because if you made if you

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:03,980
make a mistake here you can revert it so

00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:05,540
I thought about talking of the only

00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,460
mistake you cannot do when you go to the

00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,190
App Store which is this package name or

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,950
bundle ID so this package name is

00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:18,590
forever and I'm gonna show you three

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:20,419
package names so this is Facebook this

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,070
is what's up this is Instagram and why

00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:23,929
it's not con Facebook what's up calm

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,429
Facebook Instagram because it was not

00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,380
from Facebook at the beginning or they

00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:31,730
bought it so not even Facebook can

00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:36,140
change the package name so can you just

00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:38,450
be aware of it alright so what about

00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,790
open source you might think what why do

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,160
you talk about open source here and I

00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,929
was actually thinking - open source this

00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,820
app and the people are telling me that

00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:48,590
you're crazy maybe you want to put some

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,320
premium filters so you can make some

00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:53,929
money and so on but to be honest I'm

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,850
pretty sure that if you are playing with

00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:57,200
this app for a while any of you are

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:00,799
great developers and pretty sure you

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,630
could copy it it's not a problem and I

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,580
actually use ignite if it's open source

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:07,340
I use all these charts libraries I use

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,830
everything which is open source so I was

00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,840
thinking about the benefits and also I

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,980
have some experience in the market and I

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,360
know if somebody doesn't want to pay

00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,410
they will not pay they will just go

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:20,000
maybe to the black market there and I

00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,740
decided it might be better to open

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,080
source it because people could help me

00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,669
even that I would probably not accept an

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,830
issue that says why don't you migrate to

00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:28,890
typescript

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:33,760
[Music]

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:36,450
yeah okay so I open-source it you can

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:41,380
find all the code there

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:43,150
thank you you can find you can find all

00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,340
the gold there I know why I should have

00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:47,260
shown maybe a bit of more code but

00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,590
complicated with the time but everything

00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:53,040
is there I think it's it's nice to give

00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:55,600
back to all of you because to be honest

00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,760
if there was not for react native team

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,320
created react native the community who

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,809
maintains is all the library creators

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,940
this this will not exist so thank you

00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:07,150
everybody

00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:10,300
and another thing make sure if you built

00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:14,170
a nice app just pay to some designers

00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:16,660
and money to to make a nice icon because

00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,610
you go to the store and when the icons

00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,170
really stands out you even download it

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,480
for the icon mean if it looks but I

00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:25,809
don't download it so just make a nice

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,970
logo there and it's open source so just

00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:30,880
to wrap app I want to do some final

00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:32,830
remarks and I want to stress that for me

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,600
you know everybody here is react native

00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:39,400
ever probably want to be and we care

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,520
that this app is in reg native that it's

00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,290
nice when we are in Twitter we also are

00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,010
very proud to say I write this in react

00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:49,570
native but when you go to the real users

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,640
if they don't really know this is where

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:55,390
native in my opinion it kind of means

00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,429
that you're doing it well so I think

00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:04,690
that was everything that I wanted to

00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:08,230
focus on that aspect what I wanted to do

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:10,059
to also recommend you is this talk with

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:15,390
Chris Paul so it was here engine react

00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:15,390
in 2017 and it has a here hi

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,590
so there are a lot of concepts here even

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,260
more that I show that they still apply

00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:26,380
today so I would really recommend it it

00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:29,320
was an inspiration for for this talk so

00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,970
yeah now I did this happen to be honest

00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,040
when I started being developer I had

00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:34,420
this kind of strange dream that I will

00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,940
go to the public transport where

00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,620
everybody uses the phone and I would see

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,510
somebody using my app but I think now I

00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:44,250
will change that to see somebody in the

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:47,020
gym so this is from 2014 and if you

00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:51,490
change this for an airport this is still

00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:55,180
valid so yeah I invite you to check the

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:58,530
repository and to wrap up you know we as

00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:01,630
I said I work at caustic we are upstairs

00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:04,420
Mike Anna me you can go there if you

00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,070
have any questions I'll be happy to chat

00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,500
with you about it we also have this

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,300
react native view conference in Poland

00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,330
on September we have discounts there if

00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:15,070
you want to keep hearing nice talks

00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:18,360
about wearing it if I would invite you

00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:21,080
there so thank you very much

00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:28,369
[Applause]
