Description: 
	React Native CLI has been extracted out of the main repository a while ago, as a part of ongoing Lean Core effort. We have merged more than 100 PRs since then and the number is growing. We also shipped a ton of improvements with other exciting features on the roadmap. In this talk, I am going to give you an update where we are, what are the highlights from past few months and what you can expect from the future.
