Title: Transformation in the New Normal - TechHeads - July 2020
Publication date: 2020-08-04
Playlist: TechHeads
Description: 
	TechHeads is organised by Woodrow Mercer as a live webinar and presented on YouTube by Pusher.

Venkat Balakumar who has a strong profile as an interim CTO for healthcare start-ups, and he will be discussing: "Transformation in the new Normal".

In this presentation, we will look at the impact of the new normal after Covid-19 for the IT and steps to mitigate them. We will look at the effects from Data, System (Applications), Security & Audit, Knowledge Management and Budgeting viewpoints and understand how to overcome the impact with the help of various measures during and after the new normal. Here the new normal is the ability of an enterprise to conduct business as usual and facilitating the employee's to work from anywhere with minimal disruption. The transformation is the ability of a Business-IT to adapt and change quickly.

What its like to be a technology leader in a HealthTech environment, which couldn't come at a better time, considering the whole industry is under a real spotlight.

hi uh we'll take a look at uh

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,399
transformation

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:09,040
uh in new norm uh in this

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,080
uh presentation a little bit about

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,920
myself um

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,440
i am making dash balakumar i am an

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,839
experienced cto

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,600
i've been head of technology roles in

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,160
many organizations

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,359
um i'm also helping a lot of startups um

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,320
i've worked with a lot of financial

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
services

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,800
i'm an advocate of um cloud ai machine

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,599
learning

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,720
big data and devops i've created quite a

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,760
lot of

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:39,280
um strategies built teams

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,280
based on uh these uh technologies

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,040
let's take a look at uh what the new

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,600
normal

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,239
um is all about so i'm not going to

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,120
actually

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
bore you with uh what we have actually

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,000
encountered in the last

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,879
few months i actually wanted to discuss

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,399
about

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,600
what we are going to do now

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,199
and what is going to happen in the near

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,400
future

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,760
this is based on business id so the

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,760
business id and the strategy

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,240
that's the context so if you take a look

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,680
at what has happened in the last three

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,479
months which i want to quickly go

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,600
through and

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,200
this is not about the

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,520
work or i.t which we are doing this is

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,400
about some of the findings

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,920
which scientists did in the last three

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,960
or four months

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
that period which we encountered in our

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,439
life

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,360
probably once in a lifetime just

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,759
happened for most of us

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,240
hopefully let's keep it like that it

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,479
happens only once in a lifetime

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,880
this lockdown was the longest period of

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,799
quiet in the human history

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,360
we all might have actually encountered

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,479
that we all might have

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:57,119
felt it during this time

00:01:52,479 --> 00:02:00,799
less number of traffic quiet times

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,280
so this is one of the byproducts

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,880
um of the lockdown many of the uh many

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,240
scientists did a lot of research during

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,520
this lockdown period

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,399
uh which i'm not going gonna bore you

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,440
with um next comes

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,319
um facebook data which um i actually

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,440
found

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,920
in one of the um um zoom meetings which

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,480
i went recently uh with dxconnect

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,080
uh so facebook presented about uh what

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,200
has actually changed during the last

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,120
three months

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,319
um so one of the things which struck me

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,160
was uh this

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,400
point where they say like 94 percent of

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,400
the people who are using facebook

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,959
actually changed their daily habit

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
after kobe 19. this is like you know the

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,560
time we get up

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,200
the time we eat food the time we speak

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
with our

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,360
other peoples because facebook do have

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,480
data about our activities

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,400
through their app as well as whatsapp

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,160
and what kind of things which we discuss

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,879
with other people everything actually

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,280
changed the whole world actually

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,000
had gone through this change so these

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,200
are some of the

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,560
fun facts or facts about

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,720
the logged on period let's go into

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
uh the new normal let's define what's

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,440
the

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,800
new normal is the key performance

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,760
indicators or

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,480
of the new normal so we always want

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,000
business

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,599
as usual in any situation

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,920
that's what we're going to expect from

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,239
the new normal also

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,920
wherever we work from even though we are

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,040
a part you know we have we want to

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,799
actually work together

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,640
we want to use technologies

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,640
that actually keeps us together during

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,519
this time this

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,959
is actually the new normal which i'm

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,040
going to talk about

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,319
um in this presentation and

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,080
one thing which might we might have

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,760
noticed many of us might have actually

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,000
encountered is uh

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,280
um the dr and business continuity plans

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,920
which we have done

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,319
and tested in the last so many years

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,040
within

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,400
our organizations you know like um i've

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,680
seen um

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,040
long ago um we'll ask one of the network

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,959
uh person to go and sit

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,799
um in one of the routers near the

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,200
routers and then we'll

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,799
call them up and then we'll ask them to

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,519
pull the plug and then we'll just do the

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,320
test

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,880
um and then we'll also do the uh test by

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,040
asking people to work from home more

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,880
uh trying to find out whether our

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,400
network is capable of handling that so

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:32,479
those plans which we tested

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,520
before is now being done on real time

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,479
so these are the

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,479
kpis or these are the indicators which

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,759
we can

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,479
have in the new normal so

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,600
the main point here is business as usual

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,800
in any situation

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,840
that's what we are actually aiming to do

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,520
um during the last three months i had

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
the opportunity to speak with so many

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,280
people

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:04,479
and organizations meetings

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,479
from my home and i found out so many

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
outputs from those meetings and inputs

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
from the people

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,479
who attended the meetings so i created a

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,039
small swot analysis

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,280
on what i discussed what i heard what i

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,080
gathered as a data from them

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,440
looking at this analysis of the new

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,160
normal actually what

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,280
has happened what is happening now many

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,919
people say like

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,039
they are seeing better meetings compared

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,199
to what

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:37,039
um they used to be having before

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,160
um the the pandemic or kovi 19

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,000
so they're able to meet quickly

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,919
and then decide quickly on many aspects

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
within the organization so that's one of

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,400
the strengths which i which many people

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,759
actually said

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,800
uh is happening which i have also seen

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,440
personally

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,880
um a lot of collaborations more

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,919
collaborations increased

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,800
between um the people within the

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,000
organization

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:08,479
and within the vendors um and

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,840
other people who are giving support so

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,440
using various technologies uh not only

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,199
using uh chats not only using emails

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,759
but um personally what i use usually do

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,039
is like i keep a team

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,800
whatsapp group for all the teams

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,000
with whom i work with i still actually

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,080
maintain them and then keep in

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,319
connection with them

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,080
that helps us to quickly send a message

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,120
to them and then

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,319
do some work as and when needed uh so

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,840
wherever they are you know

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,199
if they're not able to pick up the

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,360
message immediately they'll be able to

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,720
pick it up when they go home or

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,600
uh when they actually see the um mobile

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,039
phone

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,160
um so that's how actually

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:58,080
this has happened more collaboration and

00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,039
more time people get more time now this

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,599
many say like no they um are spending

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
less

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,039
time in computing to their um

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,400
office and then they're spending more

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,400
productive time

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,240
uh in in giving

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,199
um the best of them during the work so

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,639
it's not like you know everybody um um

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,360
science has proven that everybody is not

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,000
able to work from nine to five or a

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560
defined

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,680
time everybody has their ups and downs

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
in a day

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,080
so this has given that flexibility for

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,720
many people to actually work

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,800
in times when they are actually up and

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,919
having more energy and more ideas and

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,039
more thoughts

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,240
so that's the strength

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:50,400
which i've seen during the new

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,639
normal and weaknesses

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,919
of course there is a new risk of working

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
from home

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,680
even i have experienced that actually i

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,280
started working

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,520
after putting something in the kitchen

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
in the in the hob and then i came

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,720
and started working i completely forgot

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,160
and then the whole thing

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,960
burnt completely so um luckily nothing

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,400
much happened

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,400
uh just the food burnt uh

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,560
that's the kind of risks which i'm

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,879
talking about while working from home

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,840
um of course there is a delicate balance

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,400
between

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,440
other um activities which we usually do

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,680
at home

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,960
and the work uh obviously you know that

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,199
um compensate

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,199
with the strength which i spoke before

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,080
about more time

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,039
and more flexibility on the way people

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,440
work

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,560
and next one i hear is completely

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
contrary to

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,959
uh the better meetings and better

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,240
decision making some people feel like

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:49,680
there is slowness or they have seen

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,560
slow decision making um rather than it

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,839
taking

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,160
um you know going to someone and then

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,200
asking

00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,399
um in their desk um

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,880
they it takes some time for them to um

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,560
keep in touch with them um and contact

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,680
them i mean they're working from home

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,959
and then

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,200
take the decision um based on

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,360
the inputs or outputs that's received

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
from that person

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,279
next one is an issue with onboarding

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,640
which we all might have actually seen

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,959
um when a new person is

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,880
on board into the organization during

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,320
this challenging time

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,200
um there are many issues like you know

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,480
um providing them with the welcome pack

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,600
um sending them

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,000
uh their laptops um to their home and

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,480
all

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,519
and letting them actually log into the

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,240
system

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
um for the first time and then introduce

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,040
introducing them

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,120
uh to the entire organization and the it

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,959
and the operations and everything so

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,200
that is a bit of a challenge

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,480
now probably it will be all right as we

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,160
actually go along

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,600
the new normal i'm going to actually

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,760
tell about that

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,760
um specifically on the knowledge

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,959
management and knowledge sharing which

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,920
needs much improvement during the new

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,959
normal

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,399
to um facilitate

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,600
such onboarding operations next comes

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,880
the opportunities

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,399
so opportunities are people

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,120
felt like they have had time

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,600
to stop and rationalize what they were

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,959
actually doing you know maybe a project

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,760
may be a program or investment in new

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,120
technology

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,399
or investment in um something which

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,600
um they wanted to um provide as a

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,959
service to others

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,880
so those things um

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,560
they actually had an opportunity to stop

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,079
for a couple of months

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,600
and then think about it and then

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,839
rationalize

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,120
so next one is tech rationalization

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,560
again you know

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,920
um this gave an opportunity

00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,560
for people to um

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,839
find out what actually works what

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,079
actually doesn't work

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,040
when people started to work from remote

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,399
and

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,839
they are able to identify these

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,040
systems which requires

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,800
improvement uh some systems which are

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,279
not even being used but still running

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
and

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,279
they can actually quickly uh shut it

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,440
down um

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,279
so these things which they found as an

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,720
opportunity during this lockdown

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,560
next comes learning which is very

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,120
interesting because people found a lot

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,480
of time actually to learn new things

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,640
during the lockdown um i've seen

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,800
many reports coming out from online

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,200
learning platforms like

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,120
people started buying more courses and

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,800
then started actually

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
uh going through the courses and i've

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,480
seen many people um

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
who um i spoke with some of my friends

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
actually who go on actually buying

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,160
courses during the

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,320
time and the course comes in 60 70

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,279
off in udemy and then they completely

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,399
forget that

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,000
and then again you know it keeps um

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,240
in in their inbox

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,279
uh without even knowing that they bought

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,639
that course

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,600
so uh they found time to learn

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,320
um and improve their skills maybe a soft

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
skill

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,240
or a hard skill um it skills whatever

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,800
you call it

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,720
so they find actually opportunity to um

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,160
stop and learn during this time

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,600
threats are a bit

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,760
harsh because um many roles actually

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,320
may go our minerals actually went away

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,320
during this

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,920
pandemic unfortunately so basically

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:45,040
um being positive hopefully everything

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,120
when the new normal is up and running

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,639
um roles will come back and then people

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,839
start to realize like

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,240
what they missed and then will be able

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,920
to

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,920
bring back people in to their

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,720
organization

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,880
new projects got delayed our new project

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,880
got completely shut down because of the

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:08,240
um new normal which we have already seen

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,560
um which resulted in a lot of

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,279
recruitments being stopped

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,680
and there's a huge cyber security threat

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,200
that has come up because of the new

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,560
normal when people started work from

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,399
home

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,920
people tend to access their

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,480
applications everything remotely um

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,000
which probably hosted on-premise or

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,480
hosted in the cloud

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,120
so there is quite a lot of opportunity

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,240
for

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,320
um cyber criminals to try and

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,199
um interface with people's

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,240
uh network and then try to steal data

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,560
out of it

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,839
so there's a huge cyber security threat

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,800
that is actually

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,800
come up recently so um there's quite a

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,360
lot of um

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,040
work that need to be done on that aspect

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,519
in this new normal

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,639
a lot of investment need to be made on

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,320
cyber security in the new normal

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,480
next one is of course office parties

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,279
many miss office parties i miss going

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,560
out with

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,600
my team uh of course i know um

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,760
when i provide

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,959
my service to an organization i usually

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,399
keep my team

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:25,360
close to my um heart and everybody

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,399
um we had a lot of things actually

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,800
happening around like

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,320
you know we used to have cook and bring

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,360
we share food

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,720
uh we go out um you know once in a

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,639
couple of weeks you know

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,880
and you know as part of the agile

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,920
process uh many teams

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,399
uh tend to go out um

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,399
during um their retrospective and then

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,800
do what their agility perspective

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,240
in during a lunch time out in the

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,279
restaurants that actually

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,320
got completely stopped now and

00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,320
hopefully in the new normal

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,320
we'll come back to

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,800
meeting people uh very soon

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,040
so let's see about

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,959
transformation now so we spoke about

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,560
transformation in new normal we define

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,920
what new normal is we're going to define

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,720
what transformation is

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,600
it's a bit simple transformation is just

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,279
change

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,240
so change if you look at in any way it's

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,680
something really

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
huge a change in organization changing

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,720
the way

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
people were changing the people mindset

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,480
how they actually

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,680
um used to work before everything is

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,959
changed now

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,000
so it's nothing but change

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,839
in people as well as business id i

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,040
was specifically given like not business

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,800
and i t because

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,920
nowadays and of course in the future

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,800
business id is same

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,639
it's the same unit in an organization if

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,199
something happens to business it affects

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,040
the idea

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
if something happens in 90 it affects

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,639
the business

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,759
so they actually go together they are

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,440
not

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:09,040
um two different entities now

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,560
so let's define the new normals on

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,320
the business id what is actually going

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,600
to happen um

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,560
look at the id side of that venn diagram

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,199
if you take

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,920
business and as one side and ideas

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,240
another side

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,440
intersecting with each other i'm going

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,480
to actually speak about

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,959
the i.t side of it uh now um

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,320
so we'll take these topics um and then

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,199
i'll quickly go through the

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,240
new normal on data system operations

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,079
security audit

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,079
knowledge sharing an id budget

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,160
now let's look at the data so what we

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,240
expect in the new normal

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
on data so we expect data to be

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,160
accessible from

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,639
anywhere securely so that's the thing

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,160
which

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:55,839
we want and also data should be easy

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:59,440
to find that is categorized curated

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:03,600
behind certain apis securely

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,760
um make sure like you know the data is

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,199
reliable because of the curation that

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,360
has happened

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:14,160
and also anonymized and classified

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,679
we can't actually let open the data uh

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,760
to everyone and also

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,280
in an organization which is spread

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,360
around the world

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,280
obviously you know you cannot export

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,439
data from one location to another

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,120
location without anonymizing

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,440
or classifying the data so next one

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,280
um comes the centralized part of the

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,200
data so specifically within the legal

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,039
boundaries uh we have to

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,440
make sure it is in a central location

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,640
where people will be able to

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,880
uh access it from anywhere and

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,240
it should be available all the time so

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,520
that's the

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,080
data side of the new normal next comes

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,960
the

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,200
system side uh which is your it

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,240
applications uh your

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,919
pass the vendor applications

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,320
everything which we access as part of

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,720
our business as usual

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,600
and day-to-day activity so these should

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,799
be secure

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,440
and accessible from anywhere so you must

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,480
have

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,799
less downtime compared to

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,400
what you have before because if

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,280
something goes down actually that's it

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,760
like you know

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,000
whole cycle of productivity gets um

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,000
completely affected this will have more

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,320
effect in the new normal compared to

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,320
what you what we had in the office

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,000
because if something happened when we

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,880
were all in the same location in an

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,360
office

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,360
um we'll have the ability to quickly

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,799
call up the person who's responsible for

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,320
a particular application or the team

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,039
who's responsible for that

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,360
and then make them to fix it quickly and

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,000
then

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,280
things start to move quickly but in this

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,799
time

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,840
we must make sure we build the system

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,480
with the

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,000
key requirement that it has to go

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,760
through less downtime it has to be

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,320
resilient actually

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,600
and the system should also be repairable

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,880
and replaceable

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,000
easily um i don't want to actually

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,520
give away more on the technical side on

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
what to do with this i'll come to that

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,200
later on the takeaway part of

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:20,960
this uh presentation and

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,520
next comes easy to develop so basically

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,720
you know um we used to have teams

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,240
sitting in the office

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,520
trying to develop these uh projects

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,559
uh and you know we all were together in

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,679
the same place

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,720
but in this new normal we should

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,840
be in a situation where the products are

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,400
the projects which we are actually

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,960
working on or easy to develop

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,880
from anywhere in the world anywhere

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,400
which we are where we are sitting

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,320
of course anywhere in the world actually

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,880
races and under

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,840
uh opens another box pandora box of

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,679
outsourcing

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,039
which i don't want to get into it and

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,440
now uh

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,720
that's completely different way of uh

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,240
managing

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:08,240
compared to uh in-house development

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:11,840
or purchasing something from a vendor

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,559
so next comes the

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,320
agility in the way which we develop

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,159
system we want to have a jail way of

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,600
delivering the systems

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,640
and of course i want to put a point on

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,480
cloud native

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,280
uh in this system's

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,240
new normal because cloud native make

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,480
sure

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,559
everything is put in the cloud nothing

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,600
is dependent on anything on-premise

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:41,280
and we'll be able to rely on

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,520
the cloud cloud native features

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,559
and we'll be able to develop the systems

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,280
from anywhere

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,080
in the world or anywhere um from from

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,840
our home or

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,880
different offices and

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,520
that's that's how actually uh i expect

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,039
uh the new normal to happen now and on

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,840
and on

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,840
the coming um months and years

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,559
and next comes the new normal of

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,039
security and audit

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,559
so cyber security as i discussed before

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,880
in the swat analysis

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,080
is the key now it's something which need

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,080
to be

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,840
immediately looked at and immediately

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,919
implemented within the organization

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,280
audited within the organization

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,520
and we don't want um

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,720
to end up like any organization which

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,400
went through

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,280
um you know ransomwares

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,480
in the recent past so cyber security is

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,280
the key

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,880
new normal which need to be immediately

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,559
addressed

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,080
next comes the privacy engineering that

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:51,120
privacy engineering concept is

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,840
completely um a large concept on its own

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,520
um i just want to quickly um give you a

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,000
give an idea of what privacy engineering

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,600
is

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,480
privacy engineering is something if you

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,919
have a huge amount of data or a data set

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,600
with you and if it contains any

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:11,280
privacy data or privacy

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,320
fields in the data privacy engineering

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,039
make sure

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,400
that gets anonymized that guest gets

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,440
masked

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,640
before you start consuming the data so

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:26,240
this is a new um id

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,080
um trend righty um

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,159
strategy that's coming up which is being

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,440
used by many organizations now which are

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,600
using big data

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,440
privacy engineering so next comes

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,840
identity and access management

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,120
which is of course you know comes under

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,400
the security

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,120
or cyber security also so

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,280
basically you know we many tend to

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,559
utilize identity and access management

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,919
which are on premise and those need to

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,679
be moved

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,960
into cloud and a new way of

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:02,240
managing your devices

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,440
your applications and access managements

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,440
need to be defined in a new normal next

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,039
one is activity audit so

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,039
basically everything need to be audited

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,159
and you will be in

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,640
now from now on in the new normal you'll

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,159
end up

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,880
with a huge amount of activity data

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,640
that need to be preserved in case

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,400
something happens

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,000
which is um against an organization's or

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,679
enterprise policy

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,120
so we'll be able to go back into the

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,679
audit and we'll be able to find out what

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,559
just what

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,600
actually happened so i expect a lot of

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,640
activity audit

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,760
or audit to happen during this new

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,000
normal

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,000
time

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,320
so next comes a new normal of operations

00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,520
[Music]

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,240
this actually brings in new

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,440
practices like agile if you are not

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,799
using agile

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,919
devops sre a lot of new practices need

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,200
to be

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,600
incorporated into an organization um and

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,559
should be a part of the uh it strategy

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,480
actually

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:13,120
uh so that's um the

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,520
the new normal um of operations you know

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,320
this

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,120
definitely facilitates some systems

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,720
development

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,559
in a huge uh way because um

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,159
incorporating agile and devops uh

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,440
definitely you know increases the

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,480
productivity of

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,919
the development teams uh systems which

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,440
we develop

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,919
and deliver everything uh faster

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,480
and better than it used to be for next

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,799
comes

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,000
cloud native that also comes under the

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,120
operations

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,720
where everything is um you know um i'm

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,520
trying to actually define it in

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,679
um very neutral non-technical way so

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,360
cloud native is something where you

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,200
everything runs from the cloud

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,840
everything so

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,640
operations should also be taking into

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,600
account

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,760
uh the cloud native aspects and should

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,120
be managing the cognitive aspects

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,760
in the new normal next comes the it

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,320
budgeting

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,600
so a lot of capex will now move into

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,279
opex

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,720
now for example you know on-premise to

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,039
cloud and

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,799
newer increased uh in collaboration

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,240
tools and softwares

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,760
now a lot of new license need to be

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,039
bought because many people started to

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,240
work from home

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,640
uh probably like we'll have uh to

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,320
improvise on the way we collaborate

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,520
probably invest on some chat

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,080
tools and softwares we may need to

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,000
actually

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,120
encounter new vendors and we need to

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,880
bring them in

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,799
uh for facilitating the new normal

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,080
so that's also going to happen that's

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,480
also has

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:49,279
a significant investment to be done

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,799
and of course investment in cyber

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,760
security is one of the major things

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,840
which um

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,480
i advocate uh during the new normal

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,919
so let's take a look at the takeaways

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,279
what we have discussed now i'm going to

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,400
actually summarize that

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,279
so data availability and data management

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,080
are the key during a new normal you know

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,760
anyone can

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,279
hold any amount of data nowadays

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,480
actually you can have a huge

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:17,840
amount of data you're lying in your

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:21,279
servers or on the cloud um

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,480
a lot of data sets but you

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,960
should know where your data is

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,080
and what the data actually means to you

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,360
which means like you know

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,159
you can have data catalogs um you'll be

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,720
able to

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,679
have data links actually api is in front

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,039
of those

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,799
and data to access the data securely

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:44,640
and so the the crux here is no data in

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,440
your finger picking fingerprint who

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,080
has data in their fingerprint is that is

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,760
the king

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,480
so we have seen in the recent

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,400
announcement from the oxford um

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,159
vaccine trial they said like no they

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,880
have done the work which is supposed to

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,000
be

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,919
done in five years

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,120
in six months time so this i believe

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,880
is possible because of

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:14,000
the big data and the data management

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,480
and data availability with the research

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,960
team

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,279
which researched on kovit 19.

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,399
next is survivable depends on how quick

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,840
we are output the change

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:27,520
so this is not an option now uh we had

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,679
to actually do these changes within the

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,200
organization bring in these changes

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:36,640
how responsive id you know

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,360
than being reactive to these changes um

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,279
so not only actually to the changes of

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,559
because of new normal but also

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,000
the business changes that um

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:51,840
is the result of the new normal

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,279
next systems should be responsive

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,600
quickly replaceable and repairable um

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,200
either in parts or whole so there are so

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,840
many other id strategies

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,120
rit technologies actually we need to uh

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,120
bring it into the organization

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,799
if we are not doing it before like

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,240
microservices apis

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:13,360
uh messaging cloud native sas pass

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,559
so this actually will help us

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,640
to be responsive and make sure like

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,760
the systems are quickly repairable and

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,240
replaceable

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,200
next is the knowledge sharing this is

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,240
the most

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,440
important part of the

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,640
um new normal which

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,159
we'll be uh doing we should be doing

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,159
so knowledge sharing or knowledge

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,679
management um

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,919
should be nurtured within the

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,159
organization and

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,360
more investment need to be done on this

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,720
aspect because

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,960
everybody is working from different

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,480
locations and everybody is actually

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,640
uh doing work a different time and

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,640
when with knowledge being at a

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,480
centralized location

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,760
and managed properly will have

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,399
a same language spoken between

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,360
on different teams within the

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,720
organization

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,039
and same understanding and knowledge

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,000
being obtained or exchanged between

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,760
teams

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,520
so this is one of the important

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,960
takeaways

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,520
on the new normal um next one is you

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,159
know

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,200
stronger i.t roadmap and strategy that

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,600
need to be done

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,799
based on these takeaways for the next

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,760
six months

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,399
to probably know three year time um i

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,799
would say like

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,240
starts with six months and then we'll go

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,360
ahead and then

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,760
create one uh one

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,080
for the longer duration so something

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,120
need to be done for the next six months

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,919
and strong i.t roadmap and strategy need

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,440
to be

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,399
deviced for the new normal

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,600
um another thing is investing in the

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,840
future

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,880
um of course definitely on cyber

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,840
security

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,919
you know and data science um machine

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,440
learning and artificial intelligence

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,159
um are the future so more investment

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,600
need to be done

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,000
on these sides um you may ask like what

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,320
is

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,039
the takeaway on this for the new normal

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,240
uh you know

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,640
having data science or machine learning

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,240
um there are many use cases which i can

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,120
actually cite probably i don't have time

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,640
now

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,720
we can discuss it later if somebody

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,440
wants uh do actually

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,640
um let me know i'll be happy to actually

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,240
discuss on

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,279
um those topics

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,919
um of course you know change management

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,600
uh has to happen um you have to have a

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,679
really strict instringent

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,640
and definite change management that need

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,760
to be

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,600
uh happening during this new normal

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,679
now specifically on eliminating fears

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,360
and acceptance of the new normal

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:58,640
um i have a big advocate of um

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,000
mental health uh for people so

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,559
uh you know i do not actually want to

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,840
manage only the i.t but also you know

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,080
i want to manage people's

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,960
mental health and support their mental

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,399
health

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,360
in during my um

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,120
service in any organization so those

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,919
things need to be taken care

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,200
you know even more rigorously in this

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,840
new normal

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,880
um of course culturally evaluation you

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,000
know the way we

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,519
used to use used to work before we got

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,440
used to

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,519
um doing certain things that has

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,399
completely changed now so

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,320
um new people you know we have to

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,840
unlearn a lot of things actually

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,000
and we have to actually be transparent

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,000
otherwise things are not going to work

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,039
when people are working from a part

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,640
and lot of changes can happen in the

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,840
software development lifecycle

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,960
in your i.t organization

00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,320
realigning your

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,159
business strategies um or its id

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,200
strategies uh to the business and the

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,399
other way around

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,480
so so many um re-evaluation need to be

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,960
happening during this time

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,240
next one is innovate so that's what i

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,840
would um

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,279
um recommend as a last point here and an

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,720
important point so which

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,600
i always nurture in my

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,720
work is innovation so things like you

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,399
know gamification

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,480
hackathons you know knowledge sharing

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,120
the new ways of knowledge sharing

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,760
so these things need to be there as part

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,640
of the

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,600
new normal within an organization so

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,279
probably like

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,000
um i believe i've not touched

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,480
a lot of deep itn technology side and

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,760
then try to keep myself

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,799
to more generic terminologies so

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:56,720
hopefully everyone actually enjoyed

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,960
this presentation thank you very much

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,559
for giving this opportunity to speak

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,960
with you all

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,960
