Description: 
	TechHeads is organised by Woodrow Mercer as a live webinar and presented on YouTube by Pusher.

Venkat Balakumar who has a strong profile as an interim CTO for healthcare start-ups, and he will be discussing: "Transformation in the new Normal".

In this presentation, we will look at the impact of the new normal after Covid-19 for the IT and steps to mitigate them. We will look at the effects from Data, System (Applications), Security & Audit, Knowledge Management and Budgeting viewpoints and understand how to overcome the impact with the help of various measures during and after the new normal. Here the new normal is the ability of an enterprise to conduct business as usual and facilitating the employee's to work from anywhere with minimal disruption. The transformation is the ability of a Business-IT to adapt and change quickly.

What its like to be a technology leader in a HealthTech environment, which couldn't come at a better time, considering the whole industry is under a real spotlight.
