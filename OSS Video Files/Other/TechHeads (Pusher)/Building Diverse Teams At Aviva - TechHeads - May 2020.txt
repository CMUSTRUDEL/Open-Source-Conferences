and so this is a little bit about what

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,849
I've done and why I've done it so one of

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,429
the reasons I'm here and I'm doing what

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:14,040
I do is because there's stuff like this

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,890
basically on social media and this is a

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,680
really common reaction to something that

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,310
I would post or you know if someone

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:28,560
would ask for advice there's a general

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,570
flat-out knee-jerk reaction that if

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,980
women needed to be in tech or women

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,739
we're going to be in tact we'd be there

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,540
already why do we need a special program

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,950
why do we need to do anything like that

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,960
it's it's quite entrenched in the

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,180
existing tech community which can be

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,510
something that can merely hamper your

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,520
recruitment efforts because I have found

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,260
in the past is if you've got a lot of

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,750
attitude like this within the company

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,820
already there won't be support for your

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:02,370
work other than on paper and once and if

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,450
you do get any diverse teams in this

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,369
sort of entrenched attitude is really

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,180
obvious straightaway so people won't to

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,040
stay now these are all genuine what I've

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,680
done every time I see someone posting

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,540
this is I screenshot it like I've shown

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,369
you here and I look and if they're

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,799
stupid enough to post where they work on

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,869
their social media I send it to their

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,460
company today I bet you're having a

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,610
problem having diverse tech teams aren't

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,350
you so these are as I've said actual

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,659
screenshots from things that I've posted

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:40,890
online and when I get them oh yeah I

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,840
don't get into a flame war online I just

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,060
send them to the HR of the company here

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,860
they work for if they've put it here

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,250
they work for online because these are

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,310
the type of people who will be hampering

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,880
their company's approach to home in

00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:01,110
diverse settings and people who see me

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,119
and no need for diversity believing that

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,369
women are paid more or they get the jobs

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,890
because they're better looking or these

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,899
are all you know I made these are really

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,849
easy to find anything like this if you

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,430
go into any kind of social media and

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:22,349
tech groups there are there

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:25,470
and they are part of the problem so now

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,879
can I get it to advance yeah so

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,500
hopefully you can see the next slide now

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,569
it's really informative it's just one of

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,220
my favorite things I mean big unicorns

00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,930
and because that's what I've built is

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,090
the Unicorn it is the tech myth that you

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,519
can't have 50/50 teams you can't have

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:45,200
diverse teams doesn't exist you can't do

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:49,889
it well that's not correct you can do it

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,019
and the way you do it is by having

00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:55,560
people who are passionate about doing it

00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,769
by you know setting your goals but also

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,379
being realistic about them and we're

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:06,389
going to goals in a little bit but the

00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:08,579
reality is it's hard it's really hard

00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,590
it's really hard to do is if it was easy

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:13,439
everyone would be doing it I've got some

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,319
stats comparing where I was at against

00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,359
the other big tech companies and you

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,120
know if Microsoft and Google still

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,680
haven't got 50/50

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,690
you know they know and they've got

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:30,139
programs you know I've worked with with

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:32,970
Microsoft doing digital stuff I've done

00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:34,829
Google's I'm remarkable gone dance there

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,069
lovely office in Kings Cross

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,659
they've all got initiatives and they are

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:43,349
needed and they are working but there's

00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,909
still more to do and maybe if I was in a

00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:50,010
company the size I can only talk about

00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:51,510
my area my scrum teams in my Aviva but I

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,489
mean it's not just a small so it's not

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,379
just one scrum team it's it's multiple

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,989
so I'll come on to the size and the

00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:01,819
types of roles and things later but yeah

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,819
the Unicorn is real it can be done

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:08,250
something about what I do so people will

00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,919
say ah what do you do Nina I'm an IT

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,680
manager what's that mean so I'm like

00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,229
okay so when when you log in to any of

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,389
your apps on your phone or your banking

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:19,590
or any of that you'll get a little donut

00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,599
going around around around around around

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,940
around around and you can't see what

00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:25,740
it's doing that's all mine all my

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,219
stuff's in this invisible it's in the

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,219
donut

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,449
I don't get a lot of front end designers

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:36,210
I don't have anything pretty to show

00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,860
people about what I do so he talked to

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,800
them about the donor and being in the

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,889
donor and if they actually are more

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
interested or go on to talk about

00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:47,069
plumbing

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,240
because it's the best analogy I have for

00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:53,069
middleware so you've got a nice front

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,440
end you've got a beautiful glass sink

00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:58,949
with one of those flat tray waterfall

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,659
taps some lovely UX design own and UI

00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:01,919
people have put that together and

00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:03,780
they've worked out where the best

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,599
buttons are what the proper colors are

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,449
and then at the back end you've got a

00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:12,630
mainframe that's 30 years old 40 years

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,889
old maybe even older you know I'm I'm

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,780
getting on for that so you know

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,430
realistically some of the pension

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,139
systems I'm working on actually almost

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:24,090
are older than me because pensions are

00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,250
one thing that doesn't upgrade every

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,349
year and you've got a pension when

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,870
you're 20 and you might be drawing on it

00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:32,870
when you're 65 and that's 45 years later

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,409
so they have very long running systems

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,789
so to me my back-end pension systems at

00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,320
40 odd years old they're the water

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:42,870
treatment so it's they say you

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,990
reservoirs there you big back-end data

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,659
lakes water lakes think fit the same

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,259
thing your front end nice shiny stuff is

00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:53,789
you sink everything in the middle

00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:57,150
whether it's the plumbing in your house

00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:59,219
or the sewerage in your street but it's

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,759
middleware that is API so that's what I

00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:05,270
do it's not pretty and you don't want to

00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,469
know about it until it goes wrong

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,479
because if it goes wrong and you get

00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:12,569
sewage sprouting out of your sink then

00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:16,469
you're very upset very quickly so it's

00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:18,960
it's important to not know about it it's

00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:21,270
basically if anyone's coming to you with

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,750
a middleware problem then it's pretty

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,690
much pure and that's what you don't want

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:31,550
so there is a slight twist in this that

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:34,139
the gender diversity in middleware is

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:37,650
actually much lower than any other area

00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:42,270
in tech because it isn't somewhere

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:45,230
that's an attractive area to work

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:49,320
a lot of the women in tech will go into

00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:51,360
from end rolls p.m. rolls ba roles that

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,180
aren't necessarily pure technical roles

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,760
in middleware all of the roles even the

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,720
BAS our technical RBA's will need to

00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,220
know a lot about data mapping and

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,070
interfaces to actually work on this so

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,410
everything in my area is technical and

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:11,940
that there are no non-technical tech

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:15,150
roles as it were so when I came in

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,440
Sheffield I set myself goals Aviva has

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,090
this great thing you'll get some

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,860
cascaded down I'm sure many companies

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,690
are the same you'll get a mid-year and

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,990
end of year there's sort normal sort of

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:28,500
stuff but there's always that will set

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,590
yourself some goals so these were the

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,660
goals I set myself so one was about the

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:37,020
number of people one was about the

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,300
diversity of people and one was about

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,740
the quality of people because it's no

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:46,200
good just hiring a load of really

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:48,630
rubbish people so these weren't

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,370
something that I was asked to do but if

00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,810
I was going to build a new team from

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:57,360
scratch I had the opportunity to not

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,160
employ people who would post stuff on

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,540
social media like we've we saw at the

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:07,200
beginning and I had the opportunity to

00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,270
build a balanced team so these these are

00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,860
the one I sent myself these the ones

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:16,050
that I achieved didn't achieve all of

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:20,640
them deficit arts good and so I didn't

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:23,310
get my scrum team for in first year just

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,800
sheer volume I was recruiting an

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,050
interview in just did not get there

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,440
didn't get all mine didn't get my

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,460
stretch

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,900
target at 42 and didn't get the second

00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:40,410
scrum team for pensions up it it was

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:43,890
just sheer volume of recruitment over a

00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:48,980
year and draining the market of quality

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:51,000
and other things quality wise and I

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,070
didn't do a fail fast

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,340
I managed somebody out but that took

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,780
nine months

00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:00,790
a lot slower than anticipated then it

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:05,140
can be a lot of reasons for that but you

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:09,450
know also I didn't have any voluntary

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,450
levers before year ends but I did have

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,350
because it was a fail fast and it didn't

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,850
play off a story I considered it because

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,510
I managed someone out and it took nine

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,280
months I failed that on quality but and

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,740
in the second year had a similar thing

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,500
but I think it's good to have that as a

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:31,720
target and to try and manage fast now

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:34,780
some people and some companies have this

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,460
of probation period that wasn't

00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,330
something that I had as a formal thing

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:43,180
in Aviva set for me as by the company

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:45,280
and by not having that it gave people a

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,890
lot of confidence to grow especially the

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:52,120
more junior team members if I'd have had

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:54,370
it would I have met that maybe but

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,970
sometimes when you're in a new very

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,860
technical area I think maybe three

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,750
months was was ambitious in the first

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,820
place yeah I did set the goals I set

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:09,220
them they weren't said to me and there

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:14,830
was something that I believed in so this

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:17,560
was the year and that we were at 2018

00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:21,430
and then I've got the 2019 sample

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:25,060
further on so it's a little bit small to

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:27,610
read some of this but I don't know how

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,740
to move some of my my time even your

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:37,990
faces around my screen so the tech job

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,520
ratios is amazing because like I say the

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,620
majority of our tech but what I did is

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,770
excluded scrum masters from that and

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:49,950
excluded bas so if you look at the tech

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:55,030
job split I've got 30 percent of female

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:56,980
didn't mean to do that and detect job

00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:02,470
split I've got thirty percent of females

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:04,880
on there and that is way above most

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,610
people's tech jobs split

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,880
and this was in the first year wasn't by

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,769
the second year which I've got later

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:17,360
Mike Misty split wasn't great on the

00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:19,810
first year it was representative - Aviva

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,540
but it wasn't representative to

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:27,110
Sheffield so some work on that came in

00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,630
the second year and the overall

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,680
workforce again was still a little bit

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:36,680
unbalanced at the end of the first year

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:40,370
so yeah there's a little bit of there in

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:44,329
terms of women in development the

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:47,300
overall industry figures are 14% but

00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:49,490
then Stack Overflow so it said around 7%

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,089
well if I come on to my developers in a

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,759
bit that's you know I am on the 50-50

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:59,810
there so it it's possible but we'll talk

00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:02,060
about how I did that so on to my next

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,339
screen so this is about developers and

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:13,160
developers are who I enjoy managing the

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:15,740
most so in 1992 94 I did GCSE a level

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,130
and a level computer science

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:21,680
these were my best mates they are the

00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,360
majority of people currently and still

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,220
working in the tech industry now they

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,300
are your white middle-aged men that are

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,380
your experts and to be fair I'm not

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,959
going to say that any of them are going

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:36,920
to write stuff like I found one line but

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:40,329
that is always been the image that has

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,880
always been the image it isn't true and

00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:46,009
it's about me and abling people to make

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:51,079
it not true so these are some of my

00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:55,160
girls from Aviva from 2018 International

00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:57,139
Women's Day they're all coders bar the

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:02,930
lady with blonde hair - left to me who's

00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:04,970
a BA and she is a technical BA they have

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:09,079
all come to work for me I've chosen to

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:12,019
it for me for varying reasons but they

00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:13,850
are technical women and they want to

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:15,470
support other technical women so they're

00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,649
keen on getting involved in women's day

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,930
they're keen on doing mentoring 13

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:24,379
you know public speaking and coming out

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:27,170
and helping me carry the message there

00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:29,629
isn't a range of diversity there in

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:35,089
terms of age as well and in terms of

00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:37,790
ethnicity so so by the end of I think

00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:43,759
the cut from October 2019

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:45,769
this was my scrum teams so a couple of

00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:50,740
scrum teams in that I've got domain

00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:53,119
owners tech needs both my bas at women

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,579
but you can actually see in terms of

00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:59,350
developers I've got more female

00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:04,100
developers than I have male

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:06,050
so that is but also my teacher leads

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,019
blessum in the middle in red there

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:11,059
they're both men because to be a tech

00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:14,540
leads we've been around in this industry

00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:16,220
a long time you've you're still looking

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,649
at middle-aged white men and they have

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,149
their place and they are amazing and I

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,759
love them to bits my tech needs they're

00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:25,579
fantastic but it's about getting the

00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,259
right at once so designers which I don't

00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:29,029
mean front end designers not pretty

00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:31,009
technical designers that look at the

00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:35,929
data flow and data mapping they're both

00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:38,209
women and one of them is is Indian so

00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:39,920
you see it's been quite difficult for me

00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:41,480
to map people's ethnicity and these

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,069
little emojis because I'm always going

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,990
to use people's photos and it really

00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:47,360
blew all their anonymity so I asked the

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,740
girls if I could choose their photos for

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,319
their women today but other than that

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,120
I've tried to stick with emojis not

00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:57,920
everyone in my team loves their emoji

00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:01,670
face but this is my team but you can see

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,279
from that that tech needs I've got a

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,809
couple of mid to senior level women

00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,610
they're coming through that will be tech

00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:10,069
needs within a couple years they're not

00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,019
quite there yet so it's about getting

00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:15,199
the right leads to create the right

00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:20,929
environment for them just commenting but

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:23,929
yeah more more female than male so

00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:27,379
another way to look at it was the age

00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:30,049
diversity so putting those emojis you

00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:31,100
see your nice middle-aged white man

00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:33,950
layer in the middle

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,380
and then at the bottom we've got a nice

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,720
diverse young team that are going to be

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,140
the future well this is how sorts of

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,670
future ever be with a future the forge

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,290
we've also got some older ladies and

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,760
some of these older ladies at the top

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:54,380
and I've actually be trained into tech

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:56,420
and they have been a real asset into the

00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,250
into the forge accepting a lot of

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,550
maturity some of them bringing business

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,110
experience in and just a different life

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,200
perspective and that is how the

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:09,110
diversity in teams works is bringing

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,540
that differences of background in

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:15,170
whether it is your age or your ethnicity

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:18,020
whatever it is it's valuable so one of

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:23,240
the things that I've done is these are

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:24,770
often my values now every time you go to

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,400
a new company they'll have some company

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:31,100
values and a lot of them will be around

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:37,070
trust and diversity may be around

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:38,480
networking connected things like that so

00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,990
one of the things that I find is really

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,330
really important is trust and building

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,420
your team's trust in you and even when

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,740
they're come in for an interview

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,340
particularly if I'm speaking from

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,510
Sheffield the market is blooming

00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,900
developers out there can walk out of one

00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:59,360
job and into another is that simple so

00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,730
how are you gonna retain them how are

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,080
you going to convince since join you so

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,390
you've got to put that across in the

00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,700
interview so I interviewed all the staff

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,890
that worked for me I didn't do all their

00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,890
tech tests so I didn't do every in-depth

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,680
piece of checking on on the background

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,600
but I did interview them so that they

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:22,490
could understand what I was building and

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,860
why I'm a big fan of coaching coaching

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,630
approach to develop a younger team which

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,590
is what I got you know the big base of

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,870
the pyramid we see youth and coaching

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,420
them and bringing them on and asking

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,880
them what they want which comes to

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:41,420
feedback which is a really common theme

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,940
in in my team building and establishing

00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,780
so without the trust you can't build

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,080
that the feed

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,940
that every time I joined people in

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,260
cohorts two or three people a months and

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,940
no one joined on their own no one's

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,500
first day was on their own that was

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,650
really important because people's first

00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:01,130
days really make them feel welcome or

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:03,290
not so joining people in cohorts every

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:07,670
month or every other month in groups of

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:09,610
two or three worked we did lots of team

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,780
building games on people's first days

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:15,320
one of the team-building games that I

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:18,920
use that I've used before is one about

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,540
music and bands so rolling a circle in

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:25,340
the breakout area with the beanbags and

00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:28,520
a coffee and relaxing and you say name

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:31,100
him a band and it goes round and say if

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,920
I say ac/dc the person next to me has to

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,700
start theirs with a C so they'll say

00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,340
Cliff Richard

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,220
it ends with a D the next person has to

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,010
start with a D and and so on and so

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,790
forth this worked pretty well I thought

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,460
but afterwards I spoke to the new two of

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,900
the new recruits the following day like

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,910
how was your first day what could we

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:57,620
have done better and they said well I

00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,990
didn't really know any of the music now

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:03,170
those two it was before lady and a

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:06,860
gentleman who had African origins their

00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:09,170
music that they were brought up on was

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,090
totally different they didn't you know

00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:14,570
ac/dc might be something that's really

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:16,100
well known to the white population but

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,080
if you've been brought up in Africa and

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,950
I've only come to the UK in your late

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,490
teens early twenties to study it's not

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:28,040
necessarily going to be relevant for you

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:31,340
so finding that feedback and allowing

00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,740
them to say to me actually it was a bit

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,260
of a white game you know I've never used

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,840
it since but you've got to have give

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,550
people the opportunities to say what

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,520
makes them feel included what doesn't

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:46,010
make them feel included as a result of

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,020
that I asked them is there anything that

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:51,800
you would like to do we already do

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:55,010
Ramadan and Eid you know big food then

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,260
and Diwali any any excuse for a

00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,830
celebration Valentine's bakes whatever

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,320
we were

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:04,340
all over it so we did them the first

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,950
ever Nigeria day that a viewer had ever

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,919
seen and we had you know a little bit of

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:12,500
a budget for bringing in certain rice

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,720
dishes and we all had this fizzy drink

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,640
that was totally different and these two

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,309
people you know that was their heritage

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,230
that's what they understood and so we

00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:23,120
brought that to the rest of the team and

00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:26,299
and spoke about that

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,010
so getting the feedback early on and

00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,820
developing that trust so that people can

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:33,289
say stuff like that is so important

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,710
people talk about diversity but are they

00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:39,559
proactively seeking a more engaged team

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:44,960
and by practically seeking an engaged

00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:48,019
team I mean working with areas outside

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,240
of the universities yep I did the

00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:52,360
universities used to go to the careers

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,730
first they were my little Aviva stall I

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:59,149
didn't actually take on anyone from any

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,789
of those days and that didn't happen

00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:06,649
they weren't the right candidates when I

00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:11,529
did interview them how did I recruit the

00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:16,639
diverse team I used separate companies

00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:21,340
that are looking to do diversity as part

00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:24,590
of their primary focus so you've got

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:28,360
innovator in Liverpool you've got North

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:30,620
coders in month in month for Manchester

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:35,059
and you've got been a sir and the

00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:38,450
developer Academy in Sheffield these are

00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:41,210
companies that are driven by individual

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:45,889
si but Chelsea Slater in invite her Amal

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:48,620
Basara that been a sir these are people

00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:51,169
that are like me that want to do

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,630
something about the diversity in tech so

00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:56,090
our offering training directly to

00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:58,639
diverse candidates at reduced rates at

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:01,730
free rates at sponsored rates all these

00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:03,889
different options that they provide so

00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,690
what proactively seeking a team is

00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,760
you've got to develop the relationships

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,549
with the people in your area that are

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,660
doing this stuff there's you can't put

00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:14,600
an advert out

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,040
like the very unique lick that I put

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,570
right on at the beginning from Facebook

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,660
well the adverts are out there women can

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,540
apply if they want to they won't if you

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:26,270
put an advert out women won't apply

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:29,690
that's not how you get a diverse team

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:31,670
you've got to be proactive and you've

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:36,650
got to be looking at feedback so if

00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:38,930
somebody isn't applying the best that

00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,760
there are quite a few networks for women

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,800
coders there's one called ADA's List

00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,920
which actually a lot more true as I

00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:51,110
speak to have never heard of ADA's list

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:54,380
is a separate network that is just about

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:56,120
recruiting women for tech jobs and these

00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,520
jobs are not even sometimes advertised

00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,620
on mainstream the best jobs that I've

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,560
got haven't come from me applying from

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,570
adverts and that is the way that women

00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,240
network that is the way that women get

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,980
jobs they don't get jobs by applying for

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,910
an advert so even if you put on your

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,830
advert flexible working they're not you

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,390
know they see that on every advert and

00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,950
their experience is when they've gone to

00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,110
an interview and asked about it

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,360
it's fridays from home isn't flexible

00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,150
working you know they can't drop the kid

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,060
off every day or I can't pick the kid up

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:31,400
and come on so that a little bit more in

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,020
a minute so the feedback again and

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,110
addressing behaviors that make people

00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,390
feel excluded so what I was able to do

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:42,410
is make sure I didn't recruit anyone who

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:44,120
displayed those behaviors however most

00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:47,060
of you will be dealing with a team that

00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,530
is already existing what you need to

00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,520
make sure is that they're not there and

00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:53,780
if they are there they are managed out

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,940
because if they're not you're not ever

00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,160
gonna get a diverse team if the people

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,130
are in there and they're making nervous

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:05,690
feel excluded forever we did a Women's

00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:09,890
Day then we did an international men's

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:11,480
day something and we put it online and

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,420
it was about a charity for testicular

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,240
cancer some of my guys work this for in

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,340
it and someone in not in tech in our

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,110
company but someone commented I'm sick

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,450
of all these days why do we have to have

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,549
all these days I don't care if you're

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,080
gay just don't tell me about it

00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,539
don't want to know I don't need a

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,850
woman's day a man's day international

00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:34,940
day by visibility you know and they just

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:38,419
went on this long run and you know that

00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:43,129
is what is going to really drive town

00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:44,570
job recruiting in your diversity and and

00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:46,220
that person wasn't in my team and they

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,679
weren't intact but they were in Aviva

00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,389
you know and they they felt that it was

00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,389
totally okay to express those opinions

00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:56,210
and they weren't in my team so I D deal

00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:59,629
with it I hope somebody did because that

00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:04,820
is what's gonna stop stuff oh I missed

00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:07,820
that one um making people feel like a

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:10,820
team when you recruit him trying not to

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:13,100
enforce this with alcohol and one of the

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,109
things about diversity is not everybody

00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:21,169
drinks not everyone wants to go to the

00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:22,580
pub so board games are really popular we

00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:25,190
didn't we've done so many different

00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,230
things the game about the music was one

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,419
of them that I've put to one side now

00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,799
but we've done egg throwing how far can

00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:33,139
you throw out without breaking it you

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,320
know building towers a lot of the

00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:39,769
standard stuff that people will done all

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:43,279
sorts of random shoe swapping stickers

00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:46,730
on heads making reindeers out of tights

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,679
with party balloons quizzes things like

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,480
that stuff so that you can do in a

00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:54,830
couple of hours you can take people out

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,859
of that and just make them not think

00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:00,710
about coding for a little bit and to

00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:03,169
bring them together as a team and to

00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,269
cross over from teams because what will

00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:07,639
happen is you'll get a scrum team or is

00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:10,279
actually you want a large team obviously

00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:13,489
I've got a team of 3040 people I want

00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:16,340
them to be a team as well as individual

00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:18,169
scrum teams and again see the feedback

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,529
about about the networking and how

00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:23,059
that's going so this is a bit of

00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:26,980
something about wife what I've talked

00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:29,899
about so taking people without a degree

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,590
the developer Academy is is the one me

00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:36,740
in Sheffield but also in-house training

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:38,780
at both HSBC before I moved to Aviva a

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,120
few years ago and

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:45,050
Aviva I've pulled people from their

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,090
in-house teams so I had four people in

00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,820
my Aviva team that were previously in a

00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:52,460
call center one of them had H and D in

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,870
computer science and then she she done

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,220
it in the part-time in the evening then

00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,530
carried on working in the call center

00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,880
for a via the Christie loved Aviva you

00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,380
know didn't want to do anything didn't

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,230
want to make the steppings working in

00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,900
taxi it was too intimidating and she

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:08,300
liked the company you know by networking

00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,120
with other senior managers in Aviva I

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,740
found out about her and pulled her in

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,530
again other senior managers and goings

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,800
health-and-safety me incest or dated a

00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,260
admin that you have to do as a manager

00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,690
finding out that they've got someone who

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,940
built their website little thing for

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,960
them and then oh it's really good but

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,060
you know he doesn't have any

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,740
qualifications but he's really keen he

00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,330
did this that and the other for me right

00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:37,090
well let's pull him in you know let's

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:41,210
have him as a trainee dev and HSBC like

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:44,600
we did it wasn't a formal apprenticeship

00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:47,600
scheme that I use there but I used to do

00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,490
a tech test and every year just bring in

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,600
one or two people that showed aptitude

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:55,640
and then get them in bring them as

00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,920
testers initially and if they can cope

00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,990
with the testing make the testing more

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,640
technical like automation engineers so

00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,230
they're coding the script in and and you

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,390
know some of them went went on to be

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,860
coders and some of them went on to be

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,590
scrum masters you know they'd have never

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,350
moved from like document processing or

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,150
wherever they were in the bank thing

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,980
bringing people in that have got

00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,780
business knowledge or they're loyal to

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,110
your company it's really going to help

00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:25,090
with retention because recruitments no

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:27,980
good without your retention so open days

00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:31,340
we used to do a lot of Forge open days

00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,780
in Aviva in Sheffield there are about

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:36,520
two and a half thousand people on-site

00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:39,050
with one office with like 40 or desks

00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:43,100
half people don't even know where there

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:46,280
is an office so loads of open days cakes

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,890
tea and coffee mornings the first one we

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,600
did was International Women today but it

00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,820
didn't have to be you know necessarily

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,890
we just say why

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,600
on Friday we're going to do an open day

00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,490
anyone who wants to know more about the

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,790
digital work that Aviva does can come

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:03,800
along um you know we just make people

00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,550
cups of coffee talk about what we do why

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,920
we do it

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:08,480
you know and how we got into it and what

00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,010
they might need you know

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,160
well maybe you sound really good you

00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:15,440
really process orientated you know what

00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,880
about design and daily a flow map in

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,800
things like that so talk to him about

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,870
the sort of soft skills that can be

00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:25,550
converted into tech skills and then

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:30,860
makes you a flexible means flexible this

00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:32,360
is huge because what I got was people

00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,250
working for me who needed that

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,280
flexibility that wouldn't have gone to

00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:40,700
work for sky back here my massive

00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:44,060
competitors William Hill they are Java

00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:46,130
shops near me that will take and will

00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:49,790
pay twenty to thirty grand more than I

00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:52,510
can play them at Aviva so I need to

00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:56,030
compete on working environment

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:58,070
flexibility trust openness those values

00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:01,160
have to mean something and flexibility

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,110
has to mean flexible because they have

00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,730
to want to work somewhere for a lower

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:09,530
pay when they know they can earn more

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:12,290
and that's important so a couple of them

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:16,970
really amazed in tech needs I had one of

00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:19,130
them his wife it's got Emmy they have a

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,730
lot of stuff you know around her illness

00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,580
so he often needs to just take two hours

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:27,050
and that's fine he just takes two hours

00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,720
doesn't matter when it is doesn't even

00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,580
tell me anymore because you know I said

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,860
oh you know I'm not I'm not calculating

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,540
your two hours I'm not sitting there and

00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,360
knocking it back on it saying at the end

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,650
of the week did you do that two hours

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,800
because it's flexibility and

00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:44,360
responsibility and not micromanagement

00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:47,240
and and the other thing you need is

00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,910
having I'm not the head of Aviva I'm a

00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,500
long way down from the head of Aviva you

00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:56,390
need layers above you that are really

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:58,670
supporting this so the person who was my

00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:02,060
head of department at the time was Pete

00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:04,070
Marsden he wasn't to say him that he was

00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,970
interested in diverse teams he wasn't to

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:09,090
say anyone it's building et

00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,850
he meant it he set his own targets you

00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,650
know he set his targets around the same

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,110
thing stuff that was optional he's told

00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:19,350
you set any goal heats at least for

00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:22,080
himself as well and stop men when I said

00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:24,990

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,420
can I give my team can they come and

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,190
teach code first girls with me yeah can

00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,370
I have a budget for code first girls and

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:34,590
