then

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,320
found himself within their sort of

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,000
healthcare sector so um

what he values is important within

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,000
um his team and how that relates to

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,600
people potentially outside of the

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,720
healthcare sector as well

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,920

startups both within the healthcare

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,279

transformation in the new normal

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,240
um so yeah i mean the new normal is

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,639
something where

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,000
it still feels very abnormal um but it's

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,040
gonna be really interesting to see how

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,920

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,040
the benefits of medical research

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,720
faster so we are basically a global

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,519
company working throughout the whole

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,399
clinical trial process

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,399
so we have a an office in london which

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,600
is based in hammersmith obviously we're

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,799
all working remote now with the current

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,520
situation

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,280
but we have 10 engineering teams based

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,039
there

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,240
along with that we also have remote

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,000
teams based in india with a vendor

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,280
roughly about the same amount same

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,959
number

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,880
and they they pair up with the teams

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,959
that we have we have in the uk

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,360
we have a software as a service platform

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,960
that is completely on the cloud

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,600
and our tech stack is primarily scala

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,200
apis we do have some java services and

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,400
java tooling

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,120
as well as our ui is based on react and

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,120
node.js

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,240
so doing a talk on building a tech

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
culture it's

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,919
it's important to maybe try and

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,919
understand what culture is

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,640
because it's difficult to to pin down

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,559
the definition because culture means

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,559
different things to different people

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:10,160
now one of the most probably popular

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,919
quotes around culture is culture eats

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,360
strategy for breakfast which is

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,960
accredited to

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,520
to peter drunker and this is true

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,320
because no matter how good your strategy

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,240
is

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,880
there's a human factor to how successful

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,840
your

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,600
your projects will be and you can search

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,720
online for

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,760
you know definitions about culture but

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,440
one that's always stuck me is

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,919
your culture is every decision you make

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,720
i heard this on a talk um some time ago

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,039
unfortunately i can't remember who by

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,799
but it stuck with me because because i

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,600
really believe that it's true that your

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,880
your culture is basically driven by

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,280
every person

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,640
in your organization in your tech teams

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,799
and by the decisions that they make

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,480
it's not something that can be pushed

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,720
down from the top and

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,240
no matter how many posters you put

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
around the office or

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,760
colorful bean bags there are lying

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,120
around that that doesn't give you your

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,679
culture

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,600
it's the people that do that and i i

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,720
believe that it's

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,440
the responsibility of all of the

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,760
managers the leadership to provide them

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,679
in

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,840
an environment where your culture can

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,840
grow

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,520
so i'm going to go through what kind of

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,799
forms the basis for our culture and

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,559
metadata

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,280
and how our tech culture grows on top of

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,600
that

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,840
but i'll also be providing just say

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,720
personal opinions around some leadership

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,799
and

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,360
management that apply to that that are

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,360
related

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,640
so an essential part of building any

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,280
culture is to have a

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,400
a mission something that that people

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,640
believe that they

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,440
they can be part of at many data we're

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,960
united around a single goal that

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,880
together we power

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,840
smarter treatments and healthier people

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,960
this means that at medi-data we're more

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,720
than just a

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,320
technology company we we believe we're

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,320
building an architecture of hope

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,640
and this is a powerful mission because

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,559
it's changing people's lives for the

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,039
better

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,280
it's even more crucial now in the the

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,559
current pandemic that we're in

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,760
and everyone at medidata is part of this

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,240
this mission every day

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,520
i mean metadata our tech teams are no

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,799
different to other

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,640
other tech teams we're we're busy there

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,480
can be pressure on we're delivering

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,480
features and supporting our customers

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,360
so i believe that it's it's important to

00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:01,440
to remind everyone remind the teams

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,000
about what our mission is so that

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,720
when the days are hard when we are let's

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,559
say bogged down in all of our work

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,080
we need to see what that what that value

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,480
of that work is all about

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,360
and look at our mission to see what that

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,320
is delivering

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,880
because that provides an extra focus and

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,840
extra

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
energy into what we're doing because of

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,080
the impact

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,080
that our work can have

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,120
so i believe that this mission is let's

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,200
say the the base layer to

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,159
to our culture it's a common purpose

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,679
throughout

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,679
which which we build upon

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,919
so next many data we have

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,520
say core principles but i would say that

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,480
one of the core values

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,000
of many data is that of caring and you

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,320
can see that in

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,080
the five founding principles that there

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,840
is a mediator

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,240
which is diversity and belonging

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,720
sustainability

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,960
employee wellness volunteering and

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,400
philanthropy

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,360
now medidata is a mission-driven company

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,360
that

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,760
sees the diversity of its employees is a

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,960
tremendous asset

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,000
and the values creating a sense of

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,919
belonging throughout the company so not

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,360
only does many data care

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,960
about its employees but it also don't

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,360
cares about the environment around us

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,919
one example of this can be seen in a

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,960
project where medidata uk

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,080
partnered with the hammersmith business

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:42,080
improvement district to work on a pilot

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:46,720
program where to improve the

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:50,320
the green space and the air quality um

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,640
in the area and this resulted in some

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,360
parklets being created pretty much

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,520
directly outside of our office so the

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,120
the public and the community can use

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,720
these as well as

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,400
people at media can see that this is

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,559
something

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,840
that the company has been part of that

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,080
they want to change and help the

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,600
community

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,240
but they're also throughout the company

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,400
there are volunteering opportunities and

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,360
programs where employees can give back

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,960
to the community as well

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:26,080
so this is just a quick overview but it

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:29,200
helps to show the aspects of metadata

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,000
um how it is a caring organization it

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,559
cares for

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
customers it's for employees cares for

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,840
patients and it cares for the

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,840
environment around us

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,960
i wanted to share this because i believe

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,000
that it's important because it

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,039
it's basically medi-data's dna it really

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,080
is what metadata is is all about

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,240
and this is what um

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,480
what our employees or our teams are all

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,720
part of

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,799
so we have we have these principles but

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,320
then many data strives for

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:07,360
three things as part of its culture

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,360
which are openness

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,360
collaboration and fun

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,720
so looking at our now looking at our

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,799
tech culture

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,320
we can build on top of these build on

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,520
top of the openness collaboration and

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,520
fun within our teams

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,640
i do see that openness openness is

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,760
important in any tech teams because

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,520
ultimately

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,880
you want people to be themselves at work

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,240
for this to happen we need to create an

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,279
environment that

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,240
ultimately fosters psychological safety

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,600
so that people can be themselves and

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,559
feel that they're in their safe

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,159
environment within their teams

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,919
now there are many talks on

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,279
psychological safety and the aspects

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,320
around that but i

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,000
i believe that it's the um engineering

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,440
manager's responsibility to

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,480
ensure that their teams are a safe place

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,400
for people for people to express

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,880
their opinions to express their feelings

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,880
and this doesn't come for free

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,720
it takes effort and i believe some

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,159
areas to do this are building

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,080
relationships

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,159
ultimately this is down to building

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,480
trust within the teams

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,320
this can be this can be done through

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,000
regular one-to-ones

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,919
but it's about getting to know the

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,679
people in your team

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,919
know what's important to them they're

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,799
about their families remembering their

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,559
their birthdays sometimes it's it's the

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,200
simplest of things that makes a big

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,559
difference

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,240
to a person but it it helps them

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,679
feel more comfortable let's say feel

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,039
themselves and

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,240
once you get that they can be more open

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:55,039
and then it's about being role models um

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,159
i i really really believe that

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,320
particularly as

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,679
managers we should be role models to

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,760
others so

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,600
with we're asking our teams to do

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,120
certain things yeah if we go and do the

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,720
opposite that's not setting a great

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,400
example and it won't

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,760
certainly lead to other people wanting

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,400
to

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,919
to do the same thing but it's also about

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,520
people within the teams being role

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,880
models for each other

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,120
so that we can um so it's how we react

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,720
to mistakes and how open we are to other

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,760
people's ideas

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,440
all of this is about being an example to

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,400
others but it helps

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,440
all leads to that openness and then

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,159
actively

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,640
listening i i mean we can all be very

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,520
good at

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,000
talking but actively listening

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,679
ultimately

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,799
is a skill and it's certainly something

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,640
that i'm working on

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,480
but it shows that you care it shows you

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,159
care about

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,120
you know who's talking to you care about

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,440
what they're saying and you want to

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,799
learn more about it and then that helps

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,960
that person feel

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,960
more comfortable as well feel valued

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,720
and then giving feedback is is an

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,840
important part of building any culture

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,039
both positive and constructive

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:13,200
whether it's at a team level through

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:15,120
retrospectives or even in one-to-ones

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,799
feedback shows that you you care about

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,240
someone you want to give them

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,320
positive feedback to encourage

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,760
encourage what they're doing but also

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,000
constructive to help them

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,520
in any areas that they're looking to

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,039
work on any areas that may need

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,520
development but ultimately it shows that

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,520
you care

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,960
now i believe that these these are key

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,120
areas that

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,080
that help people feel safe in themselves

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,880
um at work and ultimately provide an

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,240
opportunity

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:51,840
for for a culture of openness

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,279
now moving on to collaboration

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,120
you know collaboration is important

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,640
particularly when you have distributed

00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,640
teams

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,399
and although autonomy is important to us

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,960
we want to have we want to make sure

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,080
that we're learning from each other

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,880
um constantly

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,320
now i put this i put collaboration into

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,679
different areas so

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,600
first of all like leadership

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,120
collaboration i see this is

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,799
it's kind of one of the the most

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,200
important areas because

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,080
having partnerships with your peers in

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,200
the organization is essential for

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,720
um improving and helping your teams

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,320
but also making your workplace better

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,080
we have obviously the usual slack

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,919
channels where we can

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,760
update people and ask questions this is

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,520
good

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,279
but we also wanted something that can

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,080
help the collaboration and learn from

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,919
each other

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,080
i mean this led to having what we've

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,640
called a leadership forum

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,440
so this is every month we is in the

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,120
leaders

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,880
managers the directors would get

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,440
together and

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,960
just have open discussions around what's

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,840
important to our teams

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,520
all the topics are driven by us within

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,840
the teams

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,679
and so that basically we're raising and

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,520
discussing

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,919
anything that's that's kind of important

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,279
to us so that we can make improvements

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,120
and see how other teams are working

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,960
i would say that the the picture you see

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,880
on the slides isn't isn't a leadership

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,279
forum in action this was a

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,520
this was a social just where we we're

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,360
building relationships but

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,799
but that's another key part of this that

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,640
i've really enjoyed is

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,399
it's helped us build relationships with

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,080
other managers so i've got to know some

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,559
of the managers

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,600
through this that maybe i wouldn't have

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,720
normally

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,039
just in the office environment but this

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,840
leadership forum has really helped us

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,799
improve on areas within our tech culture

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,000
um

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,640
so that we've we've learned

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,799
um how other teams operate now that's

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,960
not to say that we want our team to to

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,600
work exactly the same

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,279
but we can't find common patterns we can

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,000
find good things within teams that we

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,000
may want to

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,320
put into others but it's also around

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,880
maybe like initiatives we've improved

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,320
our hiring process

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,240
we've learned to how best or how

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,000
we can improve certain adopting certain

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,640
practices like devops

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,240
this is still in progress but we can

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,840
discuss at this level ways

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,440
things that are working as part of that

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,840
and things that may need improvement but

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,159
we discuss and we collaborate together

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:33,440
to do that so

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:36,880
the next one is is team collaboration

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,159
now even before lockdown collaboration

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,919
is important across our teams and

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,080
because we've got different teams across

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,159
different time zones

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,000
so the communication and that

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,880
collaboration has been essential for our

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,360
culture

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,120
and obviously we have our slack channels

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,320
across the teams

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,320
and video chats that's all important for

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,559
for building our culture but what we

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,279
wanted to to do is to try and avoid

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,559
some of the silos within our teams and

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,440
find ways that

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,399
that we can share knowledge across them

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,320
so we

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,559
we started an initiative to help break

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,000
down some of these silos some

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,360
the initiative is called meditech

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,760
so we see this as say a mini conference

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,600
or a get-together of all of the

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,840
the engineering teams to share

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,600
what what work they're working on or

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,120
what's important that could be relevant

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,120
to other people

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:38,000
so every month we have two or three

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,519
talks that can be anything about what

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,799
the team is doing or what they think

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,559
another team might

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,159
might find valuable so

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,320
over the course of how long it's been

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,120
running we've had 31 talks and

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,200
32 speakers and eight different hosts so

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,679
what this provides us is an opportunity

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,679
not only for sharing knowledge but for

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,600
people in the team to practice their

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,880
public speaking

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,000
or even hosting an event

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,039
but i i believe that this meditek has

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,240
been a real big part of our tech culture

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,080
um it's just great to see

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,000
how how people have been building

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,279
relationships based on a talk people

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,240
have been wanting to

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,840
chat discuss work with each other on the

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,279
ideas that they've heard so that they

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,519
can

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,720
learn more about it or see how that it

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,840
can apply to them but also this

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,279
meditek has grown um to different

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,720
countries we've had

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,840
japan have been having their own

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,360
meditechs but also

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,440
other countries have joined our many

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,559
tech so we've had speakers from japan or

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,960
the us

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,559
from their engineering teams that have

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,080
have come and shared information that

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,320
could be relevant for us

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,159
so it really has built on this culture

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,600
of collaboration

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:58,799
not only within london but across

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,799
the tech organization

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,840
and then as well as team there is just

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,840
individual collaboration as well this is

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,440
where obviously as managers we can work

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,720
with individuals on

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,720
on anything that

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,559
could be important to work on skills or

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,679
anything that needs

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,360
neat areas of development but also pair

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,120
programming as well that's important for

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,200
individuals to work and collaborate

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,000
together

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
so i really believe i've enjoyed all of

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
this

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,960
this collaboration all of the leadership

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,440
the team

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,880
and individually because it's really

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,799
built on

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,120
medidata's core principle of belonging

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,320
where we've been collaborating across

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,320
all these different levels

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,840
and then when we move on to fun now

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,480
you know the teams are they work hard

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
and

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,240
and they are under pressure at certain

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,440
times so it's important that we

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,760
we can have fun along the way

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,640
and having fun is a key part of our

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,679
culture

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:14,079
and we do this in a variety of ways

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,560
we do have regular hackathons

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,679
where teams can groups of people can

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,240
work together to

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,520
obviously achieve whatever the project

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,879
is

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:28,639
we have team meals and drinks

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:31,200
we have sports events now

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,240
admittedly some of you you may not see a

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,800
sports event is

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,879
is much fun but but there is also a

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,040
social aspect to all of this where

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,000
people who may may not be wanting to run

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,639
but they enjoy

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,919
joining just for the social social

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,200
interaction

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,119
but then throughout the year there's

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,000
also many other

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,480
social events whether it's the office as

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,159
a whole

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,000
or just the tech teams just about

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,079
working just about being with the team

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,040
and having fun

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,079
but obviously as now we're all in

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,560
lockdown it's important

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,599
to maintain that because to try and

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,720
avoid

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,320
um situations where anyone is feeling

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,839
isolated or lonely

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,079
it's important to maintain

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,920
maintain those con the connections that

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,760
we have in our teams which is hard when

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,560
we are all fully remote

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,240
so again this this takes effort but it's

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,520
we've been doing this through

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,280
uh remote drinks where online games

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,839
and team events but but what we've seen

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,320
is it's

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,079
good to see the teams you know working

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,720
together having a bit of fun even

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,119
through obviously the situation we're

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,000
all

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:47,520
in now where we are all working remotely

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,040
all of this all this these um events and

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,960
all these opportunities

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,520
just keeps the moment away from the the

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,440
work or the challenges we have just to

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,520
just to have fun with some of the

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,839
friends that we have in the office

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,839
so i

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,839
so i see see all of that as all part of

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,640
our

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,359
our culture and building our culture but

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,079
it is a journey and it's

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,119
it's a journey that i never i never

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,359
really believe that we

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,760
will get to you will never get to an end

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,280
of you never be finished

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,480
i think that one thing you can be sure

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,040
of is that the change is guaranteed

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,800
organizations evolve people change the

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,200
environment around us

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,440
um can be unpredictable as we're very

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,400
much seeing at the moment

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,599
so a sense of a healthy culture is one

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,680
that gets stronger

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,000
and this is what we see at many data in

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,440
our teams that

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that what we've seen around us we

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,599
we are we work together we work with

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,599
each other

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,760
through challenges through different

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,599
circumstances this is where we

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,839
we help each other out we look out for

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,280
each other and we grow stronger through

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,280
that as a united team

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,560
and the uh you know ultimately that we

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,920
can change

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,280
adapt to change together obviously we've

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,119
had a big change

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,320
with lockdown and ultimately when we

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,119
look at our

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,880
engineering teams this although it's a

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,200
big change of all going fully remote

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,960
this

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,040
is actually had minimal impact on our

00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,280
productivity now ultimately you can say

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,280
that

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,520
no no commuting has had an impact on

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,200
that and that's true

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,760
but it's also the mindset and the

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,400
attitudes of the people in the teams

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,760
who have continued wanting to to work

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,800
together they've known that

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,800
our mission um and what we we

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,000
what we're delivering to our customers

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,119
and that's helped us

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,800
to adapt to changes and the big changes

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,880
that we're seeing around us

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,040
and obviously keep that culture that we

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,599
that we have at many data

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,960
but also it's more than kind of adapting

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,400
to changes

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,320
around us in the environment that are

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,400
unpredictable but it's also bringing in

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,599
new changes within an organization maybe

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,240
new practices

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,680
i mentioned earlier around devops now

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,960
ultimately this can be a big change for

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,800
people in the organization it's

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,000
different ways of doing things

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,480
but this again is where our culture

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,400
is a strength because this is where we

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,800
work together we're open

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,079
um around maybe some of the difficulties

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,000
we're having around this some of the

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,760
things we're not quite sure about

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,359
and when we're collaborating together

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,760
we're working together

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:36,160
to gradually get get to a better place

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,640
with with any new practices or any new

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,560
changes to come in this is all a sign of

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,920
the healthy culture the strong culture

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,920
that we have at many data

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,839
so to summarize

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,839
our tech culture is built on our

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,240
powerful mission

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,760
our core principles which has a strong

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,800
sense of caring

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,000
as well as striving for an environment

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,040
of openness

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,320
collaboration and fun

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,000
and this enables us to to nurture our

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,400
strongest talent

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,200
the people because ultimately we want

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,240
people who

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,720
want our our teams to be who they want

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,760
to

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,839
be to be themselves and ultimately have

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,359
an opportunity to be where they want to

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:24,720
be

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,320
um and we believe that we we can give

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,119
the people a safety

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,680
um and the environment for them to do

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,880
that

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,000
within mediator and i believe that all

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,560
of this

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,320
um all of this has helped metadata

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,440
become

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,599
one of the best places to work with

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,160
voted for this year is a great place to

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,760
work we voted number 18 in a

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,400
in the large company category

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,880
so i i really do believe that it is

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,520
every decision that

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,200
that defines our culture and that

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,680
metadata we are

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,960
we are building a culture we are

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,000
building our technology

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,000
it is a journey but we're working

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,720
we're working together making decisions

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,000
to help us

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,000
improve and be better

00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:25,839
thank you

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,040
okay cool i think that's all good

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,880
uh thank you very much for that stephen

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,920
it was a really really good presentation

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,040
um we're gonna go to the q a now

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,079
and uh if you have any questions uh

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,119
please do leave them

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,920
into in the comment section

00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,000
um i'm just filling in for duncan as

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,359
well temporarily whilst he's having

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,880
some connection issues so i'm just going

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,240
to fill in the gap there we might have

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,200
him back later we'll see

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,560
if that works out um but uh stephen

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,319
venkat thank you very much

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,319
do you do do you have any questions for

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,800
each other

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,640
definitely yeah um you mentioned like uh

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,520
you are uh

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,160
managing uh you have ten teams actually

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,599
over here

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,319
right how many of them actually you

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,319
manage uh

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,000
yeah sure so um two london teams are

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,640
managing one

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,640
team in india

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,960
all right okay great so also like kind

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,680
of uh

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,800
you you know we went to the lockdown

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,000
actually sometimes back

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,119
and um you might have actually faced

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,240
quite a lot of challenges uh in you know

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,040
bringing together

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,280
um the team how actually this has

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,400
impacted uh any productivity uh

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,440
in in your in your work in the way

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,800
you work usually work at you yes

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,400
so productivity itself was actually

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,400
good in it you could we can argue that

00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,000
it increased as well so

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,359
i think one of the big challenges

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,119
that at least was on my mind there's

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,960
around people who are isolated obviously

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,119
you've just gone for a big change

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,720
we're all in lockdown as it were a lot

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,160
of things going on in the environment in

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,440
the society

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,200
so i wanted to ensure that um

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,440
people who are isolated or lonely that

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,079
they that the connections were still

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,480
there even if they're at home alone that

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,040
um

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,119
that they could still you know obviously

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,640
the team connections the relationships

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,720
that was still a priority

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,800
so that was that was a key part the

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,319
other thing that we noticed is that

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,240
as soon as you hit lockdown kind of

00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,599
everyone canceled their holidays

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,800
you know which is fine as expected um

00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,680
but it's still important that people

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,200
take time off we entered march and april

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,800
where people were kind of

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,240
continuously at their screens and it's

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,839
it's important to courage people

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,319
encourage teams to

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,440
take some time off even if it's you know

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,880
like a staycation

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,480
or that they're not going out it's

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,119
important just to not be at the screen

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,160
all the time

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,599
so trying to encourage that it

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,119
can be challenging because we know

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,880
there's there's not many opportunities

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,040
around to go anywhere but

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,160
again it's it's about being a role model

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,920
as well and i

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,800
you know i try to take time off myself

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,560
as well so um and to show the team that

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,680
it is okay to take time off and they

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,720
should do just for

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,000
for their own health great

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,960
and you know uh you have teams in

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,920
different locations

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,960
and probably like you know um came from

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,040
um

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,000
other organization also may be working

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,599
with you actually

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,079
how do you make sure like you know they

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:38,480
come into the same culture and

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,079
philosophy of media data

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,680
yes i mean working with vendors

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,160
obviously it's always slightly different

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,160
because

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,839
there's no line management like no line

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,280
management there but

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,520
you know obviously we we all have our

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,440
mission and our mission is is important

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,079
and they're part of that

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,119
so but it's still for me a lot of this

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,880
just comes down to building

00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,079
relationships getting to know them

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,000
building the trust

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,680
and it's just like another person to

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,440
another person no matter where they are

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,480
or who they're working for

00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,560
uh that that's kind of really

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,319
what what i believe in and what i try

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,680
and install in teams is just build up

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,079
those relationships

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,040
help people to try and be open and

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,359
encourage

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,040
um conversations or you know people to

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,880
share opinions

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,400
and ultimately working together working

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,800
for each other those are

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,319
those are the kind of the key areas that

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,520
then it breaks down barriers it doesn't

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,520
matter where you are where you're

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,960
located what country

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,560
if you're a vendor team or you're part

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,079
of meditating because we're all

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,200
we're all trying to do the same thing

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:40,240
we're all you know we have the same goal

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,680
so those are kind of how i how i kind of

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,040
stare and

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,040
build that culture from there

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,240
i think that's all from me

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,599
um i'm just curious are there any

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
particular activities that you've been

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,520
able to do

00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,560
as with your colleagues um you know

00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,560
outside of work hours

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,359
so yeah most of this stuff is kind of

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,760
remote so we have a bit of fun

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:11,599
kind of with drinks um video video chats

00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,760
what we can do and online games

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,520
obviously is a big thing just to kind of

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,560
take your mind off work and

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,240
have a bit of fun really so

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,400
i guess you are quite limited in what we

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,760
can do but it's still important just to

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,480
you know there may be little things even

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,839
like a 10-minute game but it can still

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,839
kind of be important just have a bit of

00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:32,480
fun maybe laugh about you know whatever

00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:34,400
it is that you're trying to do that

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,000
those are the types of things we we

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,119
continue to do

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,800
yeah i think there's been a big

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,319
insurgency in sort of resurgence in like

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,599
online gaming as well like people are

00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,800
doing that with their colleagues like

00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,599
during their lunch hours and

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,960
i think there was even one uh agency a

00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,119
creative agency i heard that were

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,480
hosting all of their meetings

00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,160
on red dead redemption online

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,680
so they were logging into the game with

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,760
their charac you know with their

00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,200
uh characters and then all sitting

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,160
around the campfire and actually having

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,839
a meeting

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,040
about work all around it and um

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,400
then like all these different things

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,200
would happen like during the game like

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,119
somebody you know

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,800
would get on their horses and then ride

00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,280
off and stuff just like but that's a

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,440
really

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,560
clever creative way of actually getting

00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,119
around some of these kind of

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,720
tedious things that we have to do now

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,560
we've been playing a bit of pictionary

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,400
so that's always quite good fun

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,640
testing our drawing skills or lack of

00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,079
drawing skills

00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,079
yeah yeah okay cool um so

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,359
i guess this is now time to uh take us

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,400
over to you venkat with your

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,000
presentations so

00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,520
uh i'll just queue that up now and we'll

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,040
be able to go in a second

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,800
thanks yeah i think there are a few more

00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,480
questions for steve from the audience

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,079
um oh yeah i forgot to even check

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,200
actually uh i was keeping an eye and it

00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,480
didn't seem like anything was coming

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,359
through but that's good

00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,280
okay let's take a look what we got so

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,280
raphael has asked um have you found that

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,800
the culture has evolved which i

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,839
were quite requiring documented culture

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,839
to be revised

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,800
um i'm not really sure what we mean by

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,240
documented culture

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,920
to be honest um

00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,440
yeah me neither actually maybe you can

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,640
clarify raphael

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,520
we can we can uh ask again andrew has

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,440
asked uh

00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,119
you mentioned active listening how have

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,680
you learned to hone those skills as a

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,319
manager over the years

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,800
yeah in personally speaking it's

00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,960
actually

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,559
taken a bit of effort i'm quite easily

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,960
distracted

00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,960
and i think it is just really focusing

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,960
on removing distractions

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,240
um this is you know whether you're

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,160
talking to the person in the flesh

00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:42,319
obviously in the office or even

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,119
um over video it's just trying to remove

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,640
distractions

00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,119
obviously focus on what the person is

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,960
saying listening to what they're saying

00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,640
and then obviously not thinking too far

00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,960
ahead with what you want to say next as

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,160
opposed to um

00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,680
you know try and follow on with what

00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,559
they're saying with maybe deeper

00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,319
questions that's

00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,599
that's probably the biggest thing that i

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,040
had is

00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,720
based on what they're saying how can you

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,920
get a bit deeper in that instead of

00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,359
maybe changing the subject with

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,640
something else you you just want to save

00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,960
you're just waiting for them to finish

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,440
it

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,000
so that that's kind of something that's

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,319
worked for me

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,920
raphael did actually have a sec another

00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,680
question after that as well which was

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,359
how have you addressed team members that

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,359
have not been following the principles

00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:23,520
of company culture

00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,760
what's the company process to correct or

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,960
redirect behavior not aligned with the

00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,960
culture or values

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,160
it's quite tricky one i like tricky

00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,280
questions

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,559
that's right yeah i mean it again is so

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,760
it's like relationships and it comes

00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,599
down to being open

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,880
and we we mentioned about that and as an

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,240
important part of the culture is

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,559
openness now

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,480
if there's things that kind of maybe

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,040
aren't quite aligning um

00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,640
or things that maybe aren't fitting with

00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,520
that it's about having an open

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,200
conversation

00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,800
and typically that will come down with a

00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,800
manager in a one-to-one

00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,160
just try and find out get it get a bit

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,280
deeper into

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,960
um you know are there any reasons for

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,400
for the behavior that we're seeing and

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,720
just try and understand it a bit more

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,280
and

00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,160
go from there basically see their their

00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,400
point

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,359
um see why potentially if there's any

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,480
reasons and

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,440
see if we can see how we can potentially

00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,960
look to

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,200
to change things going forward if

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,920
there's a you know particular pieces of

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,359
direction i can give for instance or you

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,640
know i'd like to see this going forward

00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:31,839
or why don't we try doing this

00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,480
there could be a you know quite a lot of

00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,800
different

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,319
reasons why things are not quite right

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,079
and it's important to try and understand

00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:40,160
that understand from their point of view

00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,839
instead of making assumptions and then

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,559
we can work together on trying to see

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,319
how we can

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,720
obviously fit towards the culture going

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,720
forwards

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,200
for sure we have one last question as

00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,240
well

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,680
from magdalena how do you assess

00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,200
team fit in quotation marks team fit

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,920
to a company culture during your

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,520
recruitment process

00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,599
you know i think it's one of the most

00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,200
challenging things to

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,640
assess whether someone will fit

00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,359
culturally in the space of

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,880
say 30 minutes or an hour and i think

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,920
you can ask

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,880
kind of behavioral questions around how

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,280
would you acted

00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,119
in this types of situations or scenario

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,559
based questions and i think

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:27,280
we are limited and we we have to go by

00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,119
and by those types of questions and you

00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,640
know ultimately get a get a feeling

00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,160
based on

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,000
not only the answers to those questions

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,960
but generally across across the whole

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,359
interview

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,480
how how how do you think they always fit

00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:42,240
and

00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,839
we can never we can never be 100 um

00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,160
sure whatever happens there's always

00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,760
that risk but i think the more

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,920
questions we can try and find out to

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,400
find out how people help people

00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,760
what their feelings are what type of

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,359
person they are

00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,280
i think they're they're the important

00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,160
parts of an interview

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,640
to try and understand what means

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,839
something to that person

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,640
sure that's good raphael has also just

00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,400
clarified

00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,760
on his first question so what he meant

00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,000
by documented

00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,520
culture was you know how the culture has

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,599
been written

00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,240
within within the company um

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,160
have they been the same or changed yeah

00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,160
so i mean i wouldn't say

00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,599
um so how it's written you know very

00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,280
much

00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,880
how you can get to do on the company

00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,640
website it's quite

00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,880
um let's say open in in

00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,680
or there's a lot of freedom let's say in

00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,400
whether it's

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,079
openness collaboration culture there um

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,280
it's not like a set of rules that you

00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,079
should do this or this

00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,760
it's it's kind of trying to encourage in

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,520
in those and it's expectations on the

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,559
managers to encourage that within their

00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,880
teams

00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:54,559
so it's not i i don't see it

00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,079
it's kind of a rules-based culture and

00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,280
it obviously that's it's important not

00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,040
to be if that's what we mean by a

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,280
documented culture it's

00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,040
it's more trying to encourage the the

00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,400
bigger kind of openness collaboration

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,480
and fun as opposed to

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,800
like a fine grain well openness means

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,720
this and you have to do this that's

00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,480
that's not what it is within many days

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,760
now

00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,839
that's great uh oh we have

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,880
one more question just come in so we'll

00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,480
do that we'll have to make that one the

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,880
last one so we can stick to the schedule

00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,280
but

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,760
uh krishna has said do you face any

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,240
parity issues between on-site and vendor

00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,559
teams

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,520
if yes how did you handle it

00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,680
you know i think there's always

00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:37,200
difference between on-site and

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,280
vendor or even remote you could say um

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,319
you know ultimately vendors they don't

00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,000
work for you they

00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,760
you know you're you're giving them a job

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,559
and you're you're paying them to do a

00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,559
certain task

00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,480
so there's always always the cultural

00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,160
difference but

00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,599
i think i really do think that it comes

00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,280
down to building relationships

00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,800
ultimately they're people and they you

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,000
want to get the best out of them as much

00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,920
as you do with

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
with the own your own team say that your

00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,000
line manager and i think if you

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,240
if you begin to if they understand you

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
you begin to get to know them not just

00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,440
for the work they're doing but personal

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,559
relationships as well learn more about

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,000
them as people

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,680
and i think you can break down any

00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,760
barriers and there is no

00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,960
there is no difference between you know

00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,319
when you're actually doing the work

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,920
whether they work for medi-data or

00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,640
whether they work for a vendor company

00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,160
they're still

00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,800
you still want to get the best out of

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,040
them and if you if they

00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,240
they feel open and freedom in what

00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,640
they're doing then i think that's

00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,640
that's the best way for any teams to

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,359
operate

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,160
brilliant yeah that's great uh if

00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,640
anybody has any

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,920
other questions uh please feel free to

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,960
write them in the comments and we'll

00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,000
take it hopefully into

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,680
an extended uh discussion after uh we've

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,920
heard from uh venkat

00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,599
and uh i think that's perfect time now

00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,240
just to go over to your talk now venkat

00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,720
so

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,720
um just bear with us one second thank

00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:59,280
you

00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,319
hi uh we'll take a look at uh

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,440
transformation

00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:06,160
uh in new norm uh in this

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,200
uh presentation a little bit about

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,040
myself um

00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,559
i am vegantech balakumar i am an

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,960
experienced cto

00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,440
i've been head of technology roles in

00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,359
many organizations

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,559
i'm also helping a lot of startups um

00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,440
i've worked with lot of financial

00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,839
services

00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,000
i'm an advocate of cloud ai machine

00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,800
learning

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,400
big data and devops have created quite a

00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,720
lot of

00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:36,480
strategies built teams based on

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,480
these technologies

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,240
let's take a look at uh what the new

00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,799
normal

00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,359
um is all about so i'm not going to

00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,319
actually

00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:47,760
bore you with uh what we have actually

00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:51,200
encountered in the last

00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,000
few months i actually wanted to discuss

00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,599
about

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,799
what we are going to do now

00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,400
and what is going to happen in the near

00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:03,599
future

00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:07,440
this is based on business id so the

00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:09,760
business id and the strategy

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,440
that's the context so if you take a look

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,880
at what has happened in the last three

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,680
months which i want to quickly go

00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,799
through and

00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,400
this is not about the

00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:20,720
work or id which we are doing this is

00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,599
about some of the findings

00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,119
which scientists did in the last three

00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,160
or four months

00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,880
that period which we encountered in our

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,640
life

00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,559
probably once in a lifetime just

00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,960
happened for most of us

00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,040
hopefully let's keep it like that it

00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,520
happens only once in a lifetime

00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,319
um this lockdown was the longest period

00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,799
of quiet

00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:43,440
in the human history we all might have

00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,480
actually

00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,599
encountered that we all might have

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:54,240
felt it during this time

00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:58,000
less number of traffic quiet times

00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,400
so this is one of the byproducts

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,079
um of the lockdown many after many

00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,440
scientists did a lot of research during

00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,160
this lockdown period

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,520
uh which i'm not gonna bore you with um

00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,640
next comes

00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,520
um facebook data which um i actually

00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,720
found

00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:17,119
in one of the um zoom meetings which i

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,599
went recently uh with dx connect

00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,280
uh so facebook presented about uh what

00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,400
has actually changed during the last

00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,319
three months

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,520
um so one of the things which struck me

00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,359
was uh this

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,599
point where they say like 94 percent of

00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:33,599
the people who are using facebook

00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:36,160
actually changed their daily habit

00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,280
after kobe 19. this is like you know the

00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,680
time we get up

00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,319
the time we eat food the time we speak

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,880
with our

00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:44,559
other peoples because facebook do have

00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,680
data about our activities

00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,599
through their app as well as whatsapp

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,280
and what kind of things which we discuss

00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,760
with other people everything actually

00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,480
changed

00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,839
the whole world actually had gone

00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,480
through this change

00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,680
so these are some of the fun facts or

00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,760
facts about

00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:05,920
uh the logged on period let's go into

00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,880
uh the new normal let's define what's

00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,640
the

00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,000
new normal is the key performance

00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,960
indicators or

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,680
of the new normal so we always want

00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,200
business

00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,720
as usual in any situation

00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,119
that's what we're going to expect from

00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,440
the new normal also

00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,119
wherever we work from even though we are

00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,240
a part you know we have we want to

00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:30,000
actually work together

00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,839
we want to use technologies

00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,839
that actually keeps us together during

00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:36,720
this time this

00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:38,160
is actually the new normal which i'm

00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:42,160
going to talk about

00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,520
um in this uh presentation and

00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,200
one thing which might we might have

00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,880
noticed many of us might have actually

00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,200
encountered is uh

00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,359
um the dr and business continuity plans

00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,319
which we have done and tested in the

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,720
last

00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,359
so many years within our organizations

00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,640
you know

00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:02,079
like um i've seen um long ago

00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:05,359
um we'll ask one of the network uh

00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:08,000
person to go and sit um in one of the

00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:10,400
routers near the routers and then we'll

00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
call them up and then we'll ask them to

00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,720
pull the plug and then we'll just do the

00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,520
test

00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,079
um and then we'll also do the uh test by

00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,240
asking people to work from home more

00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,079
uh trying to find out whether our

00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,520
network is capable of handling that so

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:29,680
those plans which we tested

00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:32,720
before is now being done on real time

00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:35,680
so these are uh the

00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,680
kpis or these are the indicators which

00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,880
we can

00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:43,680
have in the new normal so

00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,920
the main point here is business as usual

00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,359
in

00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,920
any situation that's what we are

00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:50,960
actually aiming to do

00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,640
um during the last three months i had

00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,480
the opportunity to speak with so many

00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,680
people in organizations

00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:01,680
um meetings um from my home

00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,680
and i found out so many

00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:06,000
outputs from those meetings and inputs

00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,000
from the people

00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,680
who attended the meetings so i created a

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,240
small swot analysis

00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,160
on what i discussed what i heard what i

00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:17,280
gathered as a data from them

00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,000
so looking at this analysis of the new

00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,880
normal actually

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,480
what has happened what is happening now

00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,040
uh many people say like uh

00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,240
they are seeing better meetings compared

00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:30,400
to what

00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:34,240
um they used to be having before

00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:37,359
um the the pandemic or kobe 19

00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:41,200
so they're able to meet quickly

00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:43,119
and then decide quickly on many aspects

00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,799
within the organization so that's one of

00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,760
the strengths which i which many people

00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:48,960
actually said

00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:52,400
is happening which i've also seen

00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:56,240
personally a lot of collaborations

00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:58,160
more collaborations increased between um

00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,480
the people within the organization and

00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,599
within the vendors um

01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,400
and other people who are

01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,520
giving support so using various

01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,880
technologies

01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:14,559
uh not only using uh chats

01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,880
not only using emails but um

01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,960
personally what i use usually do is like

01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,240
i keep a team

01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,000
whatsapp group for all the teams

01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,200
with whom i work with i still actually

01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,280
maintain them and then keep in

01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,520
connection with them

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,160
that helps us to quickly send a message

01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,280
to them and then

01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,319
[Music]

01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,520
do some work as and when needed uh so

01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,040
wherever they are you know

01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,400
if they're not able to pick up the

01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,760
message immediately they'll be able to

01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,520
pick it up when they go home

01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:47,040
or when they actually see the um

01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:49,280
mobile phone um so that's

01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,559
how actually this has happened more

01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,680
collaboration

01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:55,680
and more time

01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,040
people get more time now this many say

01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,400
like no they

01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:03,599
um are spending less time in computing

01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:07,119
to their um office and then they are

01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:11,119
spending more productive time uh in

01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:13,839
um in in giving um the best

01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:16,400
of them during the work so it's not like

01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:19,839
you know everybody um

01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:22,559
science has proven that everybody is not

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:23,119
able to work from nine to five or a

01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,760
defined

01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,960
time everybody has their ups and downs

01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,760
in a day

01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,799
so this has given that flexibility for

01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,760
many people to actually

01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:35,119
work in times when they are actually up

01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:39,040
and having more energy and

01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:42,160
more ideas and more thoughts so that's

01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:46,160
the strength which i've seen

01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:49,040
during the new normal and

01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,520
weaknesses of course there is a new risk

01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,680
of

01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,119
working from home even i have

01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,160
experienced that actually i started

01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,920
working

01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,520
um after putting something in the

01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,599
kitchen in the in the hob

01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,039
and then i came and started working i

01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,720
completely forgot and then

01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:06,880
the whole thing burnt completely so

01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,559
luckily nothing much happened uh just

01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,599
the food burnt

01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:13,760
uh that's the kind of risks which i'm

01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,079
talking about while working from home

01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,039
um of course there is a delicate balance

01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,599
between

01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,559
other um activities which we usually do

01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,880
at home

01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,160
and the work uh obviously you know that

01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,400
um compensate

01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,400
with the strength which i spoke before

01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,280
about more time

01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,240
and more flexibility on the way people

01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,640
work

01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,760
and next one i hear is completely

01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,520
contrary to

01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,160
uh the meta better meetings and better

01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:43,440
decision making some people feel like

01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:46,880
there is slowness or they have seen

01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,400
slow decision making um rather than it

01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,680
taking um

01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,760
you know going to someone and then

01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,799
asking um

01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:57,839
in their desk um they

01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:59,200
it takes some time for them to um keep

01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,960
in touch with them

01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,880
um and contact them i mean they're

01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,160
working from home and then

01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:08,400
take the decision um based on

01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,559
the inputs or outputs that's received

01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,400
from that person

01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,400
next one is an issue with onboarding

01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,760
which we all might have actually seen

01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:20,160
um when a new person is um

01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,079
on board into the organization during

01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,520
this challenging time

01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:28,400
um there are many issues like you know

01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:31,440
um providing them with the welcome pack

01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:34,400
um sending them uh their laptops um

01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,039
to their home and all and letting them

01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,000
actually

01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,400
log into the system um for the first

01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,119
time

01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,160
and then introduce introducing them uh

01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,480
to the entire

01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,000
organization and the i.t and the

01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,400
operations and everything

01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,920
so that is a bit of a challenge now

01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,720
probably it will be all right

01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,799
as we actually go along the new normal

01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,960
i'm gonna actually tell about that

01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:58,000
um specifically on the knowledge

01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,520
management and knowledge

01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:05,039
sharing which needs much improvement

01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:08,960
during the new normal to um

01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:11,200
facilitate such onboarding operations

01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,799
next comes the opportunities so

01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:16,319
opportunities

01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:19,760
are people felt like they have had

01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:21,200
time to stop and rationalize

01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,799
what they were actually doing you know

01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,079
maybe a project

01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,960
may be a program or investment in new

01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,319
technology

01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:33,599
or investment in um something which

01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:34,799
um they wanted to um provide as a

01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:38,160
service to others

01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:40,079
so those things um

01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,760
they actually had an opportunity to stop

01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,280
for a couple of months

01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,799
and then think about it and then

01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,039
rationalize

01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,319
so next one is tech rationalization

01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,760
again you know

01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:55,119
um this gave an opportunity

01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:57,760
for people to

01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:59,039
find out what actually works what

01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,280
actually doesn't work

01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,240
when people started to work from remote

01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,599
and

01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:09,520
they are able to identify these

01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:12,240
systems um which requires

01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,000
uh improvement uh some systems which are

01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,480
not even being used but still running

01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,559
and

01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,480
they can actually quickly uh shut it

01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,640
down um

01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,400
so these things which they found as an

01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,839
opportunity during this lockdown

01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,760
next comes learning which is very

01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:28,319
interesting because people found a lot

01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:31,680
of time actually to learn new things

01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:33,839
during the lockdown um i've seen

01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,000
many reports coming out from online

01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:38,319
learning platforms like

01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,119
people started buying more courses and

01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:41,760
then started

01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,359
actually uh going through the courses

01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,680
and i've seen many people

01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:47,039
who i spoke with some of my friends

01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,319
actually who go on actually buying

01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,720
courses during the

01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,880
time when the course comes in um 60 and

01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:55,520
70 off in udemy and then

01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,559
they completely forget that and then

01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,680
again you know it

01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:03,039
keeps um in

01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:04,480
in their inbox without even knowing that

01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,760
they bought that course

01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:10,799
so uh they found time to learn

01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,520
um and improve their skills maybe a soft

01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:14,559
skill

01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,359
or a hard skill um it skills whatever

01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,920
you call it

01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:19,920
so they find actually opportunity to

01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,960
stop and learn during this time

01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:26,799
threats are um a bit

01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,960
um harsh because um many roles actually

01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:30,839
may go or minerals actually went away

01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,680
during this

01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:37,920
um pandemic unfortunately

01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:40,079
so um basically um being positive

01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,039
hopefully everything when the new normal

01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,760
is

01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:45,839
up and running um roles will come back

01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,319
and then people start to realize like

01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,880
what

01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:49,440
they missed and then they they'll be

01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,119
able to

01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,039
bring back people in to their

01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,839
organization

01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:58,079
new projects got delayed our new project

01:06:55,839 --> 01:07:02,079
got completely shut down because of the

01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:05,359
um new normal which we have already seen

01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,480
um which resulted in a lot of

01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:10,000
recruitments being

01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:13,520
stopped and there's a huge

01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,599
cyber security threat that has come up

01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,760
because of uh the new normal when people

01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:21,599
started to work from home

01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:25,119
people tend to access their

01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:28,000
applications everything remotely um

01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,200
which probably posted premise or hosted

01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,680
in the cloud

01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,319
so there is quite a lot of opportunity

01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,359
for

01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:39,839
um cyber criminals to try and

01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:42,559
um interface with people's

01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:43,440
network and then try to steal data out

01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,760
of it

01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,039
so there's a huge cyber security threat

01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,160
that is actually

01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:52,000
come up recently so there's quite a lot

01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,559
of um

01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,240
work that need to be done on that aspect

01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:58,640
in this new normal

01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,599
a lot of investment need to be made on

01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,640
cyber security

01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,520
in the new normal next one is of course

01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,680
office parties

01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:07,680
many miss office parties i miss going

01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,799
out with my team

01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:14,480
uh of course i know um when i

01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:16,159
uh provide my service to an organization

01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,600
i usually keep my team

01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:22,560
close to my um heart and everybody

01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,600
um we had a lot of things actually

01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,000
happening around like

01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,759
you know we used to have cook and bring

01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,799
we share food

01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,920
we go out um you know once in a couple

01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,839
of weeks you know

01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,319
and you know as part of the agile

01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:39,759
process many teams

01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,839
tend to go out um um during

01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:43,600
um their retrospective and then do what

01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:45,920
their agility perspective uh

01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,440
in during a lunch time uh out in the

01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,839
restaurants that actually

01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:53,520
got completely stopped now and

01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:57,279
hopefully in the new normal

01:08:53,520 --> 01:09:00,960
we'll come back to

01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:04,000
um meeting people uh very soon

01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:06,239
so let's see about

01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,159
transformation now so we spoke about

01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:09,759
transformation in new normal we define

01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:11,120
what new normal is we're going to define

01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,920
what transformation is

01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,719
it's a bit simple transformation is just

01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,480
change

01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,960
so change if you look at in any way it's

01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,560
something

01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:24,000
really huge a change in organization

01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,799
changing the way people were changing

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,080
the people

01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:29,679
mindset how they actually um used to

01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,880
work before everything is

01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:35,600
changed now so it's

01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,880
nothing but change in people as well as

01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,560
business id

01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,239
i was specifically given like not

01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:44,000
business and i t because

01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:47,120
nowadays and of course in the future

01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
business id is same

01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,839
it's the same unit in an organization if

01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,400
something happens to business it affects

01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,239
the id

01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,840
if something happens in 90 it affects

01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:58,960
the business so

01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:02,640
they actually go together they are not

01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:06,159
um two different entities now

01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,760
so let's define the new normals on

01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:09,520
the business id what is actually going

01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,320
to happen um

01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,760
look at the i.t side of that venn

01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,400
diagram if you take

01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,120
business and as one side and ideas

01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,440
another side

01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,640
intersecting with each other i'm going

01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:24,000
to actually speak about

01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,400
the id side of it uh now um so we'll

01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,719
take

01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,520
these topics um and then i'll quickly go

01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,320
through the

01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,440
new normal on data system operations

01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,280
security audit

01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,280
knowledge sharing and i.t budget

01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,360
now let's look at the data so what we

01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,440
expect in the new normal

01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,560
on data so we expect data to be

01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,280
accessible from

01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,840
anywhere securely so that's the thing

01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,360
which

01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:53,040
we want and also data should be easy

01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:57,199
to find that is categorized curated

01:10:53,040 --> 01:11:00,800
behind certain apis securely

01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:02,880
make sure like you know um the data is

01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,400
reliable because of the curation that

01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:08,560
has happened

01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:11,520
and also anonymized and classified

01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,080
we can't actually let open the data to

01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,640
everyone

01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,480
and also in the organization which is

01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,560
spread around the world

01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,480
obviously you know you cannot export

01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,640
data from one location to another

01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:26,320
location without anonymizing

01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,640
or classifying the data so next one

01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,480
um comes the centralized part of the

01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,400
data so specifically within the legal

01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:34,159
boundaries uh we have to

01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,640
make sure it is in a central location

01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:40,080
where people will be able to

01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:42,080
uh access it from anywhere and it

01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,440
should be available all the time so

01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,719
that's the

01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,199
data side of the new normal next comes

01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,159
the

01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:51,280
system side uh which is your it

01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:54,560
applications

01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:56,560
your pass the vendor

01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,080
applications everything which we access

01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,000
as part of our

01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,199
uh business as usual and day-to-day

01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,600
activity so

01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:05,280
these should be secure and accessible

01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,719
from anywhere

01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:11,840
so you must have less downtime

01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:13,440
compared to what you have before because

01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,040
if something goes down actually that's

01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:18,320
it like you know whole

01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,320
cycle of productivity gets

01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,120
completely affected this will have more

01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:25,440
effect in the new normal compared to

01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,520
what you what we had in the office

01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,199
because if something happened when we

01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,080
were all in the same location in an

01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,560
office

01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,560
um we'll have the ability to quickly

01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,000
call up the person who's responsible for

01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,440
a particular application or the team

01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,239
who's responsible for that

01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,560
and then make them to fix it quickly and

01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,199
then

01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,480
things start to move quickly but in this

01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:47,920
time

01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:51,040
we must make sure we build the system

01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:53,679
with the

01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:55,199
key requirement that it has to go

01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,880
through less downtime it has to be

01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:59,520
resilient actually

01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,800
and the system should also be repairable

01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,080
and replaceable

01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:07,040
easily um i don't want to actually

01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,480
give away more uh on the technical side

01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,400
on what to do with this i'll come to

01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:14,400
that later on the takeaway part of

01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:18,159
this uh presentation and

01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:20,640
next comes easy to develop so basically

01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,920
you know um we used to have teams

01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,440
sitting in the office

01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:28,719
trying to develop these um uh projects

01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,760
uh and you know we all were together in

01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,880
the same place

01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:35,920
but in this new normal we should

01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,040
be in a situation where the products are

01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,600
the projects which we are actually

01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:42,159
working on are easy to develop

01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,000
from anywhere in the world anywhere

01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:45,520
which we are where we are sitting

01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,520
of course anywhere in the world actually

01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,080
races and under

01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,040
uh opens another box pandora box of

01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,880
outsourcing

01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:55,760
which i don't want to get into it and

01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:59,120
now um that's completely different

01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:02,400
way of managing compared to

01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:05,440
uh in-house development or

01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:08,960
purchasing something from a vendor

01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:11,760
so next comes the

01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,520
agility in the way which we develop

01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,360
system we want to have a jail way of

01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,800
delivering the systems

01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:20,159
and of course i want to put a point on

01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,679
cloud native

01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:26,480
in this system's

01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:27,440
new normal because cloud native make

01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,600
sure

01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,760
everything is put in the cloud nothing

01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:36,640
is dependent on anything on-premise

01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:39,120
and we'll be able to rely on the cloud

01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,440
cloud native features and we'll be able

01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,760
to develop the systems uh from anywhere

01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,480
the

01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,280
in the world or anywhere um from my from

01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,040
our home or

01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:52,080
different offices and

01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:54,719
that's that's how actually uh i expect

01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:56,239
uh the new normal to happen now and on

01:14:54,719 --> 01:15:01,120
and on

01:14:56,239 --> 01:15:01,120
the coming um months and years

01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,760
and next comes the new normal of

01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:08,159
security and audit

01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,760
so cyber security as i discussed before

01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:12,080
in the swot analysis

01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,280
is the key now it's something which need

01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,880
to be

01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:19,040
immediately looked at and immediately

01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,120
uh implemented within the organization

01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:24,480
audited within the organization

01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:26,719
and we don't want um

01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,920
to end up like any organization which

01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:31,520
went through

01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:34,480
um you know ransomwares um

01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,679
in the recent past so cyber security is

01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,480
the key

01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:40,080
new normal which need to be immediately

01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,679
addressed

01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,280
next comes the privacy engineering that

01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:48,320
privacy engineering concept is

01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:51,280
completely a large concept on its own

01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:53,199
um i just want to quickly um give give

01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,800
an idea of what privacy engineering is

01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:57,600
privacy engineering is something if you

01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:00,640
have a huge amount of data or a data set

01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:04,800
with you and if it contains

01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:08,480
any privacy data or privacy

01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,520
fields in the data privacy engineering

01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,239
make sure

01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,520
that gets anonymized that guest gets

01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:16,640
masked

01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:19,840
before you start consuming the data so

01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:23,440
this is a new um

01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:25,280
um trend righty um

01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:27,360
strategy that's coming up which is being

01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,640
used by many organizations now which are

01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,800
using big data

01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,640
privacy engineering so next comes

01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,040
identity and access management

01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,239
which is of course you know comes under

01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,600
the security

01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:42,320
or cyber security also so

01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,480
basically you know we many tend to

01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:47,679
utilize identity and access management

01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,000
which are on premise and those need to

01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:51,280
be

01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:54,480
moved into cloud

01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:57,600
and the new way of managing uh

01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,840
your devices uh your applications

01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,640
and access managements need to be

01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,520
defined

01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,640
in the new normal next one is activity

01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,239
audit so

01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,239
basically everything need to be audited

01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:11,280
and you will be in

01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:11,840
now from now on in the new normal you'll

01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,280
end up

01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:18,080
with a huge amount of activity data

01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:19,120
that need to be preserved in case

01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:22,480
something

01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:25,199
happens which is um against

01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,600
an organization's or enterprise policy

01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,120
so

01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,560
we'll be able to go back into the audit

01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,239
and we'll be able to find out what just

01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:33,120
what has actually happened so

01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,840
i expect a lot of activity audit or

01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,960
audit

01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:39,199
to happen during this new normal uh

01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,199
time

01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:45,520
so next comes a new normal of operations

01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:48,719
[Music]

01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:51,440
this actually brings in new

01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,640
practices like agile if you are not

01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,920
using agile

01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,120
devops sre a lot of new practices need

01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,400
to be

01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:02,800
incorporated into an organization um and

01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,760
should be a part of the it strategy

01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,679
actually

01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:10,320
uh so that's um the

01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,719
the new normal of operations you know

01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,520
this

01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:14,320
definitely facilitates um systems

01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,920
development

01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:19,760
in a huge uh way because um

01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,360
incorporating agile and devops uh

01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,640
definitely you know increases the

01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:25,679
productivity of

01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,120
the development teams uh systems which

01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,640
we develop

01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:33,120
and deliver everything faster

01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,679
and better than it used to before next

01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,000
comes

01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:37,199
cloud native that also comes under the

01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,320
operations

01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:41,520
where everything is um you know um i'm

01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:44,719
trying to actually define it

01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,880
in um very neutral non-technical way so

01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,560
cloud native is something where you

01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,400
everything runs from the cloud

01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,040
everything so

01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,640
operations should also be taking into

01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,880
account uh

01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,960
the cloud native aspects and should be

01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:02,239
managing the cognitive aspects

01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,880
in the new normal next comes the it

01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,440
budgeting

01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,800
so a lot of capex will now move into

01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,560
opex

01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,920
now for example you know on-premise to

01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,239
cloud and

01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,000
newer increased uh in collaboration

01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:15,440
tools and softwares

01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,960
now a lot of new license need to be

01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,239
bought because many people started to

01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:21,440
work from home

01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:23,760
uh probably like we'll have to

01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:25,520
improvise on the way we collaborate

01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,719
probably invest on some chat

01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,280
tools and softwares uh we may need to

01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,199
actually

01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,960
encounter new vendors and we need to

01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:36,080
bring them in uh

01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:38,000
for facilitating uh the new normal

01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:39,280
so that's also going to happen that's

01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,679
also has

01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:46,400
a significant um investment to be done

01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:48,000
and of course investment in cyber

01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,960
security is one of the major things

01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:54,159
which um

01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:54,159
i advocate uh during the new normal so

01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,120
let's take a look at the takeaways what

01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,480
we have discussed now i'm going to

01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:01,600
actually summarize that

01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:04,480
so data availability and data management

01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,280
are the key during a new normal you know

01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,960
anyone can

01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,480
hold any amount of data nowadays

01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,679
actually you can have a huge

01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:15,040
amount of data you're lying in your um

01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:18,480
servers or on the cloud um

01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:21,600
a lot of data sets but you

01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:24,159
should know where your data is

01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,280
and what the data actually means to you

01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:28,480
which means like you know

01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,360
you can have data catalogs um you'll be

01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,920
able to

01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,880
have data lakes actually api is in front

01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,239
of those

01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:40,000
and data to access the data securely

01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:41,840
and so the the crux here is no data in

01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,639
your finger picking fingerprint who

01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,280
has data in their fingerprint is that is

01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,960
the king

01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,880
so we have seen in the recent

01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:51,600
announcement from the oxford

01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:53,280
um vaccine trial they said like no they

01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,000
have done the work which is supposed to

01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:57,120
be

01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:01,120
done in five years

01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:04,320
in six months time so this i believe

01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:08,080
is possible because of

01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:11,120
the big data and the data management

01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,679
and data availability with the research

01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:16,159
team

01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:18,480
which researched on kovit 19.

01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:20,480
next is survivable depends on how quick

01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:23,120
we are up to the change so

01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:24,719
this is not an option now we have to

01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,880
actually do these changes within the

01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:30,080
organization bring in these changes

01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:33,280
how responsive i t you know

01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:36,159
doesn't being reactive to these changes

01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,560
um so not only actually to the changes

01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,639
of

01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,600
because of new normal but also the

01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:42,960
business changes

01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:46,400
that um is the result of

01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:49,360
the new normal um next is

01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:51,760
systems should be responsive quickly

01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:54,560
replaceable and repairable

01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:57,280
um either in parts or whole so there are

01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:59,199
so many other id strategies rit

01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,960
technologies actually we need to bring

01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,159
into the organization if we are not

01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,440
doing it before

01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:08,560
like micro services apis messaging

01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:10,960
cloud native sas pass so

01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,400
this actually will help us to be

01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,560
responsive

01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,960
um and make sure like the systems are

01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,440
quickly repairable and replaceable

01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,400
next is the knowledge sharing this is

01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:23,440
the most

01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:26,639
important part of the

01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:29,840
um new normal uh which

01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:31,360
we'll be uh doing we should be doing

01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,360
so knowledge sharing or knowledge

01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,800
management um

01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:37,120
should be nurtured within the

01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,360
organization and

01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,480
more investment need to be done on this

01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,920
aspect because

01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,159
everybody is working from different

01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:47,679
locations and everybody is actually

01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:49,760
uh doing work a different time and

01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,840
when with knowledge being at a

01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:55,679
centralized location

01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:58,960
and managed properly will have

01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:01,600
a same language spoken between

01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,560
on different teams within the

01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,920
organization

01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:07,199
and same understanding and knowledge

01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,320
being obtained or

01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:12,719
exchanged between teams so this is one

01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:16,159
of the important takeaways

01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,639
on the new normal um next one is you

01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:19,280
know

01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:20,400
stronger i.t roadmap and strategy that

01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,800
need to be done

01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,920
based on these takeaways for the next

01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,960
six months uh

01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,560
to probably know three year time um i

01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,840
would say like starts with six months

01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,120
and then we'll

01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:36,480
go ahead and then create one

01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,840
uh one for the longer duration

01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:41,120
so something need to be done for the

01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:44,560
next six months and strong i.t roadmap

01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:47,679
um and strategy need to be deviced

01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:50,800
for the new normal um

01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:53,040
another thing is investing in the future

01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,080
um of course definitely on cyber

01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,040
security

01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:59,120
you know and data science um machine

01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:02,639
learning and artificial intelligence

01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:03,360
um are the future so more investment

01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:06,800
need to be done

01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,199
on these sites um you may ask like what

01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,520
is

01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:12,320
the takeaway on this for the new normal

01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,800
uh no i mean data science or

01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,360
machine learning um there are many use

01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,800
cases

01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:19,040
which i can actually cite probably i

01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,719
don't have time now uh we can discuss it

01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:23,920
later if somebody wants

01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:25,840
uh do actually um let me know i'll be

01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:29,440
happy to actually discuss on

01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:32,480
um those topics

01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:35,120
um of course you know change management

01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,719
uh has to happen um you have to have a

01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,880
really strict instringent

01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,840
and definite change management that need

01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,960
to be

01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:46,800
uh happening during this uh new normal

01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:49,600
now specifically on eliminating fears

01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,159
and acceptance of the new normal um i

01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,920
have

01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:56,960
a big advocate of mental health

01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:59,920
for people so you know

01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,480
i do not actually want to manage only

01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,960
the i.t

01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,920
but also you know i want to manage uh

01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,960
people's

01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,760
um mental health and support their

01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,520
mental health

01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:14,560
uh in during my um

01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,639
service in any organization so those

01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,719
things need to be taken care uh you know

01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:21,760
even more rigorously

01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:23,440
in this new normal um of course

01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,080
culturally evaluation you know the way

01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:27,120
we

01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,719
used to use used to work before we got

01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,639
used to

01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,719
um doing certain things that has

01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:35,600
completely changed now so

01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:37,520
um new people you know we have to

01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:40,719
unlearn a lot of things actually

01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:42,560
and we have to actually be transparent

01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:44,239
uh otherwise things are not going to

01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,199
work um when people are working from a

01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:48,159
part

01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:49,760
and lot of um changes can happen in the

01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:53,040
software development life cycle

01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:56,159
in your it organization um

01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:59,520
realigning uh your

01:25:56,159 --> 01:26:01,360
business strategies um or it's i.t

01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,400
strategies uh to the business and the

01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:05,600
other way around

01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:08,880
so so many um re-evaluation need to be

01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:12,480
happening during this time next one is

01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:14,960
innovate so that's what i would um um

01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,480
recommend as a last point here and an

01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,920
important point so which

01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:22,719
i always nurture in my

01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,920
work is innovation so things like you

01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,600
know gamification

01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,679
hackathons you know knowledge sharing

01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,320
the new ways of knowledge sharing

01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,960
so these things need to be there as part

01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,840
of the

01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,800
new normal within an organization so

01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:38,400
probably like

01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:41,199
um i believe i've not touched

01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:43,280
a lot of deep itn technology side and

01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:46,560
then try to keep myself

01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:50,000
uh to more generic terminologies

01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:53,920
so hopefully everyone actually enjoyed

01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:56,159
this presentation thank you very much

01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,760
for giving this opportunity to speak

01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:05,840
with you all

01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:05,840
thank you again bye

01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:12,320
okay great fantastic presentation thank

01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:16,080
you venkat

01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:17,360
that was excellent um so if anybody has

01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,639
any questions from the audience please

01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:21,679
just leave them in the comments

01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:24,560
and we'll relay those over stephen

01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,560
do you have any questions

01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:30,000
presentation just to start with the new

01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,000
normal do you see

01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,040
more companies now permanently moving

01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,159
towards a

01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:39,120
fully remote way of working right

01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:40,000
so we were actually talking before uh

01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,719
this and

01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,760
about uh what's happening to the new

01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:46,000
normal so

01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,600
a couple of days back i had an article

01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,280
in

01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,440
wall street journal where they were

01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,239
telling like one of the biggest issues

01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:55,520
they are facing

01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:56,719
with the working from home is innovation

01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,120
is going down

01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,880
a lot so people are not innovating

01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,320
companies are not innovating because

01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:05,040
their people are not able to see each

01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:07,840
other face to face so

01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:08,960
i don't think on a long term uh

01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,239
companies are

01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:14,320
going to go for um home based working

01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:17,040
but they'll have a mixer kind of

01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:18,400
uh working like no couple of days home

01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,199
on couple of days

01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:22,719
in office and then slowly they'll try to

01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:23,760
transition you know we have we don't

01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:27,120
know about this

01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,800
new um virus actually yet

01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,480
so we are still studying it we are still

01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:33,440
trying to find out what it is

01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,920
uh so the more we know about it that's

01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,840
when

01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,280
i would feel like the companies will

01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,760
take the direction

01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,960
based on that so as of now i could see

01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,280
like you know

01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,480
i think google announced um yesterday a

01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:47,520
day before that

01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:50,880
all the staff will be working from home

01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:54,320
till mid of next year so

01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,000
uh and also uh i think siemens uh also

01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,520
has changed their policy of working from

01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,600
home like uh

01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,800
giving more flexibility to their workers

01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,360
beyond

01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,560
next year so basically like it really

01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,239
depends on

01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,840
the company's culture what the company

01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:10,000
is actually doing

01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,960
so that's that's where i could see uh

01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,719
happening in the next

01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:18,080
six months to one year time yeah

01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:19,679
all right thank you so

01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:22,400
another question i had is based on your

01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,480
your swot analysis actually you um

01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,840
in the streams you had say more

01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,600
collaboration

01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:29,520
and then as a weakness it was slow

01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:31,679
decision making

01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,760
so do you see do you see if there's

01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:37,040
anything that can be done to improve

01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,040
that decision-making

01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:41,840
um well we have to actually take a look

01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,159
at how we

01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,440
did the decision making before we went

01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:48,560
into lockdown so

01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:52,080
basically we i've seen personally like

01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:54,639
we go on doing so many number of uh

01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:56,080
meetings with different number of people

01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:59,280
different number of vendors

01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:00,719
and everyone trying to bring everyone

01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:03,760
into the same room

01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:07,760
is a bit of difficult uh on

01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:10,960
on a person's side so

01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:13,679
that was an issue when we had

01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,560
a lot of meetings happening even before

01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:16,400
uh the

01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,320
the lockdown started after the lockdown

01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:22,000
what actually i could see was

01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:25,199
uh people started to um realize

01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,760
like okay their importance in

01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:29,040
an organization they started becoming

01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:32,800
self-aware

01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:36,239
of their uh roles and then they

01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,480
they're actually quick to respond uh for

01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:39,440
any questions or issues that come on

01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,360
their way

01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:43,520
and then they're trying to actually uh

01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:45,600
everything starts to move quicker

01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,920
uh because we we have this feeling like

01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,360
you know if we start to work from home

01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,260
something else will come and then we'll

01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,679
be

01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,760
[Music]

01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,920
distracted from our work and also we

01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:58,560
tend to actually focus more on work

01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,199
psychologically during that time so we

01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,400
tend to

01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:05,040
do more work during the work from home

01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,080
duration compared to the work which we

01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:09,840
do

01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,840
in office space

01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,280
okay thank you

01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,719
i think we uh we have one question in

01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:19,679
the comments uh

01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:20,960
from none other than duncan uh he says

01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:23,600
uh how do you think

01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,520
the agile way the agile way of working

01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,760
applies to remote development teams can

01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,800
it

01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:30,480
still be truly applied all right

01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,120
so this is a bit of a challenge actually

01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:35,280
so in general

01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:37,040
uh generally speaking about agile way of

01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:40,080
working what happens is like

01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:42,239
you tend to break down

01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,199
your large piece of work into smaller

01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:45,600
piece of work

01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:46,880
and then you tend to distribute that

01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,159
within your teams

01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,000
and the teams will actually take it up

01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,880
and then break it down again and then

01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,560
distribute it

01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,159
among themselves and then try to do the

01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:57,679
work now

01:31:54,159 --> 01:32:00,400
in case of um before

01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:03,199
lockdown scenarios if there were any

01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:05,360
issues or any questions or anything

01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:06,320
it actually comes up quite quickly from

01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:09,600
different teams

01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:12,000
and then goes into the uh uh the person

01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:15,280
who actually gave the requirement

01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,320
but after people went into lockdown i've

01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,199
seen like

01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:21,440
um a lot of people struggled initially

01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:24,159
and then later they realized

01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:25,360
they'll have to provide a proper

01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:29,120
requirement you know

01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:29,120
they have to kind of uh give

01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,440
end-to-end kind of requirement to finish

01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,280
off certain

01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:37,280
tasks and then that gets actually

01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:39,040
executed if there is any change comes

01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,800
they'll come back again and then do the

01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,360
change after that in the next print and

01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,280
all

01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,880
so basically that's how actually people

01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:48,000
started to i would say

01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,400
evolve after the lockdown so

01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,280
i'm i'll i'm thinking of actually i

01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,159
think

01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,639
it's going to happen more we'll start to

01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:58,159
evolve

01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:59,280
more uh during this period at home

01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,880
working from home

01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:03,360
in different locations and we'll be

01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:06,239
evolving a lot on and finding

01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:07,520
a new ways actually of uh working

01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:09,120
efficiently

01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,800
at this time so that's what i'm

01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:15,760
expecting to happen in the next

01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:15,760
six months time during this period

01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,320
um great well i think that's all the

01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:25,840
