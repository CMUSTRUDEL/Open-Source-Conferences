What its like to be a technology leader in a HealthTech environment, which couldn't come at a better time, considering the whole industry is under a real spotlight.

Stephen Sitton, Senior Manager of Engineering for Medidata Solutions
"Building a Tech Culture at Medidata"

A tech culture can be hard to define and even harder to build. In this talk, Stephen Sitton covers some of the approaches used to build a tech culture at Medidata. These include a common mission, core principles, and other initiatives to encourage making decisions and learning together.

my name is steve sitton and i'm a senior

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,720
engineering manager at medidata

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,679
and my talk is covering building a tech

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,400
culture at many data

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,720
so firstly just a bit about me so i've

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
been working in the tech industry for

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,080
over 20 years now and started off as a

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,840
developer

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,000
gradually worked my way up to leading

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,720
teams and i've been

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,320
managing teams now for for over seven

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,240
years

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,920
i've been at many data now for two and a

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,960
half years doing

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,040
doing that leading teams there

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,040
if you're interested in finding me on

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,360
twitter my handle is steve sitting

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,120
for those who maybe don't know much

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,840
about metadata

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,280
metadata solutions help shorten the time

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,160
to start and complete

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,680
clinical trials and bring drugs to

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,000
market faster

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,160
this means millions of patients can see

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,920
the benefits of medical research

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,600
faster so we are basically a global

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,400
company working throughout the whole

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,280
clinical trial process

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
so we have a an office in london which

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
is based in hammersmith

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
obviously we all working remote now with

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,960
the

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,080
current situation but we have 10

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,520
engineering teams

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,280
based there along with that we also have

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,040
remote teams based in india with a

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,799
vendor

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
roughly about the same amount same

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,840
number

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,439
and they they pair up with the teams

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,280
that we have we have in the uk

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,159
uh we have a software as a service

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,840
platform that is completely on the cloud

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,479
and our tech stack is primarily scala

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,079
apis we do have some java services some

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,200
java tooling

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,920
as well as our ui is based on react and

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
node.js

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,119
so doing a talk on building a tech

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,360
culture it's

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,799
it's important to maybe try and

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,799
understand what culture is

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,520
because it's difficult to to pin down

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,720
the definition because culture means

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,440
different things to

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,440
different people

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,040
now one of the most probably popular

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,800
quotes around culture is culture eats

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,239
strategy for breakfast which is

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,840
accredited to

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,319
to peter drunker and this is true

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
because no matter how good your strategy

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,319
is

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,519
there's a human factor to how

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:41,040
successful your your projects will be

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,000
and you can search online for you know

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,720
definitions about culture but one that's

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
always

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,879
stuck me is your culture

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
is every decision you make i heard this

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,360
on a talk

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,519
some time ago unfortunately i can't

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,840
remember who by

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,599
but it stuck with me because because i

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,480
really believe that it's true that

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,760
your culture is basically driven by

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,159
every person

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,519
in your organization in your tech teams

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,680
and by the decisions that they make

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,360
it's not something that can be pushed

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,599
down from the top and

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,040
no matter how many posters you put

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,800
around the office or

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,560
colorful bean bags there are lying

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,000
around that that doesn't give you your

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,560
culture

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,480
it's the people that do that and i i

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,599
believe that it's

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,799
the responsibility of all of the

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:36,720
managers the leadership to provide an

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:40,319
environment where your culture can grow

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,400
so i'm going to go through what kind of

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,599
forms the basis for our culture at

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,360
metadata

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,159
and how our tech culture grows on top of

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,480
that

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,720
but i'll also be providing just say

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,519
personal opinions around some leadership

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,159
and management that apply to that that

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,159
are related

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,519
so an essential part of building any

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,159
culture is to have a

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,280
a mission something that that people

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,519
believe that they

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,239
they can be part of at many data we're

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
united around a single goal that

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,759
together we power

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,720
smarter treatments and healthier people

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,759
this means that at medi-data we're more

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,600
than just a

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:31,199
technology company we we believe we're

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,199
building an architecture of hope

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,520
and this is a powerful mission because

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,440
it's changing people's lives for the

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,919
better

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,080
it's even more crucial now in the the

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,720
current pandemic that we're in

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,360
and the everyone at medidata is part of

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
this

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,120
this mission every day

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,320
i mean metadata our tech teams are no

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,600
different to other

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,520
other tech teams we're we're busy there

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,360
can be pressure on we're delivering

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,360
features and supporting our customers

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,160
so i believe that it's it's important to

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:12,320
to remind everyone remind the teams

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,880
about what our mission is so that

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,520
when the days are hard when we are let's

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,440
say bogged down in all of our work

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,960
we need to see what that what that value

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,360
of that work is all about

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,919
and look at our mission to see what that

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,479
is delivering because that provides

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,320
an extra focus and extra energy into

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,720
what we're doing

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,960
because of the impact that our work can

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
have

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,000
so i believe that this mission is let's

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,080
say the the base layer to

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,039
to our culture it's a common purpose

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,560
throughout

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,560
which which we build upon

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,720
so next many data we have

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,400
say core principles but i would say that

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,360
one of the core values

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,800
of many data is that of caring and you

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
can see that in

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,960
the five founding principles that there

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,600
is a metadata

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,039
which is diversity and belonging

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
sustainability

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,759
employee wellness volunteering and

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,280
philanthropy

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,160
now medidata is a mission-driven company

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,240
that

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,639
sees the diversity of its employees as a

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,840
tremendous asset

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,800
and the values creating a sense of

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,800
belonging throughout the company so not

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,240
only does many data care

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,759
about its employees but it also don't

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,160
cares about the environment around us

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,800
one example of this can be seen in a

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,840
project where medidata uk

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,880
partnered with the hammersmith business

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,880
improvement district to work on a pilot

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:57,520
program where to improve the

00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:01,039
the green space and the air quality um

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,520
in the area and this resulted in some

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,160
apartments being created pretty much

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,319
directly outside of our office so the

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,000
the public and the community can use

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,599
these as well as

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,280
people at medidata can see that this is

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,360
something

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,800
that the company has been part of that

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,880
they want to change and help the

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,479
community

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,039
but they're also throughout the company

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,280
there are volunteering opportunities and

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,240
programs where employees can give back

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,680
to the community as well

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,800
so this is just a quick overview but it

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,840
it helps to show

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,319
the aspects of metadata um

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,680
how it is a caring organization it cares

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,000
for customers

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,599
it's for employees cares for patients

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,840
and it cares for the environment around

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,840
us

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,840
i wanted to share this because i believe

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,560
that it's important because it

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,160
it's basically in medi-data's dna it

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,960
really is what metadata is

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,879
is all about and this is what um

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,360
what our employees what our teams are

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,520
all part of

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,680
so we have we have these principles but

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,199
then many data strives for

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,240
three things as part of its culture

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:22,160
which are openness

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,160
collaboration and fun

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,599
so looking at our now looking at our

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,680
tech culture

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,199
we can build on top of these build on

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,320
top of the openness collaboration and

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
fun within our teams

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,159
i do see that openness openness is

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,719
important

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,399
in any tech teams because ultimately you

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,760
want people to be themselves at work

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,040
for this to happen we need to create an

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,160
environment that

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,120
ultimately fosters psychological safety

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,399
so that people can be themselves and

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,360
feel that they're in their safe

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,040
environment within their teams

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,800
now there are many talks on

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,080
psychological safety and the aspects

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,200
around that but i

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,360
i believe that it's the um engineering

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,519
manager's responsibility to ensure that

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,279
their teams are a safe place

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,200
um for people for people to express

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,680
their opinions to express their feelings

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,760
and this doesn't come for free

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,600
it takes effort and i believe some

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
areas to do this are building

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
relationships

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,959
ultimately this is down to building

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,360
trust within the teams

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,200
this can be this can be done through

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,880
regular one-to-ones

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
but it's about getting to know the

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,720
people in your team

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
know what's important to them know about

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,680
their families remembering their

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,440
their birthdays sometimes it's it's the

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
simplest of things that makes a big

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,360
difference

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,040
to a person but it it helps them

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
feel more comfortable let's say feel

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,839
themselves and

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,399
once you get that they can be more open

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,120
and then it's about being role models

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,920
and

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,959
i i really really believe that

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,200
particularly as

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,560
managers we should be role models to

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,959
others so

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,800
we we're asking our teams to do certain

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,640
things yeah if we go and do the opposite

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
that's not setting a great example and

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,200
it won't

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,640
certainly lead to other people wanting

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,279
to

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,720
to do the same thing but it's also about

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,399
people within the teams being role

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,680
models for each other

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,920
so that we can um so it's how we react

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,600
to mistakes and how open we are to other

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,560
people's ideas

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
all of this is about being an example to

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,880
others

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,920
but it helps all leads to that openness

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,440
and then actively listening i

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,399
i mean we can all be very good at

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,240
talking but actively listening

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,600
ultimately is a skill and it's certainly

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,519
something that i'm working on

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,279
but it shows that you care it shows you

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
care about

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,000
you know who's talking to you care about

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,320
what they're saying and you want to

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,680
learn more about it and then that helps

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,839
that person feel

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,839
more comfortable as well feel valued

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,519
and then giving feedback is is an

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
important part of building any culture

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,240
both positive

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,880
and constructive whether it's

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,000
at a team level through retrospectives

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,920
or even in one to ones

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,680
feedback shows that you you care about

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,040
someone you want to give them

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,120
positive feedback to encourage um

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
encourage what they're doing but also

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,800
constructive to help them

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,320
in any areas that they're looking to

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,920
work on any areas that may need

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,640
development but ultimately it shows that

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,720
you care

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,320
now i believe that these uh these are

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,399
key areas that that help

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,959
people feel safe in themselves

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,399
at work and ultimately provide an

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,839
opportunity for

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
for a culture of openness

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,079
now moving on to collaboration

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,920
you know collaboration is important

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,440
particularly when you have distributed

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,519
teams

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,200
and although autonomy is important to us

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,030
we want to have we want to make sure

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,440
that we're learning from each other

00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,720
[Music]

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,440
constantly now i put this i put

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,600
collaboration

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,600
into different areas so first of all

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,360
like leadership collaboration

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
i see this is it's kind of one of the

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,000
the most important areas because

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,760
having partnerships with your peers in

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,240
the organization is essential for

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,800
improving and helping your teams but

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,920
also

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,760
making your workplace better we have

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,959
obviously the usual slack channels where

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,800
we can

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,639
update people and ask questions this is

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,399
good

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,160
but we also wanted something that can

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,959
help the collaboration and learn from

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,040
each other

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,959
and this led to having what we've called

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,440
a leadership forum

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,320
so this is every month we is in the

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
leaders

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,760
managers the directors would get

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,240
together and

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,760
just have open discussions around what's

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,639
important to our teams

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,320
all the topics are driven by us within

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,639
the teams

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,480
um so that basically we're raising and

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,399
discussing

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,800
anything that's that's kind of important

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,079
to us so that we can make improvements

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,920
and see how other teams are working

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,760
i would say that the the picture you see

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,680
on the slides isn't isn't a leadership

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,079
forum in action this was a

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,399
this was a social just where we're we're

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,160
building relationships but

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,680
but that's another key part of this that

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,519
i've really enjoyed is

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,199
it's helped us build relationships with

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,880
other managers so i've got to know some

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,440
of the managers

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,399
through this that maybe i wouldn't have

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,519
normally

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,839
just in the office environment but this

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,720
leadership forum has really helped us

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,680
improve on areas within our tech culture

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,880
um

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,440
so that we've we've learned

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,000
um how other teams operate now that's

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,399
not to say

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,839
that we want our team to to work exactly

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,480
the same

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,079
but we can't find common patterns we can

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,880
find good things within teams that we

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,880
may want to

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,120
put into others but it's also around

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,760
maybe like initiatives we've improved

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,199
our hiring process

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,120
we've learned to how best or how

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,880
we can improve certain adopting certain

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,519
practices like devops

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,120
this is still in progress but we can

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
discuss at this level ways

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
things that are working as part of that

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
and things that may need improvement but

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,959
we discuss and we collaborate together

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:44,320
to do that so

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,760
the next one is is team collaboration

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,959
now even before lockdown collaboration

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,800
is important across our teams and

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,880
because we've got different teams across

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,040
different time zones

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,800
so the communication and that

00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
collaboration has been essential for our

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,839
culture

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,560
and obviously we have our slackdown

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,120
channels across the teams

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,880
and video chats that's all important for

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,880
for building our culture but

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,320
what we wanted to to do is to try and

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,639
avoid some of the

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,360
silos within our teams and find ways

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,320
that

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,279
that we can share knowledge across them

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,199
so we

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,360
we started an initiative to help break

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,800
down some of these silos some

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,240
the initiative is called meditech

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,639
so we see this as say a mini conference

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,399
or a get together of all of the

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,720
the engineering teams to share

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,480
what what work they're working on or

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,000
what's important that could be relevant

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,920
to other people

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,880
so every month we have two or three

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,399
talks that can be anything about what

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,600
the team is doing or what they think

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,440
another team might

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,959
might find valuable so um

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,199
over the course of how long it's been

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,920
running we've had 31 talks and

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,000
32 speakers and eight different hosts so

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,560
what this provides us is an opportunity

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,160
not only for sharing knowledge but for

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,360
people in the team to practice

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,759
their public speaking um or even hosting

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,639
an event

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,440
but i i believe that this meditech has

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,759
has been a

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:24,240
real big part of our tech culture um

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,000
it's just great to see how how people

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,160
have been building relationships based

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,040
on a talk people have been wanting to

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,720
chat discuss work with each other on the

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,519
ideas that they've heard so that they

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,920
can

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,800
um learn more about it or see how that

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,839
it it can apply to them

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,079
but also this meditek has grown um

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,519
to different countries we've had um

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,959
japan have been having their own

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,839
meditechs

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,759
but also um other countries have joined

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,360
our many tech so we've had speakers from

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,759
japan or the us

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,440
from their engineering teams that have

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,959
have come and shared information that

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
could be relevant for us

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,040
so it really has built on this culture

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,480
of collaboration

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,600
not only within london but across

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,600
the tech organization

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,720
and then as well as team there is just

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,199
individual collaboration as well this is

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,880
where

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,319
obviously as managers we can work with

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,919
individuals on

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:27,679
on anything that um that

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,440
could be important to work on skills or

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,480
anything that needs

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,240
neat areas of development but also pair

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,919
programming as well that's important for

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,080
individuals to work and collaborate

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,880
together

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
so i really believe i've enjoyed all of

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,880
this

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,120
this collaboration all of the leadership

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,400
the team and individually

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,679
because it's really built on medidata's

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,880
core principle

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,720
of belonging where we've been

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,720
collaborating across all these different

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,080
levels

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,640
and then we move on to fun now

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,360
you know the teams are they work hard

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,120
and

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,120
and they are under pressure at certain

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,320
times so it's important that we

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,640
we can have fun along the way

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,520
and having fun is a key part of our

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,559
culture

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,880
and we do this in a variety of ways

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:27,440
we do have regular hackathons

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,160
where teams can groups of people can

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,640
work together

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,400
to obviously achieve um whatever the

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,760
project is

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:39,520
we have team meals and drinks

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,080
we have sports events now

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,039
admittedly some of you you may not see a

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,600
sports event is

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,760
is much fun but but there is also a

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,919
social aspect to all of this where

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,880
people who may may not be wanting to run

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,520
but they enjoy

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,799
joining just for the social social

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,080
interaction

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,919
but then throughout the year there's

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,880
also many other

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,799
social events whether it's the office as

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,400
a whole or just the tech teams

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,960
just about working just about being with

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,840
the team and having fun

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,679
but obviously um there's now we're all

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
in lockdown it's important to maintain

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,600
that

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,520
because to try and avoid um

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,120
situations where anyone is feeling

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,720
isolated or lonely

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,960
it's important to maintain

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,799
maintain those con the connections that

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,200
we have in our teams which is hard when

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,320
we are

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,000
all fully remote so again this this

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
takes effort but it's we've been doing

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,720
this through

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:42,320
remote drinks where online games and

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,640
team events but but what we've seen is

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,120
it's

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,960
good to see the teams you know working

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,520
together having a bit of fun even

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,679
through obviously the situation we're

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,440
all in now where we are all

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:58,880
working remotely but all of this

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,919
all this these um events and all these

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,080
opportunities

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,400
just keeps the moment away from the work

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,320
or the challenges we have just to

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,760
just to have fun with some of the

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,760
friends that we have in the office

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,640
so i

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
so i see see all of that as all part of

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,440
our

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,240
our culture and building our culture but

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,880
it is a journey and it's

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,000
it's a journey that i never i never

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,240
really believe that we

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,559
will get to you will never get to an end

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,159
or you'll never be finished

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,280
i think that one thing you can be sure

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,919
of is that the change is guaranteed

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,159
organizations evolve people change the

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,400
environment around us

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,320
can be unpredictable as we're very much

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,280
seeing at the moment

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,480
so a sense of a healthy culture is one

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,559
that gets stronger

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,799
and this is what we see at many data in

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,240
our teams that

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,799
that what we've seen around us we

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,400
we are we work together we work with

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,480
each other

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,640
through challenges through different

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,480
circumstances this is where we

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,720
we help each other out we look out for

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,159
each other and we grow stronger through

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,159
that as a united team

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,440
and the uh you know ultimately that we

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,799
can change

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,159
adapt to change together obviously we've

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,919
had a big change

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,200
with lockdown and ultimately when we

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,039
look at our engineering teams

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,720
although it's a big change of all going

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,159
fully remote this is actually had

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,360
minimal impact

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,080
on our productivity now ultimately you

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,080
can say that

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
no no commuting has had an impact on

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,000
that and that's true

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,559
but it's also the mindset and the

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,200
attitudes of the people in the teams

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,000
who have continued wanting to to work

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,559
together they've known that our mission

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,600
um and what we what we're delivering to

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,120
our customers

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,640
and that's helped us to adapt to changes

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,640
and the big changes that we're seeing

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,760
around us and obviously keep that

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,640
culture that we

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,679
that we have at many data but also it's

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,400
more than

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,919
kind of adapting to changes around us in

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,640
the environment that are unpredictable

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,240
but it's also

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,480
bringing in new changes within an

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,120
organization maybe new practices

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,559
i mentioned earlier around devops now

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,840
ultimately this can be a big change for

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,679
people in the organization it's

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,880
different ways of doing things

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,280
but this again is where our culture

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,280
is a strength because this is where we

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,600
work together we're open

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,960
um around maybe some of the difficulties

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
we're having around this some of the

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,240
things we're not quite

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,240
sure about when we're collaborating

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,559
together we're working together

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:47,039
to gradually get get to a better place

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,520
with with any new practices or any new

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,440
changes to come in this is all a sign of

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,360
the healthy culture the strong culture

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,320
that we have at medidata

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,320
so to summarize

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,640
our tech culture is built on our

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,120
powerful mission

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,640
our core principles which has a strong

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,679
sense of caring

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,799
as well as striving for an environment

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,919
of openness

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,200
collaboration and fun

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,880
and this enables us to to nurture our

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,280
strongest talent

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
the people because ultimately we want

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,039
people who

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,520
want our our teams to be who they want

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,640
to

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,640
be to be themselves and ultimately have

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,240
an opportunity to be where they want to

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,600
be

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,000
um and we believe that we we can give

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,600
the people

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,480
a safety um and the environment for them

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,679
to do that

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,799
within many data and i believe that all

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,120
of this

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:52,320
um all this has helped metadata become

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,400
one of the best places to work with um

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,960
voted for this year is a great place to

00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,559
work we voted number 18 in a

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,279
in the large company category

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,240
so i i really do believe that it is

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,840
every decision

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,720
that that defines our culture

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,240
and that metadata we are we are building

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,240
a culture

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,600
we are building our technology it is a

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,840
journey

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,080
but we are working

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,520
we're working together making decisions

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,880
to help us

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,880
improve and be better

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,640
