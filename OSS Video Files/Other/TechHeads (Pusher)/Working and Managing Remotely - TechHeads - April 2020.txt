Title: Working and Managing Remotely - TechHeads - April 2020
Publication date: 2020-05-18
Playlist: TechHeads
Description: 
	Chris Dalzell from Maguire Training brings us an online session on working and managing teams remotely.

There will be a lot of companies in Tech in particular who are set up for this very well in principal but we want to try and help people put that into practice effectively and make the most of the current situation.

The good news is that leading remote teams is just like leading any other team. The bad news is that if you’re used to managing by watching what people are doing, there will need to be a shift in mindset for you and your team.

Key points
 Never worked remotely before? key points to doing it successfully
 Learning to let go - communication is key
 The importance of explicit Communication Agreements
 Direction -not intrusive supervision
 Time to start narrating your work.
 Technology: ideal for both formal and informal communication
 Provide training/support
 Work – Life integration and separation
