Title: Working and Managing Remotely - TechHeads - April 2020
Publication date: 2020-05-18
Playlist: TechHeads
Description: 
	Chris Dalzell from Maguire Training brings us an online session on working and managing teams remotely.

There will be a lot of companies in Tech in particular who are set up for this very well in principal but we want to try and help people put that into practice effectively and make the most of the current situation.

The good news is that leading remote teams is just like leading any other team. The bad news is that if you’re used to managing by watching what people are doing, there will need to be a shift in mindset for you and your team.

Key points
 Never worked remotely before? key points to doing it successfully
 Learning to let go - communication is key
 The importance of explicit Communication Agreements
 Direction -not intrusive supervision
 Time to start narrating your work.
 Technology: ideal for both formal and informal communication
 Provide training/support
 Work – Life integration and separation

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
so I'm working from home us the rest of

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,089
us aren't underworld is moved on its

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,880
axis in the last couple of weeks and

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,349
people haven't changed but our processes

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,440
have so that's really what I'm going to

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,890
take you through for the next 30 minutes

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,680
I was part of McGuire training I manage

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,990
a team of 40 remote trainers I'm

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,750
probably a couple of weeks ago this

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,580
session would have been about flexible

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,199
working about working from home now

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,170
we're all working from home so the

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,850
landscape has changed considerably so

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,489
that's what we're going to talk about

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,280
during the next thirty minutes okay

00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:41,920
so good news is it's managing a team

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,680
from from that work from home isn't

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,809
actually much different but it depends

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,120
really on your approach when people were

00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:51,460
in the office and the way you manage

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,690
them so we might need to change your

00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,570
mindset and change some of your

00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,149
approaches and your processes to get the

00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,729
best out of of the people the situation

00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:02,890
we are in completely uncharted territory

00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:04,750
here two weeks in no one really knows

00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,060
what good looks like we'll really know

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,390
what it should and we have very few

00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,039
thing frames of reference so we are in

00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,710
this together both in keeping our heads

00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:16,300
being sensible and realizing that people

00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:20,050
haven't changed they're still the same

00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,250
team members is important to hang on to

00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:26,180
as we go forward

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,970
okay so the aims of the session is to

00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,730
look at how organizations managers and

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:35,090
your teams can really try to navigate

00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:37,540
what is just unprecedented business

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,100
disruption there's no two ways about it

00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,590
we all want to come out of this with

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,140
healthy businesses and also healthy

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,720
people a healthy good business practice

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,790
as well I personally believe that the

00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,350
world will look a different place and I

00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,340
hope there are some really positive

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:58,070
learnings to our approach to the way we

00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,450
manage our businesses as well so let's

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,500
see let's go on this journey it's

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,300
exciting it's at the moment week two I

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,190
don't know I'll be still in the Ottoman

00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,500
period but there's still a lot and other

00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,140
gaits and a lot of things do to take

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,380
restraint we have supported the session

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,330
with some companies and slides and

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:23,209
information and a resource pack as well

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:25,730
which Alex will distribute to you so the

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:29,209
topics for discussion communication

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,910
communication is key it will always will

00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:34,310
be in whatever situation we're in it's

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,769
the thing that if anybody asks about

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,019
people management is they'll always say

00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,450
they never communicated enough so

00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,820
important and really vital in this

00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,220
situation it's not you know out of sight

00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,830
out of mind we need to take different

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,930
approaches to communicate communicate to

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:55,519
people and make sure they're feeling

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:57,500
included as well okay direction so we

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,299
don't want to micromanage people but we

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,760
do need to have some levels of

00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:03,620
supervision we need to know projects are

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,720
going forward we need to know we're

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,310
progressing we need to know tasks are

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,950
being done on a daily basis whether

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,580
that's maintenance whether it's client

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,310
facing

00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,530
actions are required all of these things

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,450
need to go on so we will need to find

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,720
some methods about how we do that so

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,640
we'll talk about a bit more detail

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,680
technology I'm only going to touch on

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,540
this really from it looks sort of quite

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,670
a soft way I'll leave that to you guys

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,530
you're probably on that already but

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,750
there are there are some successes and

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,670
some not and from people management

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,560
point of view just like to allude from

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,569
its and that word

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,220
you okay motivating your team so what

00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:44,530
I'm working on those that you knew your

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,450
team before this happened so now how do

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,970
we get continue to get the best out of

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:52,360
them what do we know about them what can

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,370
we really help them with what we can do

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,130
to support them and their families or

00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,130
lone workers whatever that is how can we

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,739
make that work providing training so

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:06,310
we'll talk about that in detail in terms

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:10,959
of using it as really useful times work

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,920
to upscale so again got some information

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,110
around there

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,090
also what explicit and implicit

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,549
communication could not like so simply

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,859
that's about how do you know people are

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,810
carrying on contribute interview but

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,669
they just gone below the radar and

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,540
they're not completing reports what are

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:30,220
they doing or are some just going online

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,930
updating information you know projects

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,169
are emailing you and you're copied in on

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,180
it so all of that activity I'm working

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:39,040
remotely are managing it remotely can

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,260
look different but it does give us an

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,960
idea of what that could look like to

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,970
reach party members and then finally

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,610
working life integration separation

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,320
something were all going through and it

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,510
can be so different if you've got a

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,250
family you're trying to navigate well

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,830
just the use of the kitchen table will

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,380
be one you've got children maybe with

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,240
who are home working you you have

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,500
partners are also working from home

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,030
these are the time so we'll talk a

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,150
little bit about what could be good

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,039
practice there as well so lovely picture

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,979
working from home the reality probably

00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:19,720
doesn't look like this in fairness this

00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:23,520
is the middle but life could not well

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,560
each again for all of your team members

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,060
it's about you've probably never be into

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,120
their homes you don't know what their

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:34,229
settle it is so understanding how that

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,139
is for them is going to be important so

00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:41,020
do they need to navigate family and work

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:43,389
with family to get the recipe to people

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,060
want to start early in the morning maybe

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:48,400
have a break for homeschooling or to go

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,599
for a run what does that day look like

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,819
for them

00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:54,509
you'll get much more from people if you

00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:57,999
can understand what best situation is

00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:59,919
and try and navigate away through that

00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:02,289
for all of that I'm taking a sort of a

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,789
poll from all of your teams hopefully

00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:08,080
you've got some common areas where you

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:10,240
can get together steam and so first

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,479
thing I got is House Rules now these are

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,409
literal okay versus get dressed now 7:30

00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:19,509
bizarre one but really important it has

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:22,149
been proven that when you really go from

00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,279
one zone in your head to another you get

00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:26,529
dressed you know get out your fluffy

00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:29,610
dressing-gown or all your sweat pants

00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:31,509
whatever it is does make a difference

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,490
appreciate the moment you know even

00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:36,879
answer the door to the postman but it's

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,709
it doesn't really just help you get in

00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,959
the zone if you like working and

00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:44,110
transitioning from home to a work

00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:47,199
situation as well establish boundaries

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,569
so I'm relating here to what it's like

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,849
in your home how does that work so it

00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:54,909
might be physical boundaries but where

00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:57,759
the children work where you're working

00:06:54,909 --> 00:07:00,550
how's that looking but really

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,509
understanding what that is won't happen

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,490
maybe use of equipments laptops when you

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,999
were what your expectations are in terms

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,689
of the responsibilities and

00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:13,479
accountability when things need to be

00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:15,369
posted to do the rest of the team so

00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:19,360
understanding what that looks like for

00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:23,610
you and having us of a bond of sort of a

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,610
team player is going to be important and

00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:29,319
like take screen breaks seems really

00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:31,979
obvious but it can make a real

00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:35,379
difference to people's mental health

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,699
it's so easy to feel in the morning how

00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,800
they're running in the background all

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,899
time just popping in and out of it

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,360
because you can but it has to be

00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:45,669
improved and taking regular breaks after

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,529
that we moved to taking regular exercise

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:52,149
is important speaking to people there's

00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:55,329
there's lots of software allow us to

00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:58,300
talk to people face-to-face picking up a

00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:00,490
phone the Sun start already starting to

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,229
come out with the availability of people

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,440
who are working from home who actually

00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,210
want to talk

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,680
so think about all those people and your

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,430
clients that you couldn't actually get

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,230
to speak to they may be available

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:16,220
otherwise we just sit behind a sea of

00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:17,960
email and we've got yeah I'm guessing in

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,750
the tech community there is an awful lot

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,120
of emails there's a lot of projects and

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,000
updates and things were putting those

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,770
sort of people on element front and

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,350
center in this situation can be really

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,200
helpful for you for there and the mental

00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:36,620
health of the teams and everything else

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,720
okay and so finding software that works

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:43,729
for your team so we'll talk a little bit

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:46,300
about I know for instance that whatever

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:46,300
they use

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,200
these which was in a zoo there's lots of

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,360
people finding different the owners

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,700
Microsoft team sorry we're using zoom

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,279
there's lots of software allows you to

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,700
communicate with your teams but choosing

00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,560
the right one may be simple or complex

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:09,040
is required there's lots of different

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,860
ones that we can recommend ensure that

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,050
your workplace is secure so I guess I'm

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,630
preaching to the converted here but

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,779
again we have already we've found people

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,269
using laptops that haven't got updated

00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:24,880
security on it we're swapping out with

00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:27,130
children using them so again seems

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,579
really obvious what it's worth this is

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:34,959
worth checking moving regularly taking a

00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:36,940
walk so again it's an interesting path

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,240
most of what we should be doing every

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:46,450
day but sensible screen breaks walking

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:49,899
moving there is also a technique called

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,459
Paulo Dino which is about working for 25

00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,910
minutes and then having a five-minute

00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:54,520
break

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,649
welcome to 21 minutes and a 5-minute

00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,560
break and he's supposed to be very very

00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:05,350
good for production and then finally is

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,450
creating work zones now simply that

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,680
might be a corner of a table but it's an

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,420
area that is your own that you can

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,970
define as your own working space for

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,440
your thumb they may be as well and also

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,839
that you pack up at the end of the day

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,089
and move it away so it's not just sort

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,490
of cluttering up and open again just

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,860
keeping places that are zoomed in your

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,690
minds is useful and helps with

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,220
productivity and again your general

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:35,440
health ok so I'm gonna really more into

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,320
the people elements which is really what

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,140
we wanted to talk about today is what

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,790
motivates your team now I'm taking this

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,949
option here you knew how your team

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,149
operated before they all started to work

00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:50,110
remotely

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,800
so again calling together how that

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,430
worked

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,430
so having clear goals clear objectives

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,079
all the teams now we have something

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,840
where we have a morning meeting

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:03,930
so we

00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:06,330
it's ten o'clock we come with a list of

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,820
things that we will want to do that day

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:11,820
but we also link it to our long term

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,750
objectives meeting tone objectives and

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:18,270
the fixes that are required that day we

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,730
actually verbalize that so it helps you

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,040
get in the zone and concentrate and talk

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,740
about specifically about how you going

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,210
to contribute though you might do that

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,620
in different ways you might have a wash

00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,050
up meeting at the end or a lunchtime

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,190
meeting but it is important to get

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:36,450
things together now I am sort of that

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,640
wall moment

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:42,090
if you've got lots of team players than

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,680
getting on Microsoft instance is going

00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,530
to be a joy because they they will love

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,930
it somebody who was always made we got

00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,120
more specialist role and doesn't need to

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,070
do that and doesn't actually need maybe

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,100
to collaborate with the rest of the team

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,420
I think that's the idea of hell so that

00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,800
might be just that you might have a

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,610
separate call with them to make sure

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,380
that you're touching base with them I'm

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,510
talking through housing you may invite

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,980
them on maybe on a weekly meeting but

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,310
just talking about how you're

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,410
progressing generally don't give most

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,510
motivation the cheapest way to motivate

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:19,260
people is to praise them specifically

00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:23,340
and be genuine and honest with it and

00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:25,200
it's the most heartfelt so public praise

00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,380
can work for some people really well so

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,740
you could do that on your team needs

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,240
individual thanks and praise may be more

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,580
acceptable and comfortable for some of

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,430
your team so again on suddenly how that

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,170
works for individuals there's got to be

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,070
a lot of trust and flexibility is the

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,280
key motivator

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,890
you trust me to work at home I will get

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,760
on I am a specialist in what I do I care

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:52,470
if you give me some flexibility here I

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,120
will work my socks off for you you know

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,870
that's sort of what you want that to

00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,820
feel like I'm going to continue to take

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,950
responsibility I might even step up to

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,200
the place and take new responsibilities

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,090
on which it may be something that's an

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,390
opportunity presents itself in this

00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:12,420
climate so again that's that's important

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:14,670
for instance I'm looking for a new CRM

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,960
system for our company

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,570
something we've never got round to doing

00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,730
while licenses up in August me thinking

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:23,130
yeah good opportunity so that's

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,050
something I've learned that I'm thinking

00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,840
in this climate we need something

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:31,580
different so again different things come

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:35,100
out of working the way we are working on

00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,290
support so support can come in so many

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,240
levels it might be technical support it

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,980
might be the software that you're

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,580
currently using to talk to each other on

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,280
it could be more technical it could be

00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,040
just encouraging people to go out and

00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,440
say go and have some walks it could be

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,140
support around people's mental health as

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,320
well and again tailoring nuts and

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,880
individuals is really important

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,110
incentives and rewards they can come in

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,740
so many different ways

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:08,190
thank you with mentioned some of those

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,070
probably vouchers but with her like lead

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,750
in talks will be useful you may even

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,050
sound just a bunch of Easter eggs out to

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:18,330
a family of your team whatever that

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,300
looks like and it's just important to

00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,520
tailor it to the individual situation so

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,770
communicating a shared vision so I'll

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,900
talk a little bit more about it's so

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,850
important because you're not seeing each

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,580
other everybody understands how

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,150
everything fits together what you're all

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,500
doing fits in with the greater good

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:40,530
we'll talk a little bit more about and

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,510
briefings than some sort but again not

00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:45,030
to people to feel marginalized and

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,780
separate is how it all adds up to the

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,820
sum of the parts is helping the company

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:53,010
sort of maintain its position

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,840
potentially move forward and what it's

00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:59,040
learning from that journey as well and

00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:02,940
how you will contribute into it okay so

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,070
direction difficult one yeah it is a lot

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,830
of what we're doing is based on trust

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:10,220
there are lots of different pieces of

00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:12,060
software there's lots of reporting

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,400
mechanisms that you can do but

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,040
essentially it's about setting you stall

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,660
to say you trust people understand what

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,750
they're accountable for and some what

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,210
they're responsible for and monitor

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,910
performance levels now it's difficult

00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,980
one because we are in something that is

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,899
probably not compare

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,310
if you have someone in your team for

00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:36,380
instance that has worked from home

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:38,630
before normal kid that they need then

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,700
you shouldn't you should expect that to

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,560
be done to function as normal

00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,779
whereas someone who maybe has never

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,410
worked from home before and suddenly

00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:51,829
finds themselves in a completely alien

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,510
situation then yeah again understanding

00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:56,029
what that feels like and looks like I

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,269
can talk for myself you know I'm used to

00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:03,380
having in an office good support

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:05,810
printers machinery two screens and now

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,149
at home with a laptop on a very small

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,550
monitor and everything is taking me

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:13,010
twice and not three times long to do so

00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,889
I think you understanding what that how

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:18,050
we can be fair with our judgments on

00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:20,060
performance is is going to be important

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,579
but again that's the discussion you have

00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,050
with individuals although that could not

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:27,860
that I can how they could be flexible

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:30,050
and get the most in the situation I've

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,790
touched on some other software already

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:36,949
the Microsoft and slack is one that

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,540
clients use zoom we mentioned asana I

00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:42,740
think it more complex and really good

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:45,529
for project management needs this is one

00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,810
I found which is a focus mates so this

00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:50,089
is for the ones who you know that you're

00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,769
not very good at working from home so

00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:54,140
you're working from home normally

00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:56,540
involves lots of snacks maybe a little

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,120
break tea breaks that will wander in the

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,209
garden with you Morgan walking the dog

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,370
so obviously the software download it

00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:06,410
and it seems you're with someone who

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,449
monitors your performance during the day

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,250
and sends a little reporter so you look

00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,630
up and they be looking at you and they

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,549
know you're not there and you're not

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,280
working so long yeah

00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:18,079
there's something to think about if you

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,079
you know yourself and know that could be

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:25,040
a potential issue

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:27,380
okay so just talked about earlier about

00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,100
the pledge meetings we have so this

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,840
could be an idea that you could adopt um

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,570
so this is people saying I will do this

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:39,590
and these are my goals today this week

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,330
this month its highlights activities

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,660
that involve in what you're doing so

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,670
again

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,740
really important because if there is

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,790
collaboration there is support needed

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,710
some of the members of the team

00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,870
everybody knows what they're working on

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,940
you can take that offline afterwards you

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,830
know information can be sent could be

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,380
shared people can stay online and have

00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:00,590
the discussion but it gets most

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:05,300
important visions don't exist within the

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:07,070
team and unregular porting and people

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,770
then understand what they're accountable

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:12,590
for so we keep minutes about meeting but

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,810
it's on on zoom' we keep it up it's a

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,650
shared file it's opened up every morning

00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:20,570
and we report on that I genuinely feel

00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,150
like something that we would do as a

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,560
team going forward because it's all too

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,630
easy to come into the office in the

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,270
morning so new computer on get your

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,760
cuppa tea sit down and start working and

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,500
actually not talking so I think these

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,130
are some of the things that may come out

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:39,200
of this practice and how we are we may

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,160
be shape while our new working landscape

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:47,360
going forward okay regular company of

00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,970
updates really again important to focus

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,840
on you as manager supporting them how

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:56,150
they fit into the team and the business

00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:02,090
there's so much legislation new things

00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:03,770
happening around hey so I so again it

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,270
could be a very useful vehicle

00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,400
oh is it is very personal to an

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:11,420
individual I wouldn't use this mechanism

00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,220
but understanding how you are clients

00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,550
maybe you want to talk about billing

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:19,850
whatever that we would normally be able

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,890
to share please remember to do this in

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,810
your regular updates we will start

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,420
feeling very lonely I'm on the road and

00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:28,670
that just adds to worry there's enough

00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,880
going on with the virus itself in

00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,770
people's home situations without

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,140
wondering what's going on in a work

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,110
situation as well so even if it's only

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,300
links to government sites it just helps

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,780
them be more informed it just shows that

00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,640
you're on it you're thinking about it

00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,630
any thinking how it could affect them as

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,630
a team as well

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,630
though I talked about support um now

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,510
this top one for the team opportunity to

00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,970
upscale of course I run a trading

00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:04,950
company I would say this but we have

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:09,990
seen a real rise in people coming to

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:14,020
courses maybe webinars or email Elan

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,520
courses as well so good opportunity so

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,590
you know you think about yes I've always

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,660
wanted to learn how to do pivot tables

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:23,799
in Excel and never got the time to do it

00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:27,130
I would be doing but you know it's again

00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:29,530
great opportunity to think about the

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:32,830
future what skills we may need what

00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:35,620
looks like maybe I do need to obscure on

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:38,799
some new software what's that going to

00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,900
look like maybe you also need to support

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,210
the team with some good remote technical

00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,320
support if that's required and also

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,490
called a mental health support as well

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,950
again I've said I've included some

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,559
information around that so you know and

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,450
you know you've been on maybe a call for

00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,610
a couple of hours just at the end of it

00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,770
remind the big good walk don't get some

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,260
fresh air you know this will come back

00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:05,410
to this another time if you can hear

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,970
that people are struggling and you

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,790
haven't got their voice so you've got

00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:13,630
maybe if you know people look at me up

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:17,500
some simple signs for some people being

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,610
alone at home it's not going to be good

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,549
for their mental health

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,470
so again if that's not your area of

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:26,580
expertise there are a number of

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:29,230
different charities and supports the

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,780
MHSA or extremely good they have

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:35,500
consultants that will impartial II

00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,929
helped you get into it and then it's

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,640
it's not not a discussion that maybe you

00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,410
want to have all you're comfortable

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,120
having or feel you have the expertise

00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,870
where you can gather them to the right

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,870
places as well

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,320
so as we come towards the end it's a

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:55,250
video presentation so work less

00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,350
separation please try not just to flick

00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,900
your laptop's on first in the morning

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:03,860
when you wake up it's so easy for all

00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,690
this to not have boundaries and areas

00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,820
where you can work where you need your

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,610
home time you need your family time

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,919
whatever that looks like for you is it's

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,200
very easy to just be to be ruining in

00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,960
the background all the time is not a

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,330
good way and it's certainly it has been

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,460
proven time and time again that it's not

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:27,080
good after productivity and leads very

00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:29,150
quickly to burnout okay one thing is do

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,669
nothing but work in your workspace I

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,799
know that is very easy but again there

00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:35,630
have been pictures we've seen already of

00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:37,460
people literally moving their laptop

00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,770
open and moving their place in to have

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,370
their dinner but so just again how the

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:45,740
areas of demarcation where you can be

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:49,580
your be productive in your in your best

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:52,429
way and leave your workspace half breaks

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,169
you know half happy on the hours those

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,140
things are not mutually inclusive my

00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:59,570
work but you can make sure that we

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,980
separate these are things that come back

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,200
to your house rules these are things

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,409
that you have with your partner's wife

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,370
your children we need to agree those

00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:12,530
things as a family

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:14,510
and as hard as it is and it's really I'm

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,730
not that in that situation myself I have

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,950
every respect for those who Jubilee all

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:22,159
of those things but their conversations

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,669
that you need to have to happen so

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:28,760
really just say thank you very much we

00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:30,620
will move very shortly into a live Q&A

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,059
so there's anything that I've raised any

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,669
issues about they want to know more

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:41,179
about I dieted to help in any way I can

00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:43,100
thank you the questions in the chat one

00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:46,010
from Louise I've noticed as well

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:49,750
actually how would you keep what team

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,750
morale would given the current situation

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:57,669
knowing your and the team helps and what

00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:00,729
you know what used to be fun for them

00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:02,429
Calla can be translated into group

00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:06,399
activities as well you might have

00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:08,019
competitions we've seen some things

00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:11,649
where people host

00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:13,749
fun funny funny pictures jokey things

00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:16,269
and signs that they've got going on up

00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:18,579
in their house to involve other people

00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:22,929
as well so that you are sort of sharing

00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:27,070
that side of it as well sort of five top

00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:30,940
tips of the day I mean and some sort of

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:33,070
maybe incentives and form we do simple

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,499
one like we're on for dinner that that

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,209
nice what are we doing so we try not

00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:43,229
make it into a bit of a sort of but we

00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:45,820
call it a coded sort of festive that is

00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:47,679
that's negative but we just try and

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,059
think we're going to walk - can we do to

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,709
make the bestest situation

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:54,450
when finding moving more into the

00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:54,450
personal side seems to be working better

00:24:54,899 --> 00:25:03,849
cool okay yeah we would actually hosted

00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:05,979
a pop quiz on Friday as well which we

00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:07,749
did it over Microsoft teams and you know

00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:09,759
we just had an app that you can download

00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:12,309
and all the questions are on there so

00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:15,579
everyone you know grab the drink in and

00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:17,320
we all have a bit of a catch up see I

00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:19,679
personally recommend that as well as

00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,679
Parlophone

00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:26,589
any ideas for work social as well I've

00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,149
just touched on that but where people

00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:30,429
could do things outside of work as well

00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:32,619
you know I think you are still speaking

00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,969
to your team a lot during the day so you

00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:37,589
know perhaps stuff that you can do that

00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:42,759
doesn't necessarily involve work stuff

00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:46,929
yes I think yeah definitely it seems to

00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:48,639
be photographs people have set up things

00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:52,299
like how far they're walking I mean I

00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:55,239
didn't we've done with a mercury Cancer

00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:57,639
Trust we've done 10,000 steps so we've

00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:59,649
all got and we report on that and we've

00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:02,849
a little bit ask a loved who's winning

00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:05,469
so there's a bit of competition there

00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:07,299
you know we've got my best pooch things

00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:09,179
we've got seen lots of different things

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:12,779
that go on

00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:14,450
but it's it's again sort of diversifying

00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,979
it's not just the team it's also

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,869
everyone is in that home if you like and

00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:21,179
that and the house as well and involving

00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:22,799
them but it does it's you know if you're

00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:26,450
a competitive team then you'll always

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,450
find something to be competitive about

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:34,499
good alright so one thing that's been

00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:36,269
brought up quite a lot I've seen a lot

00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:38,129
of posts on linkedin about this and then

00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:41,489
we've been touching on it a little bit

00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:43,529
Woodrow Mercer as well and you know if

00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:44,700
Braun's at home and you can't go

00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:47,460
anywhere right now so obviously

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,700
everyone's sore banking holidays annual

00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,320
leave and you know do use that now or

00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,029
does everyone go on a two-week holiday

00:26:52,320 --> 00:27:03,389
when we come out of this you know what

00:26:54,029 --> 00:27:08,549
what we thought okay so HR or managerial

00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:11,940
perspective I think generally if you can

00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:13,440
take holidays now and you're it means

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,479
that you're maybe running slightly with

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,879
the skeleton staff but actually in that

00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:20,399
might fit quite well with the workflow

00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:22,489
at the moment so you're giving people a

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:26,489
little bit more family time together

00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:30,029
you're reducing the pressure for the

00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:31,379
return to work because the work the land

00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:33,629
the work landscape will be entirely

00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:36,239
different things will ramp up again

00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:39,950
maybe in a different way so you all want

00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:42,629
you will want to have people available

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:45,749
so you know people can't always by the

00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:47,789
holidays so companies will have new

00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:51,269
cause of holiday zone so they can only

00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:53,639
take so much holiday in various times of

00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,799
the year and that normally depends on

00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:58,229
whether people got children or not or

00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,479
whether people want to go so I think

00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:02,190
that those probably those sort of

00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:05,009
guidelines should will still be in place

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,950
so I didn't generally in people will be

00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:09,659
able to completely bank holidays and it

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,549
could impact greatly on the business so

00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:14,669
I think having reasonable conversations

00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:16,830
again with your teams on how on what

00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:18,929
would work for them people often quite

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,369
grateful I mean you know simple things I

00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:22,860
we've got a couple of members of our

00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:24,870
team that some were honest they were

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,850
and they're actually going to a week and

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,350
they're going to go training we've got

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,450
someone else within allotments and they

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,809
said great we'll have that time off to

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,910
use it so it's it's again it's very

00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:39,540
personal to the individual team members

00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:41,700
as well but generally I doubt whether it

00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,309
will be good practice to bank holidays

00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,110
as such I think you can bank the money I

00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:47,850
think that's probably one thing at the

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:49,170
moment no one spend any money's on

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,120
holidays I think maybe start thinking

00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:55,590
about the great holidays you can have

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,169
when when all this changes yeah

00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:01,100
absolutely and you've obviously touched

00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:04,559
on on mental health a little bit as well

00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,440
it's a bit of a distressing time for

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,179
everyone anyway like like today but then

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,150
I think if you look at it from business

00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,740
perspective there's a lot of results

00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,270
driven businesses out there where the

00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,299
pressure is going to be really on you

00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:21,030
know to essentially survive this you

00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,919
know so what would you advise for not

00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,380
letting that pressure you know kind of

00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,530
affect your team and and you know kind

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,919
of roll downhill to them if you like

00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:33,809
okay I think mental health is such a

00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:37,350
personal thing you know some people will

00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:39,630
step ward and feel like they can control

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,620
it they're in control of it but actually

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:44,940
I know people who are very robust

00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:47,340
mentally and this has affected them

00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,549
quite badly so I think it's it's

00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,620
understanding again if you know the

00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:55,230
person the way they are and the way

00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:58,890
they're now starting able to behave then

00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:02,520
you need to support them in an

00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:06,419
individual way it is it is very

00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:11,309
difficult and I have heard reports that

00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:12,840
it's so easy now for people who then

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,750
probably needs to develop more coping

00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,390
mechanisms and they used to because

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,940
where it was a release for you know

00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,070
getting out going to the pub socialising

00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,590
they were all mechanisms that help

00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:28,230
support people's mental health and when

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:31,770
stripping all of that away it's very

00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:34,140
exposing so encourage everyone to and

00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,980
I've got about it the presentation is

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,409
get out get fresh air

00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,450
it really important stuff and there

00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:42,789
there's simple things but if for those

00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:45,750
who were struggling then they may need

00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:48,370
to talk to more professional help and

00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,679
support and there is an awful lot on

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:55,029
line most of people in mental health

00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:57,159
first aider I know now that I've been

00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:59,049
sent and lots of things a lot of

00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:02,350
resources that when able meet the

00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:03,820
practice online so there is support out

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,309
there and I think it's also being

00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,590
mindful that you know maybe as a manager

00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:11,289
you're not the right person to speak to

00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:13,210
and that's actually the role of First

00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:15,639
Aiders that's what they were there is

00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,669
that it was someone who wasn't in the

00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:20,230
hierarchical structure of a company but

00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,630
actually was someone who was a really

00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:26,500
good listener and could help another

00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:30,610
game point you to the right places so I

00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,500
think it's a very personal approach well

00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,500
there are there is and all that out

00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:38,049
there but I think if sometimes if you

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:41,380
feel it's maybe budding people up that

00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:43,059
you think may be quite different in

00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,870
terms of personalities and the way they

00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:46,929
view the world

00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:49,179
maybe you sort of help each other or

00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:50,919
budding off on a work project again

00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:52,809
can't just help and that there might be

00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:56,440
more talking more dialogue than there

00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:58,809
would be with you so you're putting some

00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,970
mechanisms in yeah we're really good

00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:03,610
suggestions I think particularly the

00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:06,820
body or not thing and sounds really

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:09,070
useful and so I think there's one last

00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:12,070
question on the channel by the looks of

00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:14,980
it and I think probably wrap it not to

00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:18,010
be fair but so so do you have any books

00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:21,840
in particular around organizing yourself

00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:30,309
or am i working that you would recommend

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:36,100
do you know I don't when I was

00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:38,529
researching for this course there is we

00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,510
are on uncharted territory there is so

00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:42,970
fully my working there is things effects

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:46,029
were working but I think the convergence

00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:48,129
of what home workings look like there

00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:49,760
probably isn't much out there that's

00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:53,120
because it's it's only

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:57,550
you there is a guide which I will share

00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:01,040
with you which was produced by the NHS I

00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:03,830
had up the healthcare division so that

00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:06,170
was particularly relevant to people who

00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,450
were normally would come to the hospital

00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,790
and work and then suddenly mainly the

00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:13,610
administration and management teams are

00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,830
certainly working from home and there

00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,080
was some guidelines given that I thought

00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:21,140
were very useful so I'll happily share

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,150
those with you I'll have a look for a

00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,940
couple of months on flex were working as

00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:39,530
well but I think we're in unique times

00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:41,330
maybe there's a book I think that is

00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,880
pretty much everything bothered by the

00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:48,110
way of questions Chris obviously thank

00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:50,390
you very much again ok any time to

00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,550
deliver this really much appreciate and

00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,200
as you've mentioned obviously will make

00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,720
the resources available for anyone who

00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,610
wants and so began touch if you've been

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:04,360
watching and let me know what you after

00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:04,360
