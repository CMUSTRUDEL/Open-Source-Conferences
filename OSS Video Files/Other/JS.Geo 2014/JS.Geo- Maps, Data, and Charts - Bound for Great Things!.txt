alright well my name is Vanessa roshambo

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,859
or GIS specialist with create our

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,289
company this is Laura Ferguson she's a

00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:29,829
CTO of our company we are originally

00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:32,259
going to do a presentation on our

00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:35,410
application and how we're using angular

00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,750
to kind of get our data to run all

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,960
around our application to chart our data

00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:45,790
we're actually using cesium as our

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,550
engine for application and then we got

00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,960
here and we heard an earlier talk that

00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,180
kind of touched on an issue that we've

00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,390
been having with our rendering of our

00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,500
buildings and we've come we've kind of

00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,510
come to the understanding within the

00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,329
last few weeks since we transitioned the

00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,070
cesium that this is an overlying issue

00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,869
that the community might be able to help

00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:09,070
us out with or that maybe we should all

00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:10,899
push forward together on and then we saw

00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,940
with Patrick's talk like how awesome

00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:14,170
cesium is and be blood season and you

00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,119
know we just really want to make it work

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,940
so we decided to kind of railroad our

00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:21,280
talk to that topic of our rendering

00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,130
issues in cesium so that we can get a

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,649
dialogue going with you guys so and when

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,470
the with the understanding go get here

00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:32,410
tomorrow with foss4g so if you want your

00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,739
angular deathly grab them in the hallway

00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:40,509
and they can talk about angular so our

00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:43,840
bingo card is doubtful angular I won an

00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:47,470
hour ago with Hilbert curve so I forgot

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,039
the shout out bingo so take it away so

00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:53,590
we're just kind of kind of go through

00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:55,840
how a history of our app of the recent

00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,060
history when we done some transitioning

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,830
from google earth the cesium and kind of

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,959
the things we've had a deal with going

00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,759
through that but feel free to chime in

00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,440
this is we want this to be more of an

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,979
open dialogue in a conversation that

00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:14,470
more of a presentations so so what do we

00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:16,390
do Laura tell me to do so um vanessa is

00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,000
a GIS data analyst

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,890
introduction I'm actually originally a

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,380
Java developer and JavaScript developer

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:27,310
for a long time well job a long time in

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,590
JavaScript I recently and what we're

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,140
doing is we're building a real estate

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,520
financials analysis system and that

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,670
sounds really dull but when you throw

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,800
GIS in there it's like wow and you can

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,450
we're moving towards things like

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,280
building buildings on the fly and stuff

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,320
like that but right now we just want to

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,209
give real estate developers the context

00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,319
the three-dimensional context of the

00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,720
buildings that they're looking at the

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,920
space they're looking at and the context

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,410
where they're talking about building a

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,080
building and then they going off into

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,940
sort of the financial analysis world but

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,400
keeping that three-dimensional context

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,080
with them and so our challenge is to

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,590
build a software-as-a-service product

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,480
that's on top of a GIS platform that has

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,550
to perform well because these are guys

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,700
who barely know how to use excel let

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,810
alone something more fancy on the web so

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,959
we're not going to be telling them to

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,610
clear their cash or anything else and we

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,519
started off with Googlers then we'll

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,410
talk about that in a minute I don't know

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,720
that the graphic is a little fuzzy but

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:32,130
just understand this as it shows a

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:35,950
profit and how much that profit is so

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,150
this is a little bit of a look at the 3d

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,120
models that we're doing we're actually

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,610
extruding building footprints and

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,010
there's actually an injury model here

00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,500
that was Native magic plan and then

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,390
brought into the system we're helping to

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,220
automate that whole process of peeps you

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,260
like for example that's a bunch of row

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,290
houses in Georgetown if you want to turn

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,420
those into corporate apartments you

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,640
could set up a whole financial model you

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,470
could model go inside get all the

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,230
interior models then you'd have a whole

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:09,130
presentation to take the community or to

00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:12,400
your investors and get buy-in from those

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,870
different stakeholders and so we think

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,390
that this is like the wave of the future

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,120
because up until now basically they just

00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,880
bring a giant chunk of paper into a

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,990
meeting and say here this is the project

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,669
we're building and of course no one

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,440
reads that this is something they could

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,220
actually present and really make a case

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,190
for why this for

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,440
killer idea for what to do with this

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,900
face is going to benefit the

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,230
neighborhood benefit whoever's investing

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:43,880
in it okay getting into the technical

00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:49,250
side of things I talked about um okay

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:52,220
javascript you want so we use a lot of

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,860
javascript in our app which is why we

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,350
came here on the back end we do use

00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,750
postgres that's our database and we use

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,280
a Java in the back end as well but for

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,960
the most part all of our front end is

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,090
JavaScript um you know lightly mostly

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,970
package manager to get all of our

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,490
components together we use angular to

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,670
bind our data and to get it talking from

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:19,940
the cz initialized map all the way to

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:21,169
all of our views and to our charts we

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,270
use three different trading systems

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,970
which we're trying to get a feel for

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,160
what look seems best we use Google

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,080
charts for some basic rendering use

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,870
chart j/s for some basic wondering um

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,820
we're starting to get more into be three

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,460
to get some really awesome graphics in

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,970
there and they all are equally easy to

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:44,120
get our scope data to inform our charts

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,100
so it's pretty awesome and then recently

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,849
we have transitioned from google earth

00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,069
to cesium which we love

00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:55,129
but we run into a piece issues with that

00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:58,699
so we want to talk about our first

00:05:55,129 --> 00:06:00,770
approach with Google Earth and I was not

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:02,569
around when the new google earth I just

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,580
started with the company six weeks ago

00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:08,770
so i'ma let Laura talk about that okay

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,770
how do I get that to go back up kind

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:16,240
gesture control how'd you get that link

00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:16,240
to come up you just put on I did that

00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:26,300
hang on okay follow the link thank you

00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,429
very much we'll do it the old-fashioned

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:41,539
way you to turn up your screen

00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:47,830
brightness though so um you know think

00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:47,830
of she showing you long screen yeah

00:06:49,820 --> 00:07:04,370
oh we switched which go to display sorry

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:13,610
technical difficulties we discuss which

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:20,170
the display any other desk and it

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:20,170
doesn't render does anyone know why

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:47,000
others there we go okay thank you very

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:53,930
much okay Wow all right that's not bad

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,300
um so a little bit I just zoom out a

00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,050
little bit here so this is Washington DC

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,150
we're based in DC so our first target

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,890
market here is is to kind of get in here

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,540
on washington DC this is george town

00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:10,190
like i was saying and then we actually

00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:12,050
have this magic plan render of this of

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,900
it's actually EDS house one of our

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:20,860
co-founders and we can kind of zip in

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:24,260
here and see that whole layout and and

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,450
then move out and then we have various

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,190
kinds of filtering things which are

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:33,560
better shown actually in the cesium

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:35,330
version but so what i wanted to show you

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,800
here though mostly is the translucency

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,229
because that's what we're going to talk

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,530
about with cesium so you see it's got a

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:46,610
pretty good pretty good rendering on

00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:48,230
this is a fairly low resolution transfer

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,300
to the big screen but if you see it in

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,760
high resolution on the small computer on

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,310
a laptop you know because you're pretty

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,580
nice feel and we like the fact that you

00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,120
can

00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:01,340
I see the ground map through it we also

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,470
played with having you know full

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,980
building renderings but again we do want

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,090
to have these interiors modeled so

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,200
transparency is really important to what

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:14,380
we're doing so going back to the talk

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,380
where's your

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,580
okay so that's Google Earth so now then

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:31,750
we were we talked to Google and they're

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,940
like well you know we're going to be

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,750
phasing out google earth and we were

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,980
already having issues with windows

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,330
because I frames don't play nice and

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,530
when you're starting to talk about a

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,940
software-as-a-service product there's

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,200
lots and lots of windows it all in

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,200
JavaScript and they're not playing nice

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,780
with the back end so that created

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,410
layering issues it requires a plug-in

00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,710
obviously a downside and now it's really

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,150
dead so not good other options we looked

00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:00,220
at a whole bunch this is just some of

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:04,150
them we looked at here com they don't

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:06,640
have 3d yet esri not ready unity too

00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,650
much you know the data sourcing in the

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,710
process of creating the unity map is

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,680
going to really blow all of our schedule

00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:17,170
and cesium ready to go so we got really

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:22,210
excited about that and we built up the

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:24,550
cesium the cesium modelin so now that we

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,670
have adopted cesium we converted our

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:30,400
platform cesium we like cesium because

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,530
it allows us to bring our TV kind of

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:37,690
thematic maps are informative mats over

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:39,910
from that box possibly Carter DB and the

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:44,020
3d part is awesome because we can bring

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:46,570
in our google or kmz building models

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,000
from previous we can go to outside

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:52,120
vendors like cyber city 3d and maybe get

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,270
some more up to date or more informative

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,090
3d models or we can even implement 3j s

00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,400
and maybe create our own building models

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,740
procedural generation we can kind of

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,200
play with that in 3gs and we can do that

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,460
all in cesium and be fully supported and

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,190
contribute to the community going

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:14,110
forward and so we're really happy about

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,769
that but then once we kind of got cesium

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,980
up and running

00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:20,350
we thought everything was great and then

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,540
we started seeing some rendering issues

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,449
with our translucency our transparency

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,309
in our buildings will show you what it

00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:36,329
looks like when it's in its best form

00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:36,329
first how are you good bye 15 minutes

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:52,070
so here we have our translucency so so

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,529
it looks good to us and we have our

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,410
buildings here caesium allows us to do

00:11:54,529 --> 00:12:02,209
these really cool things like just out

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:04,190
of the box bring in some geo-locating so

00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:08,330
we can see what property address we're

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:12,560
looking at we can out of the box bring

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:15,740
in a capability to bring in some tiling

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:20,180
layers so we can see retail areas

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:21,980
clusters so cesium just has so many

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:27,200
different plugins that we can use in

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:29,630
order to make our appt really awesome

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,970
but the only issue we're seeing and

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:35,839
we're hoping that you all can help us

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:38,209
inform this is that we found that on

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:44,149
some computers that alpha transparency

00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:46,760
is making swishing and causing snow for

00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:49,010
certain GPUs and mostly for macbook airs

00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,230
although we haven't been able to test it

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:56,890
on a larger scale for other different

00:12:51,230 --> 00:13:01,910
types of computers so I'm sure you ready

00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:03,560
yeah show their images first okay so i

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:08,000
don't know if you can see well how does

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:11,720
it was really good the little black

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,330
speck is it it's m so from the web's

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,000
from the cesium perspective what's the

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,980
issue with ye Mordor and polygon

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,320
coordinates yeah I don't think it's

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,850
wrong in order so generally in computer

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,540
graphics there's two ways to do

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,300
translucency the one is a

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,790
from sorting in an alpha blending and

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,410
that can be really hard for translucency

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:36,190
to intersect each other because you can

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,930
flip those cesium can do that but the

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,660
hardware supports voting point textures

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,850
and local render targets will do order

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,759
independent travel agency which is

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:48,910
blending based on a4a very significant

00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,649
alphabet in here so in this case I

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,319
suspect it's fallen doctor after

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:57,339
blending and I suspect the drivers are

00:13:53,319 --> 00:14:00,459
not up to snuff but I think approach

00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:04,720
would love to be up machine yeah well

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:07,889
yeah well we when we updated tumor

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,139
cesium that went to oit or input

00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:12,850
transparency we reverted back to

00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:14,500
millennia and you saw with the

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,630
performance increase a little bit that

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:23,079
soul was not what we wanted it to be so

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:25,480
where our hypothesis is is that maybe

00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,850
some of the newer GPUs are so optimized

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,610
that maybe they're not able to render

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,680
things because when we look outside of

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,440
our own application and into the sand

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,529
box or the sand castle on seeking site

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,589
some computers still have issues reading

00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:43,180
it so this is a 2011 macbook air but we

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,180
literally been buying computers like the

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:49,870
last couple weeks and even like one week

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:52,029
old macbook airs have the same issue and

00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,290
you know there's no update so there's

00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:56,110
going to be an update it's going to have

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,819
to come from you know our community

00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,790
setting some kind of standard and

00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:02,949
getting that to Apple to kind of make

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:08,550
the difference i mean i can bring up

00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:08,550
also what this looks like um for us

00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:15,279
while that's loading on the back but

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:18,810
clearly you know we've tried different

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,860
this is the sandbox and you know

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,660
depending on the machine it would kind

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,579
of get different performance but

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,860
basically all the MacBook Airs we've

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:36,790
tried we've gotten the

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:39,910
the JD effect or the snow effect I'm

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:44,800
sorry kids can can we put it in which

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:47,470
rose resolution how do you wrap bacon

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:56,740
foam foot ok so Paul's replicating

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:59,710
itself but plugged in better no we

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,450
haven't really we can add that to the

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:06,640
test but we haven't seen so far that

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:10,690
that has so cesium itself is awesome

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:14,230
it's just I think the newer optimization

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,060
of the GPU rendering WebGL is the issue

00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,840
that maybe as a community we should push

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,550
the manufacturers to try to pay more

00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,990
attention to this for our sake if we're

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:28,390
going to be pushing for this kind of

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:30,490
technology closer it gets a little

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,290
better the closer you get on some

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,770
machines the problem goes away if you go

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:38,470
very close now we are still we're still

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:42,100
optimizing our engine I mean this is

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,990
literally two weeks like we're still in

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,750
the middle of trying to figure out how

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:48,940
many buildings we can render and even

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,070
today I heard some ideas about how to

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,850
optimize that better these are all just

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:57,550
straight extruded polygons without a lot

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,230
of specialized the through hate you

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,910
still have the same problem if they're

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,620
opaque the problem goes away but if

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,110
they're like the building with the

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,240
interior has translucency so that one

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,850
still has snow so we actually have an

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,870
opaque version of the demo that our CEO

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:15,820
uses because he has a macbook air so we

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:19,000
have a very clear driver I'd like to get

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,280
him a new computer but is his new so and

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,220
obviously it needs to work for every

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,189
user for for us to actually be

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,900
the selfish products so we have to have

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:34,289
a solution of one sort or another would

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:36,240
like it to be seeking any other thoughts

00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:37,799
or questions yeah well this doesn't

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,960
really help you right now but one way

00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:46,230
that you can apply pressure to vendors

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,770
is to file bugs on browsers and can also

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:52,970
talk to see you guys are very well in

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,530
touch with the route their fingers and

00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,590
if we can narrow the sorting down to a

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,210
simple test we can add this web GL or

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,909
that's sweet yeah there's a lot of

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,700
pressure in these days for vu drivers to

00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:09,419
pass those yeah the sandbox sent me a

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,610
good example I mean you know we clearly

00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,260
seen that on the macbook pros or China

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,080
most developers that's what we're using

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:20,070
it works fine we get on the macbook air

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,720
there's problems so it does differ also

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,409
between browsers it's a little better on

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:30,510
safari but it does take forever to load

00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:32,640
so you know there's we have accumulated

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:36,030
data and left will actually get this in

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,980
a minute we had a survey to help us get

00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,720
some data if you guys have helped out

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,640
especially if you have a partner or

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,250
friend with the macbook air or any other

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,820
computer great to get as much data as we

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:56,789
can so that we can present that in a

00:18:47,820 --> 00:19:00,150
coherent I have a brand new macbook pro

00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:01,919
it's totally fine so do i yeah we're

00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,929
really only singing on air we haven't

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:09,000
seen it on any Linux machines any

00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:10,590
windows machines and older macs seemed

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,600
to work fine I have an older mac that

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,980
works fine it's just really the areas

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,110
that we're seeing an issue but we really

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,850
want to get a nice sample size some good

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,280
testing and hopefully you guys can help

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,200
us in a bit so this is what we want and

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,750
that's what it looks like on my computer

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,590
and it's gorgeous and we go

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:32,090
on this but then we see this on 2013

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:35,960
macbook air 2011 macbook air 2011

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:37,790
macbook air different browsers so we're

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,030
just really want to solve this problem

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:43,220
because cesium is is a great thing for

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:52,070
us and it's basically I think just the

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:59,270
WebGL thing not as of yet i am only

00:19:52,070 --> 00:20:02,270
within the less yeah why would besides

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:05,420
the sandbox great this one season yes i

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,860
think we ever web feel sure yeah and

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,480
there's a nice site i found the other

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,280
day and maybe we'll add that to our

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,280
surveil the point of the end today

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:27,610
texting this party actually be activated

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:30,610
the GOI meter long haul which safari was

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,610
hot

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:42,200
features are okay interesting there you

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:46,370
know okay i'll give away a MacBook Pro

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:50,450
to each new customer right now God these

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:53,390
guys took me back to 2007-2008 Google

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,390
Earth just comes out right and my you're

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,860
doing points lines and all the gods

00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,500
notice how good the work that we do ball

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,200
players had pointed not know polygons

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,770
because these fields are incredibly

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,170
intensive on people's graphics cards so

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,420
i created a least math of the Rocky

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:16,370
Mountains oil and gas color driven by

00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:19,840
company 40,000 polygons and beautiful

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:22,490
film polygons a nice pattern of

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,580
exploitation of the landscape for

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:29,750
hydrocarbons and so the first guy I show

00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:32,270
it to PhD in geology rich guy he's going

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,700
to make me famous so I said click on

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,260
this layer it comes up when it's google

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,160
earth and this whole machine just

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:44,420
crashes right and that was last time I

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,250
did Phil polygon or the idea of trying

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:50,600
to predict what your customers will have

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:55,910
in its it's incredibly stressful from a

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:58,030
business perspective what one or two

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,530
more questions from the audience

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,360
anything about the app itself that we

00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,920
actually showed only a little bit of

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,420
what we're doing but we're really

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,720
playing with layers and visualizations

00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:11,240
and stuff like that or angular questions

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,660
just a comment to see me afterwards and

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,710
you know chat Divya

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,450
station so I could run a half double

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,450
work around but I really think it's

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:22,580
going to be a good intelligence yeah

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,740
definitely but it might help you with

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,330
the work ethic cool you know it's

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,710
interesting because I've been developer

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:32,540
a long time and I remember when we first

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:35,330
got houses in in our front-end software

00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,830
development and I think we saw some of

00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,880
this sort of my recollections a little

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:43,580
foggy and I think that they must have

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,620
optimized out unless it's the security

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,290
thing we were talking about it feels to

00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,810
me like they optimized out some work

00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:53,600
around that made it all work in these

00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:56,270
very tightly optimized graphics cards

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,410
and that we've somehow gotten so secure

00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,840
that everything is going to work fine

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,490
that we missed a step like me we didn't

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,180
have the test in place so it seems like

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,800
as a community and I appreciate how warm

00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,980
this community is this is my first time

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:14,180
here but as a community if we can

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,160
establish a baseline test for WebGL and

00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,230
in what our expectations are but that's

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,150
an important step no matter whether that

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,120
solves this problem or not because

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,470
that's something where you know we want

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,690
the hardware manufacturers to be aware

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,030
of the high end users or the high end

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:32,600
applications rather that we're going to

00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:35,600
be putting out there so right now you've

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,930
actually the other the other reality of

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,720
the general generic user and then the

00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:45,040
gaming community rages leaps and bounds

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:49,910
ahead of what they're doing with

00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:52,310
graphics and frame range etc final

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:56,830
thoughts questions comments ask these

00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,830
questions thank you

00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,470
you

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,070
