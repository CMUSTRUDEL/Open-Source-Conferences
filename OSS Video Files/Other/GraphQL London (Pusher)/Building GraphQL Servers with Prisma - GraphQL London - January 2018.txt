Description: 
	Johannes is a Berlin/SF-based entrepreneur and founder of Graphcool, a GraphQL database proxy & platform. He previously built and sold the VR company *Optonaut*. Johannes studied computer science at KIT, Germany and loves cutting-edge Mobile/Web technologies.

Prisma is an open-source GraphQL API layer that turns your database into a GraphQL API. It is also the core technology powering the Graphcool Framework and now available for everyone to build their own GraphQL servers. Together with GraphQL bindings, it drastically improves developer experience for developing backends that are based on GraphQL.

In this talk, youâ€™ll learn more about what Prisma actually is, how it works, why we built it and of course how you can use to build your own GraphQL servers!
