Publication date: 2018-02-06
Playlist: GraphQL London
Description: 
	SÃ¸ren Bramer Schmidt is a founder and CTO of Graphcool responsible for running and scaling thousands of GraphQL servers. Before Graphcool, he was employee #1 at TrustPilot where he helped grow the company to become one of the Top 1000 websites globally.

The GraphQL ecosystem has greatly matured over the last year - and it continues to improve! The community is doing a fantastic job coming up with new abstractions and tools that improve workflows and overall developer experience. A few examples are the GraphQL CLI & graphql-config, GraphQL bindings or the GraphQL Playground. This talk will provide an overview of the different tools and how they fit together when developing GraphQL servers.
