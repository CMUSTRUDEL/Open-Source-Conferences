who's heard the la Bible just cook your

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,580
hands cool this is not gonna be

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,469
embarrassing excellent okay so I'm Jason

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,040
I'm the engineer Margit from the lava

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,259
group

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,940
that's my twitter handle you can send

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,130
abuse questions wherever you'd like to

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,619
it whether I respond is purely how nice

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,750
you are

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:24,029
tweet take photos or free out everything

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,269
is public domain and shareable so

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,760
there's no secrets and what I try to do

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,650
is talk a little bit about where we came

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,690
from in terms of tech as a company we've

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,219
only been around for five years but the

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,530
next five is probably gonna be the most

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,100
interesting for us so brief little

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,800
timeline so we started in 2012 we had a

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,570
Drupal site it was the most shittest

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:52,949
piece of ever it kind of went down

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,260
like every other day so we're very

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,899
quickly after year kind of built a

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,430
node.js Express app that was when nerd

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,510
was really kind of doing picking up

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,450
there was nothing like LTS and for that

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,220
so it's really kind of unstable for in

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,450
fact if you use a blocker this I just

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,689
didn't work so we weren't they happy if

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,240
you blocked ads on our site then we

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,040
moved over to PHP Symphony install in

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,130
2014 you'll notice it's about a year

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,380
space here this is usually because we

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,380
just had a huge growth so by this point

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,600
we probably will around 2 million new

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,060
users a day coming into the site so

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,770
we're kind of grown in 2012 we were

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,869
lucky to have maybe about a thousand

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,860
people so we kind of went on a filter

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,439
directory so the PHP app was pretty good

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,979
had some really complex caching we try

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,350
to make it as performant as possible

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:50,850
then people start doing really stupid

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,030
things on the internet and we went hey

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,759
people like really stupid fingers so we

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,460
kind of grew massively but it took us

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,680
about two years really to actually

00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,380
rebuild the platform mainly because we

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,200
are still trying to keep the site up

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,580
when I could have started the the CEO to

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,780
announce me I said so you're probably

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,330
going to be spending most of your time

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,830
just keeping the site up I thought I was

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,690
a joke

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,220
two hours later thus I was down I again

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,190
thought this was this is training day

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,650
this is like how do I react to this no

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,660
that was my life for six months so I

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,450
said right enough so we built our

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,930
current site using react no Jessie metal

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,820
Smith it's now all subtly generated so

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,280
we don't interact with a dynamic

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,830
database you probably just hit Joe the

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,400
static assets and that's held us quite

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,620
well then graphic you all can came on

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,150
the scene and we've looked at when wow

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,520
this is actually gonna change like our

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,410
world particularly I was by this problem

00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,110
we were well into the Facebook tech

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,240
stack fanboy ISM this was working really

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,520
really well for us so I wanna kind of do

00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,690
is talk to you a little bit about 2018

00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,570
to 2023 that still sounds weird in the

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:08,770
future so couple of challenges that we

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,330
face so content sourcing know we don't

00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,850
get it all if reddit people do actually

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,950
find stuff I'm sick of getting that

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,170
comment over to get off with it

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,470
so by the time it's hit traditional news

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,820
sources it's actually too stale for us

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,500
in order for us to actually get content

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,050
now audience cares about we have to get

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,550
it pretty pretty quick so sourcing is

00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,010
gonna be around how do we understand

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,630
what is relevant our audience is it

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,580
about to go trending so there's cool

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,820
machine learning predictive API

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:40,030
somebody's cell can app distribution so

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,260
as we kind of hit this epoch of apps to

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,459
though we couldn't eat to get our

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,890
content out to as many different places

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,050
as possible so how do we kind of tackle

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,880
that and then intelligence we need to

00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,250
know more about our audience more about

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,770
the content that they like how we can

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,750
help our team improve the way they grab

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,640
hold of that use that personalization

00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,950
all the bits and pieces like that and

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,570
then how do you automate it you know we

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,370
want to be able to do these things as

00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:07,780
quick as possible human beings are slow

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:10,570
machines are fast so solutions so we've

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:14,080
got to do mass video video is a huge

00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:16,450
thing at the moment YouTube Facebook and

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,060
Netflix are probably things you think

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,700
about for video about two years ago you

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,510
probably would a really fine Netflix and

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,430
chill

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,010
so things are kind of like jumped up

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,530
dramatically Instagram introduced

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,290
video probably around 18 months ago and

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,830
that's jumped 40% so all video on

00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,750
Instagram since active jump 40% in use

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,370
and you'll probably spend about 90

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,110
minutes of your life just watching video

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,880
through various different platforms so

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,040
we're going to figure out how do we get

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,570
you looking at our video then we're

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,850
going to personalize the experience so

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,250
this is not kind of a new speed you know

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,830
Facebook styluses how do we reach you on

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,360
a very personal level so VR is a really

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,210
big thing if you think about it that's

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,070
just you and this really big dough I set

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,200
that you've gotta wear but it's gonna be

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,150
a one-on-one experience and if we can

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,590
create an experience that reaches you at

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,150
that level that you want to interact and

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,410
engage with that's something really

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,080
really exciting it's probably to take a

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,180
couple years to get there and we want to

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,460
make everything consistent so you know

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,650
your experience the love Bible doing on

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,240
any different devices could be through

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,580
Alexi it could be for your phone tablet

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,990
TV you should just have a la bible

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,920
experience which is loud

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,580
bossy an in-your-face again some laughs

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,580
like this is quite good

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:34,540
okay so instant delivery as well and has

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,310
anybody heard of instant video no so

00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,320
Facebook have been trialing this out and

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,690
essentially means that the moment you

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,180
see video on your feed it's instantly

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,520
playable so over the next couple years

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,350
video delivery is going to have to kind

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,540
of be the point that we know what type

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,750
of video you like and it almost works

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,250
offline so slowly but surely we're

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,620
getting things like service workers and

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,200
the ability to have offline first

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,240
experiences that's just for content in

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,190
terms of reading demo text maybe images

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,500
videos probably be the next thing for

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,230
that so we're really plan ahead for that

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,940
I wanted to kind of give you a little

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,960
brief overview about how our system

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,850
coming looks so we've got a graph QL fun

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,900
here's the schema then we've got a REST

00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:22,050
API personalization engine video in

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,580
terms of kind of a small dam system

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,670
we've got what we call the submissions

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,970
platform so we go around 5,000 videos

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:33,490
each day sent to us via Facebook a few

00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,030
different sources they all live there

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,730
and they get put through in

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:42,540
the news feed into our and then articles

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,920
can work with our CMS what we wanted to

00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,230
be able to do as mentioned is kind of

00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,210
like distribute content to different

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,210
places and kind of grow out some of the

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,220
brands so you may know on this grub we

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,380
might have the lens Bible the travel

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,810
Bible Facebook we've got the gaming

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:02,010
Bible pre 52 is our female kind of

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,630
magazine style and then spot so the

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,740
question is what do we do if we want to

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:10,530
kind of duplicate this but then rebrand

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:15,210
it for a different channel so this could

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,740
be sport so it's completely identical to

00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,060
don't have experience on there but like

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,370
I said we want to make it consistent we

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,050
want to make it so that you experience

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,140
our content in the same way and that

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,150
works for our brands as well then

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,010
someone decides you know what the video

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,300
system you've got needs to be a little

00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:33,030
bit more advanced so we need to actually

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,410
get a proper damn system so now what can

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,030
we do now we're in a situation where

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,430
this isn't going to come out work the

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:42,050
same way and we've kind of tried to make

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:44,580
some decisions about how this works here

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,610
so we kind of decide well we should

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,950
micro service this so now we've got two

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,250
services one is for articles one is for

00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:55,830
video but then how they're going to

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,720
connect you know so as we can we're

00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,250
already seeing about schema stitching so

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,170
this is where this comes in this is

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,210
really exciting for us because it means

00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,640
that we can use something like ground so

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,650
we can use something like graph QL

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,500
bindings to be able to kind of bring

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,910
these few schemas together so that gives

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,760
us something like this which is known as

00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,220
a gateway API what this essentially

00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,370
means is that this here only has one

00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,760
schema and that is composed by these two

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:26,970
services so this has no functionality at

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,670
all it is just basically a dumb box if

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,080
you kind of familiar with nginx you know

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,660
how that works where dispatches file

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,180
presents that out it's a similar way

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,250
it's just kind of hitting the schema and

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,740
then that resolves it and it decides how

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,180
you want video so you're not going to go

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,070
there you want video so you gonna go

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,980
here or you want articles you're going

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,190
to go here I just kind of pumps up back

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,190
up

00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,339
so this scheme is going to look a little

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:54,889
bit like this

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,990
so each one of our brands we call a

00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:59,990
channel so this could be love Bibles spa

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,910
Bible or pre 50t we've got our services

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:05,089
and subscribers articles so you can say

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,639
I want the first 10 skip the first 10 a

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,740
limit to 100 and I want them all from

00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,779
yesterday and that will return you all

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,399
of our articles essentially the first 10

00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:21,470
20 in that make sense for the pagination

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:23,389
and then the site of the app LX a Syria

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:27,079
wherever it is can then actually use

00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:32,779
that information some way and then

00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:34,009
likewise for video so it's a little bit

00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,529
overkill for somebody because I think a

00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:38,029
few of you guys might know a little bit

00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:41,029
more graphic it might be a bit new but

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:42,290
it's kind of a language agnostic so it

00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:44,839
doesn't know what programming language

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,519
that you use which is great when you're

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,470
sundew microservices trying to figure

00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,899
out how different parts of your system

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,509
can actually communicate together one

00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:55,129
thing that we have which was a little

00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,079
bit of challenge at first was we've got

00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:59,600
the video platform is written in PHP

00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,939
some of our more new stuff is in

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,220
typescript and then we've got a video

00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:05,509
transcoding service bingo they all need

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,600
to communicate with each other they all

00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:11,600
share information so we looked at grcc

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,920
we looked at basic web hooks and all the

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,220
kinds of ways of communicating back and

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,949
forth statuses but then we actually

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,420
started setting up things like graph QL

00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:21,519
schemas between the two and I just meant

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,339
Phineas were a little bit more uniform

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,680
so as soon as you've resolved your

00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:29,809
schema it doesn't really matter what the

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,709
languages that you implement in order to

00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:35,809
use that so let's go back to this

00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:38,449
example so if you've got a sponsored

00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:41,449
video as someone decides we all wish you

00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:46,279
start doing polls so we then update our

00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:47,720
schema and we can now do polls what we

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,569
can then do is we can write the

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,879
micro-service or however way we wish to

00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:56,420
do this to actually provide those polls

00:10:52,879 --> 00:11:00,620
by a topic the beauty of this as well is

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:02,390
the client so react or it could even be

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,130
you know a custom interface you've

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,650
written yourself maybe it's just a

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,140
back-end service or front-end service if

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:12,110
you don't want to support poles you

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,610
don't have to but if you want to allow

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,010
poles and you want to be able to present

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,830
those in some way you can implement the

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:23,920
schema and the resolver and you'll then

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:28,160
be able to fetch that so schemas involve

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:32,390
so who here knows about REST API or

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,630
heard of them great so you guys probably

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,890
know that you would version an api i've

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:40,310
decided in the field

00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,840
1.1 you know the convention with

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:45,740
graphical is that you don't they should

00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:48,650
evolve so i change content title to

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,060
short content title i wouldn't replace

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,490
title i would actually just add a new

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,990
field what this also means is if you go

00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,320
back to this kind of example here is

00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,300
that if at some point we go up pulse was

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,550
a really bad idea let's not continue

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,410
doing that what we can actually do is we

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,450
can slowly sunset this feature without

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,400
breaking anything so the schema will

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,080
still exist but what it is we'll just

00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,120
choose on the client side not to handle

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,370
that resolve i'm not fed to that feature

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,640
it and there may be a couple of months

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:19,940
from now we'll just forget it ever

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,580
happened and the service can actually

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,580
just wind down slowly particularly if

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,560
you're DevOps team or you using

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,570
something blue-green which is where you

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,030
just switch out new services with the

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,770
existing and then you kind of build up

00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:37,060
traffic from one to the other

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:39,230
over time as it's in demand

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,990
subscriptions so we want to be able to

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,580
get content to you straight away one way

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,540
of doing that is actually by pushing

00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:49,310
content out to you so there's HTTP two

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,710
which allows you to push assets and sup

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,690
to the client but subscriptions can also

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:57,170
create a one to one as well so things

00:12:53,690 --> 00:13:00,590
like background fetch service workers

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:02,920
and I believe elector ease dude

00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,750
something allows you to prefetch content

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,430
like alarm systems stuff like that but

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,250
subscriptions will mean that if we

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,480
create a new article or a new video we

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,490
can push that straight to the client or

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,689
we go oh you like videos of cats

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,339
so what we're going to do is going to

00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:17,929
allow you to have instant video and

00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,269
we'll just push that to your client and

00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:21,170
it'll do some day in the background and

00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:27,110
subscriptions will allow us to do that

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:28,699
so I always kind of like to leave my

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,910
presentations with a little bit of like

00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:33,319
a message a sense so Peter Drucker once

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,809
said the best way to predict the future

00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:37,610
is to create it and that's kind of a

00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:40,100
thing that we believe in the lab our

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,600
engineering team is that we want to be

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,399
able to create the future that we want

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,079
and not stick with what we've got

00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,459
so you can see that for our content for

00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,629
the way that we approach code and

00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:51,949
technical problems stuff like that I

00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:54,259
hope that's a little bit of a whirlwind

00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:56,179
tour if anyone's got any questions that

00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:59,329
is my Twitter handle I'm around this

00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:01,780
evening do you ask this was a quick

00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:07,350
Warren - but thank you

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:07,350
