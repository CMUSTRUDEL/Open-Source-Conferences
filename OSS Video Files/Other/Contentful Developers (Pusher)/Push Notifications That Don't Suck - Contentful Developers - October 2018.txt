Publication date: 2018-11-13
Playlist: Contentful Developers
Description: 
	Presented by Zan Markan.

In the age where apps in every category battle it out against each other for conversion rates and session times, push notifications have become the de-facto way to generate repeat visits and therefore hitting those all-important KPIs. The end result? Billions of people annoyed by irrelevant notifications which are generally ignored. I believe we can do better.

This talk covers tips and tricks for better user targeting, showing relevant content, as well as styling them using the latest and greatest of Oreoâ€™s APIs and best practices.
