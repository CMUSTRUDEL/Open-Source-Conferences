Title: Push Notifications That Don't Suck - Contentful Developers - October 2018
Publication date: 2018-11-13
Playlist: Contentful Developers
Description: 
	Presented by Zan Markan.

In the age where apps in every category battle it out against each other for conversion rates and session times, push notifications have become the de-facto way to generate repeat visits and therefore hitting those all-important KPIs. The end result? Billions of people annoyed by irrelevant notifications which are generally ignored. I believe we can do better.

This talk covers tips and tricks for better user targeting, showing relevant content, as well as styling them using the latest and greatest of Oreoâ€™s APIs and best practices.

from pusher I do Deverell here and we're

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,660
really glad to have you here and this is

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,029
our first ever meet up in this new

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,520
office which is really cool yeah thanks

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,900
to have this opportunity to give a talk

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,789
lightning talk about a topic that I'm

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,070
really fond of it's push notifications

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:33,059
and UX surrounded push notifications and

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,950
how to make them suck less so before I

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:39,300
begin I want to say a couple of words of

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,059
what we do here we make real-time api's

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,239
that make a bunch of apps dance

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,620
basically as a matter of fact I'm pretty

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,360
sure there are several apps in your

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,090
pockets in your phones in your pockets

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,640
right now when we're powering the

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:58,620
real-time features of those apps and

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,829
yeah we make all sorts of products and

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,799
our one of our newer products which

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,400
we're very soon to releasing is called

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,040
chat kit and I'm really excited for it

00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,799
if you need a messaging API that makes

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,020
very few assumptions about how you want

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,000
to build your app and what you want to

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,470
put in it be it one-to-one group chat

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,340
that kind of stuff chat kit might be the

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,350
thing to to use matter of fact to see it

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,740
in action we have it we're hosting a

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,600
meet-up next year that's next week same

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,570
time same place

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,659
basically on Tuesday about it so if you

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,990
want to learn more please come and let's

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,829
talk about it basically yeah but now

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,490
let's talk about push notifications

00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:51,060
let's face it a lot of notifications

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:56,280
they're kind of useless

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,979
I mean sales really most people I know

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,310
don't really just dismiss them and don't

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,290
really pay attention or maybe if you get

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,649
too many of those you might disable the

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,440
notifications for this app or if they

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,520
get really annoying you might just

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,990
uninstall the app and stop using the

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,860
service altogether and

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:22,260
or what we call in marketing lingo is

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,170
basically gonna churn which is bad but

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,060
airlines are obviously not the only ones

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,820
you got their games anyone plays their

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,450
games they have chests and loot boxes

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,360
and reward boxes and they come every 24

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,860
hours and every week and you get a nice

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,150
little push notification telling you hey

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,370
something is waiting for you

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:46,590
you got a rare reward coming for you and

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,390
surely the best way to tell someone that

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,760
something shiny is waiting for them is

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:55,800
to send them a push and more you have

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,480
them more games you have the more of

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,120
those notifications you're gonna be

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,980
receiving more often and they're

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,800
probably the worst offenders even worse

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,020
than shopping and airline apps but the

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,260
unfortunate truth is that pretty much

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,170
every single industry has them social

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,090
media say shopping delivery

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,750
we're just bombarded with those

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,310
notifications I mentioned Airlines

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,860
already but here they are again

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:27,090
easyJet you're probably familiar with

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,130
this one yeah I mean they do let their

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,920
marketing department hit their

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,690
performance targets and they just send

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,160
blanket push notifications to millions

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:40,410
of people with advertisement so that

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,920
they sell more more seats but on the

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,370
other hand

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,870
easyJet also does things like this they

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,640
tell you if you're in the airport

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,290
waiting for your flight they tell you

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,060
hey you have to go to gate 2022 a or

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,890
they show you your boarding pass in a

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,220
notification so you're super easily

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,990
accessible and that is like what the

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,000
other side of the spectrum is super

00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:10,080
useful and hard to believe yeah this

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,660
hyper contextual super targeted really

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,580
contextually relevant notification for

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,310
you come from the same app come from the

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:21,600
same team and are built with more or

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,850
less the same technologies but why do we

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,000
have the first type of notifications the

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:30,270
annoying ones the reality is there

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,570
actually work they kind of push the

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,670
needle and ever-so-slightly the numbers

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,640
will improve when you send something and

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,800
more people will open your app and eff

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,700
more people open your app more people

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,740
will make a purchase and job done just

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,800
send more of those and we all go home

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,440
with a nice Christmas bonus I've worked

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,550
in retail and it's not too far from the

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,830
truth so yeah I mean there's science to

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,740
confirm why this works unfortunately the

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,720
way pushes work is they give us a

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,020
constant stream of mini rewards the

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,960
boxes there are many bits of

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,820
gratification just randomly popping up

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,150
all the time just open this up and

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,190
you'll see something amazing look what I

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,040
have in store for you maybe an item

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,800
you're you were looking at is on sale or

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:27,120
something you've searched for is running

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,790
out of stock just something these are

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:35,940
the actions that are designed to trigger

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:39,300
addictions designs to design to just

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:42,150
make some cheap marketing tricks to make

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,330
sales it doesn't really help anyone so

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:50,640
it doesn't help your users so if you

00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:53,820
want to get from here to here just pay

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,940
attention and let's figure out what how

00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,390
to make the notification Rock instead of

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:05,280
sock the first step you need to do take

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:08,100
is to ask yourself do I need to send a

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,370
push notification and then you follow

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:19,380
this really simple handy guide made by

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:23,550
your friends it's slack yeah so this is

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,770
an actual diagram a flowchart from slack

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,470
how to make a decision whether to send a

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:31,530
notification at the beginning a question

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:34,680
should we send one and then you go

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:37,620
through 20 30 questions follow-up

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,729
questions until you come to either yes

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,729
or a no and

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,530
the thing is they take a bunch of stuff

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,379
under consideration and they get two

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:52,289
things really well first one is

00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:54,599
personalization different devices that

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:57,180
you have they might have different rules

00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:59,849
maybe you like notifications to come on

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,280
desktop but not on your phone maybe you

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:05,129
don't want them on your iPad or maybe

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,719
you want them in some channels and you

00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,789
really don't want them in most other

00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:12,930
channels mmm

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:16,050
but the point is you set everything in

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,629
your app slack gives you this

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,080
opportunity to set everything based on

00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:23,819
your preferences and that's key and on

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,689
the other thing on the other thing it

00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,819
gets right is the context slack knows a

00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:33,150
lot they know everything from your

00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:36,599
current time zone to the device that you

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:40,319
are using and it's all based on on these

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:41,819
factors and more obviously and then they

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,159
only decide whether to send a

00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,979
notification and even when they decide

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,110
to send it they decide whether it's a

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:53,699
high priority notification or if it's a

00:07:49,110 --> 00:08:00,150
low priority notification so so yeah in

00:07:53,699 --> 00:08:02,370
a nutshell beer be like slack so the

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,680
other thing you need to worry about when

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,259
when you're making great notification

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,210
experiences is you want to be using the

00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,930
latest and greatest that the platforms

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:17,370
that you're targeting offer so if you're

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:20,250
building for mobile yeah you have all

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:23,250
the opportunities to to modify sounds to

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,139
modify the type of notification the the

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,490
the if you want to show an image you

00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,680
wanna you want to show something on the

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,779
lockscreen you wanna you want to make it

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,659
high priority low priority you want to

00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,610
group notifications all of that takes

00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:38,490
into take that into account and make

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,539
that into into something that makes

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:48,690
sense for your current use case and your

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:50,940
users use case next make it work I mean

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,760
by that I mean if you're doing deep

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,600
linking a lot of sale apps they don't

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,519
really do deeply

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,130
right so they say some nighttime is on

00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,050
sale but you click on it and it takes

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,720
you to the home screen because they've

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,899
missed they've messed up their state

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:13,560
management basically even more

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:18,389
importantly don't crash and lastly don't

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:22,980
test in production this from Jack Dorsey

00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:27,029
he's the CEO of Twitter and this was two

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,589
weeks ago basically and yeah the last

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:33,660
point I want to Train I want to make

00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:36,930
here is both iOS and Android they have

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:41,730
recently really pushed for wellbeing of

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:45,959
users so they both have given the users

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:50,009
the opportunity to set their own

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:51,690
preferences to to tell their devices

00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,319
what they actually want and this is

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:59,790
because of all the bad user experience

00:09:54,319 --> 00:10:01,290
that apps have been churning out you can

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,089
