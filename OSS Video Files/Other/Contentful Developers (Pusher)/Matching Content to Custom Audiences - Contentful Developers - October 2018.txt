	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,260
our topic today is matching content to

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:13,710
custom audiences and up introduce us

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,220
first so hello from Helsinki we are from

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,350
company called frosmo that actually is a

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,650
digital experience management platform

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,320
and we are headquartered in Helsinki but

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,099
we also have an office here in London

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:34,950
and one in Barcelona Stockholm also and

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:39,149
Manila America our platform training

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,670
manager and also technical project

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,050
manager and contentful specialist at

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,600
frosmo I'm going to say a few words

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,739
about Fresno and what does the platform

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,870
- so we work on three areas where the

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,469
first one is with the data driven

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:59,460
development in front end using well

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:02,370
frameworks like reacts then data

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,820
tracking and AI modeling so basically

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,090
feeding in data from for example your

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,369
CRM or other data sources and then

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,850
combining that with behavioral data

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,549
track from the website then putting it

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,640
to some AI model to enrich the data and

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,700
then returning for example things like

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,270
if the visitor is about to churn or not

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,180
so like predictive models of what should

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,400
happen next to your website visitors and

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,920
then the third thing that we're focusing

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,060
on mainly today is experience

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:43,350
optimization so that being online

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:46,350
testing personalization and product or

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,360
content recommendations I might want to

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,759
ask in the beginning like how many of

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,649
you have already touched the experience

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:58,350
optimization doing some may be testing

00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:02,310
personalization for our recommendations

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,719
such cool like half of the audience

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,719
please okay

00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,530
I want to give you a quick glance of how

00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,930
our platform works in a very simple

00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:18,780
manner so we work through a JavaScript

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:22,480
tag that is on the website and then that

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,620
queries either content or pushes data to

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,830
our back-end and then we have graphical

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:37,080
you I called frosmo control panel that

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:41,770
you can then do all your adjustments in

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:44,440
and how do we proceed tonight we have

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:48,220
like really basic problem solution

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,310
scenario and then Jana will then present

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,340
the technical side of how things were

00:02:51,310 --> 00:03:00,700
done and then at the end if you have any

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:05,380
questions or Frank the problem that we

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:08,430
are trying to solve is how to meet the

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,010
expectations of a busy website visitor

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:15,360
first thing is that of course like

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,830
services like Google Netflix Facebook

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,700
they are kind of like setting the bar

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,959
for all of us so I guess everyone has

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,880
been using at least one of those

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,750
services yeah they are heavily

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:32,070
personalized they use AI to provide

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:36,610
relevant content to the visitor then

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:38,080
that's well that's the normal so then we

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:43,780
need to be there as well with all of our

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,250
services and then on top of this are our

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,780
visitors are not that easy because also

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,980
the attention span has decreased

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,940
significantly late in the past years so

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,920
everything has to be there immediately

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,580
so you need to bring the relevant

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,530
content to the visitor almost the first

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,760
goal when they launch the website your

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:06,190
service and then though I bet everyone

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,430
in this room loves to work with the

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:12,790
front-end frameworks and with the

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,460
separated front-end these frameworks

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,769
don't provide any built-in tools for

00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,889
doing personally say

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:25,819
or experience optimization so you kind

00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:31,530
of have to find it from someone and uh

00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:35,400
what we think is the solution for this

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,470
issue that's personalization so first of

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,169
all you're all I think halfway there

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:47,250
because you have chosen contentful which

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:50,550
is your content in a structured form so

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,220
you can trade it programmatically so you

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,259
can start actually doing some kind of

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,090
personalization over there and you like

00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,569
thinking okay what content should fit

00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:04,020
for which visitors the other side of it

00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:08,130
is that the user experience should also

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:12,680
change change based on the visitors

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:16,319
behavior so you combine the content and

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:21,050
your website components for each

00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:24,389
individual and because I'm a teacher I

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,300
like to show things simply oh in a

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,400
simple manner so this is one code one

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,520
content so one solution fits all you

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,990
have your content model all your default

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,650
content that goes to everyone on the

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,620
website over here you have your

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:44,370
front-end code you combine those but if

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:48,050
you want to personalize need to do

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:51,300
something else you need to have

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:54,300
variations of content if we take for

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,719
example Yanni and myself yoni is the

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,120
developer he's interested in in

00:05:56,719 --> 00:06:02,460
development related content I'm

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,699
interested in well educational content

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,979
or something else so we are different

00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,039
types of visitors if we think of like a

00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:13,199
blog like all the blog posts that

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,120
website has and if we want to create

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,990
this kind of highlight that highlights

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,990
different blog posts that item shouldn't

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:25,190
highlight the same blog post to me that

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,190
what it should highlight so yani

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:31,969
then if we think it the other way around

00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:35,270
we can have one default content so the

00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:37,159
most-viewed blog posts for example but

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,550
then we can be different types of

00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:42,469
visitors in the sense that I prefer

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:45,740
browsing like a ListView the only

00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:51,919
prefers grid view to seeing the visuals

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:55,819
and such yet again we have like place to

00:06:51,919 --> 00:07:00,229
personalise now just with the targeted

00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:02,389
code if we combine you have yet again

00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:05,740
someone can start doing the math more

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:10,399
and more there are well can human really

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,740
do this anymore I think now it's time to

00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,779
hunt hand over to you so you can explain

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,879
what we have been doing how can you

00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:19,699
achieve the personalization well first

00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:23,210
of all obviously you need your audiences

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:24,469
you need a way to detect audiences so it

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,559
really clicked as example of the

00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:31,909
developer kind of like a teacher like

00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:34,279
how do you know which is which and like

00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,919
you have to kind of lock in your website

00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:40,399
you have to define the rules where how

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,620
do you protect those users and basically

00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,439
the other important part is what

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,240
audiences are important for you what

00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:52,099
kind of what kind of audience you want

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,469
to build okay then the next part is Pepe

00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:57,709
you add the audience talk attacks to

00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:59,809
content and thanks to context for it's

00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:01,759
actually really easy because you have

00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:04,909
that flexibility in the content models

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,800
you can add a field there I feel here

00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:09,379
that's clear just right there

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,870
say this is for developer this is for

00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:15,620
sales person it is for some other of the

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:18,529
user so then you can have this kind of

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,330
one-to-one mapping of course that's one

00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:24,589
way you can have a one-to-many mappings

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,209
as well if you want then obviously you

00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:30,229
have to create your you are component

00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:33,310
variations and those who are component

00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:36,169
variations need to know which kind of

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:38,060
audiences to show to and which kind of

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,760
content you want to show in that you are

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,030
component and when you can combine all

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,220
these

00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,220
your personalization is basically ready

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:55,830
so let's see how frosmo toggles testing

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:58,140
so we have pasted a tour of like three

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,360
rolls we have the content creator who's

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,700
using the content full then we at the

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,610
bottom we have the frontal developer he

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,260
is developing the code and then we have

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,990
some kind of e-commerce manager or

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,970
business manager who actually wants to

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,490
make the decision that this is the user

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:21,690
that we want to show this condom or this

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:26,220
code variation so yeah with this this in

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:29,340
mind let's go to an example some really

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,920
simple like one code multiple content

00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,620
variations so on the left side here we

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,450
have the non targeted content basically

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:42,050
that meant for everyone on the site or

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:45,390
users who are not yet in any specific

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,730
target group or audience then on the

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,170
right side we have two targeted content

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:55,880
variations we have something for

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:59,010
developers something for our partners so

00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,770
what we need to do in order to get that

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,500
is set up well obviously we need those

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,990
two audiences developers and partners in

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,470
fro small audiences is called segments

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,670
so we're segmenting users then you need

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,900
to have those content models in

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:19,230
contentful if we go back a bit we can

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:22,620
see that what we have done here is if we

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,270
will have a one big content model called

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,170
a highlight block and then we have a

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:30,570
three separate items here so basically

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:35,430
just really simple example with two

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:38,820
content awesome yeah then you need that

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:41,850
UI component here it can be reacting to

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,310
be angular whatever you want you have to

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,410
use that audience tagging to first

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,900
convert from condom floor and most

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,240
importantly we wanted that ecommerce

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:55,560
manager to be able to control what is

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,510
shown and to whom so you as a developer

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:02,190
don't need to come for a car to code

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:05,010
anything in your code so let's see first

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,380
the content for content models so on the

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:10,140
left side here is highlighted the

00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,090
audience tagging so we have a UI

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,910
extension for that one it's just pulling

00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:17,460
all the audiences so for some segments

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,160
and there's the list of lists of the

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,740
segment's there it's it's a frost away

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,780
but obviously you can do it in content

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,190
full you just add a field and if you

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,500
have some custom or the answers then you

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,920
can add it there or you have some custom

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,780
solution no so we have just basically

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,910
two to audience is developed partner and

00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:41,010
then we have that known so we don't have

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:43,620
any any chorus then we need to pass that

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:47,460
target audience to the code so basically

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:51,000
you have to refactor or think a bit how

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,970
you can reuse your component so in the

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,980
left side there's a pros more UI where

00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,370
you actually can't just pass any data as

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,900
a JSON to your code so in this case

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,780
we're just passing this frozen segment

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,720
we're saying that it's a partner and

00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:09,390
here in your code you're using your

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:16,110
react component and it's just passed as

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:19,380
a property there the audience when kind

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,510
of like it's past there it then you can

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,300
do anything with that one in this case

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:27,839
we're just calling the connect tool with

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:30,180
this property so it's quite simple here

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,750
you can build basically more complex

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,480
solutions if you want and kind of like

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,030
this then the way that actual the

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,020
e-commerce manager can manage the

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:44,640
content from frosmo control panel

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:49,530
telling what what kind of content he

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:51,300
wants in that component so to complete

00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,420
and summarize that one

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,970
so frosmo identifies the user as a

00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:01,680
partner user and basically passes that

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:03,120
partner audience to the code and then

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,630
call requests contentful

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,120
with that partner audience and then it's

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:16,790
it's return back and the code

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,790
displaced or renders the layout okay

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:27,120
experience optimization completely

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:29,700
personal taste right well maybe not what

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,250
if this is the case you actually want to

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:36,870
go from these audiences to fully

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:43,170
personalized what what we do then we

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:45,540
have let's say a 100 layout 1000 content

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,610
variations there you just let's say a

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,750
lot of products you have a use product

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,339
you want to match these products with

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,080
with the user that you want or some

00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:58,560
other other content it doesn't really

00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:03,210
matter so there's just limit for this

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:06,360
audience approach the solid rocky human

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:10,890
can still manage it is it like 20 30 50

00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:13,050
there's limit for that one so what good

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,400
thing is better to here at you have

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,650
already attacked your content you have

00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,839
created the personalization so then you

00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:21,390
just want to go from this audiences to

00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:25,260
actually individuals so individual

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:31,279
personalization but thankfully it's not

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:35,279
the topic for this day so I'm not gonna

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:39,480
use your time for that one so if you

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:42,870
wanna know more then you can visit that

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,390
one to see how form works with content

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,720
for or if you have any questions you can
