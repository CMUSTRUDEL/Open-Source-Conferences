Publication date: 2018-11-13
Playlist: Contentful Developers
Description: 
	Presented by James Sear.

James will discuss how to keep content flexible by breaking it down into blocks, which can be added to larger assemblies, using a static site built with Contentful and Gatsby as an example.

what we're going to try and do is focus

00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,359
on the the difficulties that we had in

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,550
order to try and facilitate a

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,590
conversation between you know us us in

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,799
the community hopefully you'll get

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,080
something out of the the stuff that we

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,390
did the problems that we solved but also

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,710
if you've got any tips as to how we

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,250
might kind of improve things in the

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:27,840
future you know we're very open to that

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:30,260
so this talk in particular is to

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,640
highlight the kind of difficulties with

00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,500
the the project we worked on had some

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,190
business constraints which that which

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,960
actually made a difference to how we

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,670
were building our content models within

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,219
content for and I think it's quite a

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,379
weird situation that we found ourselves

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,320
in but effectively you know how the

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,879
business were little work was defining

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,800
how we were going to build content

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,910
models and I don't think that's really

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,340
talked about too much

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,489
we work for MMD digital just very quick

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,350
plug whilst we're here so MMD digital

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:04,799
we're a design and build agency located

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,610
in the Midlands and in London we build

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,090
small to large scale systems for various

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,670
clients Vodafone compare the market

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,610
Baccardi but the list kind of goes on

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,670
really generally web-based stuff so you

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,680
know as a whole we build websites

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:27,960
effectively so for many years we've used

00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,860
CMS systems so we know how CMS systems

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,380
work pretty well but we've kind of

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,350
always used these monolith CMS systems

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,630
where like you get like everything you

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,130
know in the box ready so you can use all

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,560
these features and sell these features

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,149
to your clients and over the years we've

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,720
kind of found that the features are

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,909
never quite what we wanted so we end up

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,829
like building on top and and then we get

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,070
locked into this this big system so

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,380
obviously contempo was really kind of

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,020
promising for us in that respect this

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,820
project came up and we decided that this

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,320
was the perfect kind of candidate but

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,770
for us to try and decoupled approach

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,420
with our content infrastructure so yeah

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,250
that's that's how we kind of got onto

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:16,360
content for a award-winning

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:20,800
so that's the plug so moving on to the

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,530
project then so the project was for a

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,420
sub brand of Travis Perkins so within

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:30,400
the kind of building sort of sphere so

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,410
quite quite a big brand quite a small

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,260
budget which is kind of a common story

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:39,790
really for us which is unfortunate but

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:44,140
their current website was extremely

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,670
dated they this is pretty much the most

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,820
hilarious thing about it to manage their

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,990
content when we kind of met them for the

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,350
first time they were using an a/b

00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,930
testing tool so they would change their

00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,660
content and put the slider a hundred

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,250
percent over to the B side so when you

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,500
load the website you get the old content

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:07,540
and then JavaScript kicks in and you get

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,190
the new content so quite ingenious from

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,680
the content editor perspective but also

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,860
a terrible experience and just terrible

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,720
in in every way really so you know we

00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,730
decided that we wanted to something

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,110
about that at least the bar was low when

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:25,660
well when we came in which is great so a

00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,200
really quick kind of rundown of sort of

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,510
what they wanted a high level so am

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,769
flexible marketing content we often

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,550
build marketing pages for clients and

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,100
ideally what they want is they want

00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,690
something that they can keep using over

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,100
you know months and years they want a

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,080
page that they can build and they can

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,700
reorder it and they can move components

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,040
in different in different places and

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,600
just the content editor can just go nuts

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,080
and and make it look good within the

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,450
constraints of a theme so that's what we

00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,239
wanted to give them effectively

00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:01,660
there was a products page which was kind

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,890
of like an e-commerce thing but there

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,480
was no payment there was no

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,820
transactional element to it so it was

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,160
just like I want to hire this thing you

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,239
know here's my request for the hire of

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,769
that and then a couple more kind of

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,620
features in there so branch locator that

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,870
was all CMS managed and then and then a

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,340
decoupled search I kind of gloss over

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,770
that like it's like it's nothing that's

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,060
a massive thing but um but we're not

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,410
going to get onto that in this talk but

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,390
it was kind of one of those require

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,190
I think it's feeding into the bigger

00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:33,190
picture now of how we're having to build

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:36,490
websites you know lots of kind of open

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:40,660
questions there from us the team to

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:43,810
build this was - devs so small team and

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,380
then some guidance roles that we have

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:50,980
mmt so architects and infrastructure

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:54,100
guys scrum masters product owners etc so

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,500
we had a scrum team basically we had

00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,010
four Sprint's to do it for two weeks

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:04,050
prints so eight weeks from nothing -

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:07,120
ready to deploy and this was our first

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:11,380
static site that will go into production

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,270
and our first contempo site so our two

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,060
Deb's James being one of them

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,920
and another guy called Tom plenty of

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,880
react experience so we were fine there

00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:25,000
but no can temple experience at all and

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:30,390
no gas be experienced in this case so

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,390
some unknowns but also some some knowns

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,430
so first of all I apologize for the

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,600
greyscale wires and they're a little bit

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,400
boring to look at but this kind of

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,700
branding implication there I can't show

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,280
the official design which kind of comes

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,630
along with enterprise clients but um

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,220
this is the landing page not really much

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,710
to talk about here it's a standard

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:54,360
marketing landing page it has content it

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:57,430
has zones it has heroes it has

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,900
signposting the key thing here is they

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,820
needed to be able to build this page in

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,610
any order however they wanted so you

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,780
know just move it all around and build

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,180
these so we needed to build these

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:11,770
components as developers so they could

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:13,240
throw it together how they wanted the

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,050
product page as I mentioned earlier

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,750
looks pretty much like an e-commerce

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,830
product page really apart from the fact

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,860
you're not actually going through and

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,690
purchasing anything and you can see we

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:30,340
have product information we have

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:32,890
metadata about the product we had kind

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,890
of deeper you can see here product

00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,479
variations and kind of deeper

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,310
specification details so that was a

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,330
content modeling

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,580
that's something we had to really think

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:51,110
about on how to kind of model this this

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:54,080
data so we kind of before we before we

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,300
get got stuck in there and we did just

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,650
like go and build some stuff first just

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,830
to kind of get our teeth into content

00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,599
fill and Gatsby but we tried to model

00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,080
some of this stuff using entity

00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:09,199
relationship diagrams so our first tip

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,610
outwards to everyone is to start getting

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,430
into entity relationship diagrams

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,509
because they're a really good way of

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,210
communicating how you're going to model

00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:20,360
something you know without having to

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,159
show code but still being quite specific

00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,110
you can see the lines here have certain

00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:26,120
meanings and stuff and it's not hard to

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,680
learn but it's actually really useful to

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,389
have conversations with clients and

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,569
developers and all be on on the same

00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:34,729
page so the two things we're going to

00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,979
talk about modeling here is that the top

00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:39,560
row which is our landing template which

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,780
for the first design you saw and then

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,020
the bottom row which is our products

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:49,610
page which we'll move on to that a

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:52,340
little bit later so just to preface this

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,960
so it doesn't sound like super negative

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,849
because it's not a negative thing we're

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,440
just sharing the the true difficulties

00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:59,210
we had we talked about all the things

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,139
that we loved about building with

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:07,580
content for so the the backend

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:09,680
interfaces is amazing it's really clean

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,229
it's really client friendly handing it

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,909
over to a client is a pleasure and

00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,449
that's something we haven't had in the

00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:20,960
past usually it's pretty clunky from an

00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:23,270
experience point of view the use of user

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,310
permissions stuff with Incan temple is

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,080
very very simple and stripped back and

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,629
we found that to be an advantage as

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,620
opposed to a disadvantage generally user

00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:36,560
permissions stuff within CMS systems is

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,659
pretty horrible and even as a dev you

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:43,760
don't quite know who's got permission to

00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:45,620
do what its content pool just feels like

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,120
it's from a development background it

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,779
feels like it's ready for developers to

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,120
get going

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,130
you heard you know the graph QL stuff

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,389
that's kind of music to developers ears

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,880
really

00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:58,130
so we felt that as we were developing

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,350
all the API Doc's just just kind of

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,350
played into into the whole ecosystem for

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,440
us support for environments which is

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,480
quite a new thing of Incan temple this

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,620
is an absolute necessity for us we deal

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,690
with enterprise clients and they

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,459
wouldn't give us another look if we

00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,779
couldn't provide some sort of support

00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:16,399
for them to have a QA in a staging

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:19,100
environment even if they don't fully

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,910
understand what it is it needs to be

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,730
there as a feature to check the box and

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,560
also because we're a partner with

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,570
content where we do have some contact

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,310
with the solutions architects there but

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,410
also we did just reach out for support

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,970
on the general website you know just

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,130
within the kind of intercom chat in the

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,510
bottom just like they were trying to do

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,860
this thing can you help us out and the

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,850
support was like amazing we received so

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:50,230
really happy with all that stuff and

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:52,339
unloads more so the challenges then and

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,310
for this one I'm going to start by

00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:57,440
handing over to James okay so one of the

00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,810
main problems we had was trying to

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,100
develop a content model strategy when we

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,040
were limited by the amount of cognitive

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,269
models we had available so the client

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,790
only actually had the budget for the

00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:10,130
large contentful space so we only had 48

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,839
to play with and the main problem being

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:15,380
that we found out about this midway

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:18,350
through development so initially this is

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,899
a slimmed down version of how we

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,670
approach the sort of content builder

00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,920
sort of site builders part of our

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,709
website so we're starting off with the

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,380
template and a template always has a

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:32,089
relationship field called blocks now

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,069
there are a lot of templates which

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:37,220
allowed for blocks like home template

00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:39,560
category template landing template but

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,019
they always have these blocks and our

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,889
idea of blocks was that the croc the the

00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:47,800
client could create and reuse blocks to

00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:50,449
sort of build out all their pages and

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,550
it's effectively a row but we decided to

00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:54,230
call it a block instead of a row because

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,639
if we ever wanted to reuse the blocks

00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,220
seeing a mobile app or anything like

00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,819
that the content might be vertical not

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,680
horizontal so went with blocks and the

00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:05,890
idea behind a block is that it contains

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,440
one too many components

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,860
now we went for this approach for a

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,110
number of reasons the one of them being

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,500
that we could define exactly which

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,870
components for inside a block we could

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,250
create blocks that have spots for

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,870
multiple different components if you

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,930
want to which makes it a lot easier for

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:29,350
rendering in Gatsby it means we can

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:31,990
apply styles and elements and metadata

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,420
to to the block and affect all different

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,540
components but the main idea was to just

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,820
create sort of this abstracted layer so

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,980
if we encourage our clients to enter

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,079
their content in just these small little

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:47,290
components we can reuse them throughout

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,510
the site so the client had a contact

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,269
block with their contact component with

00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:54,519
the sales team in and that was used

00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:57,550
basically everywhere but the time got to

00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,019
it and they needed to change the data

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,070
and they only had to change it in one

00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:05,500
area this is also the kind of work for

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,589
this approach as well because if in the

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:12,190
future the client decided to to build

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:14,620
like an Alexa app or a mobile app or

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,570
something like that the we can literally

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,730
just grab the content we need it's not

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,260
weighed down by anything it hasn't got

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,640
any of the styling information that's

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,160
not necessary hasn't got any of the

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,570
metadata that's all in the book we can

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,519
just get down to the information we want

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:31,360
and it's completely reusable long

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:35,920
systems there were however a few

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,250
drawbacks to that so by creating more

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,540
abstraction which we thought was great

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,970
it can cause a little confusion for the

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,430
client so not only are we encouraging

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,110
them to think about what the content

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,370
they're writing but we're also trying to

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:55,720
teach them how to group that together it

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:58,000
also possibly isn't necessary so if we

00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,470
have a banner for example just a

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,399
full-width banner do we need a block and

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,029
a component for it

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,100
possibly not and then generally the main

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:08,980
issue was just how many mods were using

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,720
so for is just a simple component we've

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,880
already got a block and a component if

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,829
we've got like a list of logos we've got

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,199
the block the component and then a sub

00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:18,760
component for each logo with the image

00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:20,650
text link so we

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,960
have multiple sub components per

00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:28,270
component basically we're using a lot of

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:30,580
content models so the coal had to come

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,550
and unfortunately we had to get rid of

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,590
our lovely blocks layer and basically

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,450
end up with just a single block because

00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,630
we had so many content models we had to

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:45,340
scale back down to 48 and this is kind

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,940
of what we came up with of course a lot

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,190
of problems with that

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:51,160
so we had to make the blocks generic

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,410
which had a massive effect on the

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,600
codebase so before we had like a react

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,470
container for each block which is great

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,510
because we can just pull in the

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,830
components we want and things like that

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:04,870
but now we're suddenly having to use a

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,120
reread switch statement if statements to

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,490
just find out what components they're

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,970
using inside the block and then render

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:16,840
them out it also greatly affected the

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,460
client so in our initial model if if we

00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,990
had like a hero banner and we only

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,930
wanted them to be able to add that on

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,510
the home page we could specify that but

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,160
when a block can have any component

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,020
suddenly they can go into the cache

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,610
figure page and see that so we can't

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,580
limit it and we can't make it easier for

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,770
them it also meant that we had lots of

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,260
content log together so our initial idea

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,780
of just spreading out all these compress

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,680
content into different little components

00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,710
we're then suddenly had to have like

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,960
success messages error messages contact

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:50,110
details all rammed into these big

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,550
configuration files and although it

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,830
wasn't too big of a deal for us at the

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,800
moment with Gatsby in graph QL because

00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:59,320
we can just pick which bits we want in

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,700
the future we would if we using just

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,740
normally appear I would have to grab

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,670
that whole lot of data it's a lot

00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,440
heavier and not that great and basically

00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,660
it just I mean there was unscalable so

00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,630
we found that being flexible in your

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,880
content models basically has a direct

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:18,640
correlation with the scalability of your

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,290
applications and how you can read your

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,670
content in different applications so

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:26,380
moving on to the product section then

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:29,470
now the products were quite quite

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,529
complex in in the fact that you had a

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,870
product itself

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:35,189
and then quite traditionally really

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,009
within products you had a product

00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:40,199
variant and that was kind of rooted in

00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:42,540
the in the same product but actually it

00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,730
was it was specifically a variant of

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,370
this product and what you would expect

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,439
to see with that is in the URL you would

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,129
see that it was routed on under that

00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:55,319
slug under that path for that product

00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:58,740
and actually using this content model we

00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:59,850
had we found that quite quite tricky you

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,999
can see here we got this kind of root

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,730
page model which has what you'd expect

00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:09,449
for a web page which is title slug some

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,160
metadata for SEO some og tags etc and

00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:12,959
then the key thing here is we have this

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,699
template field and the template field

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,100
refers to a product in this case so

00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:18,329
that's defining that right this is this

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,949
is a product page and it's going to have

00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:22,470
a product on it then we have a load of

00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:25,050
information about product reaching out

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:28,199
to the technical specifications etc and

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,170
then the variants field actually reaches

00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,370
back out to a page which is back to the

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,759
start again so you kind of end up with

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:37,050
this like circular relationship and it's

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,269
important to note that in content for

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,069
you you have everything is linked it's

00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:44,040
just a flat like data structure you

00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:46,439
don't have like a parent-child situation

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,670
going on so even though that looks a

00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,490
little bit like a parent-child thing

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:54,000
it's actually not it's just like a link

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:55,620
and that this for content is really

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,740
really good and really nice and feels

00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,480
really kind of like but actually

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,959
for products we found that to be a

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,390
little bit tricky we did get there with

00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,939
our with our gasping graphic UL stuff

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,980
but a kind of a forewarning really that

00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,240
that was difficult to achieve in graphic

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,799
yo there was lots of kind of like having

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,899
to trace back to where a kind of a

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,630
product came from them and develop a

00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:20,579
slug because if you haven't used Gatsby

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,350
Gatsby needs a unique slug for every

00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,419
page that it creates because every page

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:29,070
is effectively dynamic which is then

00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:32,130
translated into static HTML so nice to

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:35,970
look at as a model but quite difficult

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,860
to work with so what we kind of what

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,870
we've done here maybe I've skipped over

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,800
this a little bit is we've effectively

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:46,050
modeled a product within it within a CMS

00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,450
and the question is is that the right

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,190
thing to do because there are systems

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,320
out there to model products you know you

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,780
might have a CMS that has ecommerce

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,390
support some of the monoliths CMS

00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,280
systems and they would have more complex

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,170
product systems now we didn't want to go

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,150
down that path because obviously we

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,070
don't want to use a monolith CMS for

00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,270
bigger clients that have tens of

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,090
thousands hundreds of thousands

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:11,790
approaches we might use a pin a product

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,830
information management system but our

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,680
products were less than 2,000 so we

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,480
decided to go down the CMS route and I

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,630
guess for us it's just like raising that

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,900
flag it's it's not the ideal place to

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:27,060
model products it can be done and from

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,950
an from the users perspective of

00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,930
changing from the editors perspective of

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,880
changing products it's actually quite

00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,580
slick but from the developers

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,740
perspective it's not that easy to work

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,610
with so the recommendation here would be

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,350
basically model within a pin and pull

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,570
that data into content for if you want

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,330
to and then just decorate that content

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,670
with whatever extra content you want and

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,530
just use content for fit for the content

00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,720
side of things and keep your products in

00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,150
a different system might be an obvious

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,880
thing but yeah it wasn't to us that's

00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:03,450
that's what we did so so we let the

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,910
lesson yet that the Russia isn't no way

00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,140
to push the time sorry so yeah no

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,940
parent-child relationships within

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,410
content for it's just worth thinking

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,580
about you know think about the content

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,410
that you're modeling is it actually

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,270
content or is it you know something very

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,220
specific it's if it's a product it's

00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,880
probably quite specific and it might not

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,430
be suited yet page slugs we talked about

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,510
and extra features like prices and taxes

00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,610
and stuff these would come out of the

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,230
box with it with a pin system and you

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,360
could definitely build it in content for

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,970
you could definitely make it work with

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,670
extensions or just front-end kind of

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:41,190
magic but it's probably not the right

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:43,410
place to be doing it effectively I think

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,530
that's it that's that's where we're at

00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,590
just 21 minutes

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,590
