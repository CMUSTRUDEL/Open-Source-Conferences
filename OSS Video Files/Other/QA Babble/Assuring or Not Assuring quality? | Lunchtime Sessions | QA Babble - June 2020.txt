Publication date: 2020-06-10
Playlist: QA Babble
Description: 
	QA Babble was organised by Woodrow Mercer and presented on YouTube by Pusher via Live-Stream.

"Assuring or Not Assuring quality?"

Continuous testing, continuous delivery, DevOps â€“ these are all terms very popular in the last couple of years, and they all involve a shift in the way we deliver products, testing included! So who is responsible for the quality assurance nowadays?
In this talk I'll go through some steps we took and processes we implemented to create a higher collaborative space where everyone takes ownership of changes all the way through rather than handing them over between us.
Of course, we'll also focus on the questions everyone is thinking about: "Do you still have testers? And what do they do now?"

Speaker bio:

Head of Quality Engineering at Wealth Wizards by role, evangelist of continuous delivery and automation by heart. Working as an Automation in Test Engineer in different environments for the past 9 years, my main focus is to shift testing activities as left as possible, to work closely with the stakeholders to create smarter automated checks, and to understand the system architecture so that the automation is created in the right place.
