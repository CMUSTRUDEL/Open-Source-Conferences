Baptism of Fire - Becoming a Modern Test Leader with Simon Prior

Having been in Software engineering for 11 years and QA for 7 years, in June 2017, I became a QA Manager. Without any training, I went from Technical Lead to QA Manager almost overnight. I’ll admit, I felt like an imposter, if it hadn’t been for the support from my manager in particular, I’m not sure how I would have proceeded. It was always a change I wanted to make but was I prepared for what this role was really all about?
From day 1 and from no fault of the company, I needed to take on managing the local QA team and build a brand new team in Cork, Ireland too. My eyes were open to the fact there were big differences between the lead role and the management role and also of the differences between companies. This talk will go through what I had to overcome since becoming a manager and look at the main lessons I have learned.
Since becoming a manager, some of the hurdles to overcome were the following:
- Hiring and coaching a whole new team in a remote location
- Resignations
- Taking a team member through a disciplinary process
- In-team disputes
- Difference in views of Quality between myself and management
- Battling a view of testing being an activity completed at the end of a project
- Reaching Burnout and how I overcome it

Below are some of the lessons I learned:
- Encouraging and advocating technical decisions from your team rather than making them myself
- Always putting your people first, coaching and supporting them
- Dealing with people’s reaction to you after a title change and having a consistent approach with all team members
- Being Willing to stand up and be the voice for the team
- Not taking resignations personally

I will talk through this to show how we as test managers can stay relevant in the current world and help drive our teams forward.

next in line of our Q about online

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,260
sessions really good to see such a great

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,350
turnout

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,860
doing his presentation today on baptism

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,100
by fire between a modern test that will

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,350
go till circa sort of twenty five to

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,270
twenty to one at which point we will do

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,110
it Renee we're going one who needs to

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,250
the moment just so there's no

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,760
interruptions through the stream room

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,530
will sort of disable that for the Q&A

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,090
for that we're going to use the raise

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,360
hand function if you want us a question

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,940
so just get your name put raised up I

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,250
see that and then also you can direct

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,170
your questions Simon I'm also we've got

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,250
the live chat on the go as well so if

00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,780
you want to chat in the back row at

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,300
Scone I have a description about things

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,010
taught or suggest links or books or

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,710
websites or training courses pretty

00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,270
easily to do stay on top of that also on

00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,070
that flight takes weeks and that'd be

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,920
awesome

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:05,380
thanks Anthony cheers everyone and thank

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,530
you for coming along and I apologize for

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,020
my interesting bizarre surroundings I'm

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,580
stuck in the overflow toy room it's the

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,460
only place I could find a desk in our

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:19,930
house so just this this presentation and

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,940
it's it's going to go through my journey

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,919
from when I went in first went into

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,570
management and how I've progressed

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,040
through that and then I'll talk a bit

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:31,510
more about my ideas around modern

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,490
testing leadership just there we go so

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,650
just a bit about me to start with that's

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:39,250
me that's my family my two little boys

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:41,770
and my wife I'm currently a Test Manager

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,580
easy yet heading up the what we call the

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,440
core QA team our focus is becoming kind

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,620
of a standards and center of excellence

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,300
for the whole of easyJet from a testing

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,040
perspective

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,400
building out the automation processes

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,770
identifying the right tools suggesting

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,960
better ways of testing coaching across

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,150
the organization to ensure testing is is

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,200
in the right places obviously it's

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,860
taking a bit of a standstill at the

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,539
moment my team's been furloughed so I'm

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,640
I'm sort of working with my offshore

00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,900
team to carry on keeping the lights on

00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,840
at the moment

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,430
I'm also a step ambassador in my

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,810
previous roles I've been going out to

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,210
schools and doing careers talks on

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,720
testing I've done Internet safety talks

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,550
as when I was at McAfee and it really

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,430
developed a passion for me to try and

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,650
give something back to the industry and

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,600
try and get more people into testing

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,280
I'm also co-host of the Ministry of

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,230
testing Buckinghamshire branch we've

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,180
actually gotten online meet up tonight I

00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,680
can send the link out afterwards for

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,200
anyone that's interesting or just look

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,390
on my LinkedIn page or mot Bucks on

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,870
Twitter and we've got Parveen Khan

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,370
talking about her journey into DevOps

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,840
I'm also a mental health first aider I

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,690
will talk written briefly about that

00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,840
later in the talk I've given this talk

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:00,190
at UK star last year I've enhanced it

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,100
since then but that was the first time I

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,620
presented this talk and I've done a few

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,570
other conference talks as well and

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,390
finally I have to plug this we launched

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,820
our podcast two weeks ago now testing

00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,770
peers we've done two episodes so if you

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,890
want to find out more listen to that

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,930
testing peers calm or search for testing

00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,400
peers on Spotify Apple podcasts or

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,110
whichever you listen to your podcasts on

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,520
and give us your feedback we'd love to

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,020
hear what you think so onto the talk so

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,380
before I came a manager so I graduated

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,900
in 2007 with a computer science degree

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,580
from Hull University and I really didn't

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,840
want to go into development and but

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,450
there really wasn't many options out

00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,180
there at the time so I felt felt that

00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,890
was the path to start with so I ended up

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,850
doing a graduate scheme at McAfee and

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,020
taking a position as a C++ developer I

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,910
worked in development for four to five

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:56,020
years but general in that way found that

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,520
there was a lot of smart people in my

00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,340
team in the development team that were

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,870
10 15 years more my senior so getting

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,290
the meaty development work was never

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,760
really an option I I got the small bug

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,580
fixes all the things that they felt they

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,780
could trust me to do and I started

00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,210
finding that testing was more

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,000
interesting and started taking up

00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,670
testing tasks in the sprints and

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,360
eventually got my joy it made my wish to

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:24,490
move over to QA in 2010 from there I

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,310
worked for several different teams and

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,470
eventually became a QA lead and then

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,870
this is where it became unto this so I

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,209
went I went from an icy to a tech lead I

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,470
was a tech lead for three or four three

00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:40,540
or four years across different teams

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:44,050
both with offshore offshore to onshore

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,999
teams in Aylesbury in the UK I became

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,199
the technical go-to person on projects

00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:49,569
they would cut people would come to me

00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:52,420
first before going to the the dev leads

00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:54,279
I tended to have the overall knowledge

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,889
because I was helping tester the

00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,029
end-to-end process so people felt they

00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,639
could they could come to me to ask

00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,379
questions I was obviously as a lead I

00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,939
was coordinating the testing efforts I

00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:05,829
was helping write the test plans I was

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:07,499
leading the estimate activities trying

00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:09,639
to get the team more collaborative

00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:12,040
trying to bring in ideas around

00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,529
testability and other things like that

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,529
to try and improve our testing process

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:20,470
and I was involved in writing tests

00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:23,139
running tests reporting everything that

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,660
s lead would be expected to do along

00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:27,999
with mentoring coaching building up the

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,709
team I was at they even a few years ago

00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:31,389
I was still very passionate at bringing

00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:33,790
new ideas into the team helping him

00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:37,449
helping them improve their skill sets

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,939
and going forward and for a long time I

00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:42,250
had a manager in the US so I was the

00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:46,120
local local lead for the team in in

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,620
Aylesbury in the UK and literally I got

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,870
a call one day I'd already expressed

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,790
that I thought I was I was a I was more

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,529
of a people person than a hands-on

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,610
technical person long-term so I wanted

00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:58,209
to go into management I've made that

00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,250
quite clear and I got a phone call on a

00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:02,439
Friday saying you're gonna become a

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,379
manager and we need to take on the team

00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:07,449
from Monday and literally it went from

00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,970
being a lead actively involved in the

00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,589
testing on the Friday to managing not

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,449
might not only the team I had currently

00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,490
working with me but another team on a

00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:17,319
different project that needed building

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,269
from scratch in Cork in Ireland on a

00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:21,250
completely different project I had no

00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:23,110
knowledge of so I literally went from

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,420
having a technical hands-on role where I

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,329
was come my pure focus was on the

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,269
testing activities of that one project

00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:32,949
to happen to be non-technical having to

00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:37,860
oversee two different teams on two

00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:39,420
different projects so as I said I

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,430
two teams in different countries one in

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,110
the UK one in Aylesbury UK one in Cork

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,290
in Ireland working on completely

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:50,040
different projects not any any overlap

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:52,380
between the two teams at all one was

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,000
around the Anti Malware daily releases

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,380
that were going out to customers the

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,079
other team was about our web reputation

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,300
and URL reputation stats and data that

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,130
we were plugging into a database so that

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,810
people could browse websites and know

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,390
whether they were safe or not so

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,250
completely different areas somehow

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,010
because of a restructure they've been

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,300
put under the same organisation and they

00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,839
needed me to oversee the magnitude the

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,839
testing of both areas the team I had in

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,120
air ellsbury were relatively mature a

00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,260
lot of very senior people lot of very

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,100
people that were set in their ways

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,360
didn't like changing the way of working

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,180
compared to a team in Cork in Ireland

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,240
that I had to build from scratch I had

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:37,680
to identify the right talent to bring in

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,570
and nurture and grow that team so I was

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,420
from day one pulled in very different

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:46,110
directions over how to how to move

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,760
forward so they needed different types

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,010
of support as I say the team in

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,680
Aylesbury they needed guidance they

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:56,670
needed help improve in the process

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,860
whereas the teaming cork had I as I said

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,990
I interviewed 50 or 60 different

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,790
candidates there was four junior

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,110
positions or sorry three junior

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,470
positions and one slightly more senior

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,640
position that I had to add to Phil I did

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,100
lots of telephone interviews lots of

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,839
video calls went out to Cork to actually

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,660
do the the face-to-face interviews with

00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,430
people as well so I had a lot lot lot to

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,350
do to build that team up as well as

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,570
keeping the old team going on top of

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,740
that I had to learn a brand new domain

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,350
an area that I had not worked in before

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,250
and and once the new team was on board I

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,420
had to teach them everything about

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:32,540
testing so I - as I say changed the

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,769
mindset of the XPS and proved myself

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,610
with them that I could be a manager

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:41,279
there was a lot of I'd obviously worked

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,990
as a peer with that team and you know

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,510
working side by side with them and

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,510
suddenly I was expected the manager

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,010
so I had to find new ways to try and to

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,570
start with dividing my time evenly

00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,700
between the two teams there was two

00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,960
teams of five effectively or sorry a

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,760
team of four in court to start with a

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,410
team of five in Aylesbury I tried to

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,240
divide up the one two ones over the

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,550
space of two weeks so I ever want to get

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,380
their their time allocated with me I try

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,170
and make sure that I was only on half

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,850
each day I try and focus on it on both

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,130
teams so I had half a day with each team

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,090
so I could keep keep on top of

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,210
everything that was going on a

00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:22,220
day-to-day basis I started delicate

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,570
delegating all the actual active testing

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,210
work that was hanging over from when I

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,950
was a lead that I had on to the other

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,540
team so I could focus on building the

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,370
teams and getting the one two ones in

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,170
place and and learning that learning the

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:37,670
skill set I needed to become a good

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:39,890
manager I was now also seen as the

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,420
quality decision maker in two completely

00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,000
different areas to come of the

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,140
organization so I had to be able to

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
understand and get enough information

00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,310
about the different areas to be able to

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,130
be that decision maker in the in the

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:55,520
senior leadership meetings around those

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,750
areas as well as that I had the two year

00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,990
old and a six month old at home at this

00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,840
time

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,310
so my responsibilities were changing it

00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,700
based in the workplace and at home as

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,830
well I had to get used to the fact that

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:10,940
I was no longer going to be able to do

00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:12,560
hand hands-on active testing but this

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,330
kind of goes in line with my thought

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,680
process around testing anyway testing is

00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,080
more than just the execution of the

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,030
tests testing is a mindset that needs to

00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,950
be started as soon as a project is

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,420
conceptualized you need to get people

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,280
into that way of thinking and that was

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,380
something that I started to embed in my

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,270
teams that you know you might not be

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,460
executing tests but you're still testing

00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,680
so I had to make sure I was delegating

00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,210
more of might that work I was getting

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,070
more involved in the high-level planning

00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,930
and leading the process improvements

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:43,970
trying to get new tools in place looking

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:45,680
RCI pipeline and spending majority of my

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,620
time doing coaching and supporting the

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,860
teams to get them up to speed and

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,390
encourage everyone to ask more questions

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,740
especially the new team in Cork who were

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,930
learning a new domain themselves

00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,930
learning testing form for three of them

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:02,060
at least so it was about giving them the

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,720
toolset to be able to get the knowledge

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,319
they need to be able to

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,399
their job as I say showing Mort so in

00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,269
both teams there's more to it than

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,180
execution only so with the team in

00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:18,120
Elle's brief and that I took on I had to

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,250
manage a team where at least one of them

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,339
had wanted the management position as

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,889
well so I had resentment from day one

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:30,360
from that person that I had to try and

00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:33,750
overcome and show them how we can work

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,310
together I had two that treated me

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,689
suddenly treated me very formally now

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,360
that I was a manager they'd stand up

00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:41,970
when I walked to their desk which threw

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,339
me because the week before I'd worked

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,170
side by side with them we'd have a laugh

00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,839
we'd would get through the work together

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,120
there was a real sort of United Front

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,310
attitude but suddenly I was treated more

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,750
standoffish and I had to get used to

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,399
that and try and build that bridge up

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,170
again and showed them in my new role

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,060
that I was still the same person and

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,089
capable of doing the role I needed to do

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,319
I did struggle to shift from colleague

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,030
to manager there was a couple of

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,010
instances where I'd go and try and sit

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,890
with the team at lunchtime and have have

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:13,110
lunch and they'd look at me as if I was

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,370
I had three heads why was I sitting with

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,289
them why was I not going to sitting with

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:19,530
my new manager friends and I hadn't

00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:21,089
quite got that I hadn't quite got that

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,439
that feeling that it was at that

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,329
different I thought I was still part of

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,130
the team I had to start trying to

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:29,120
distance myself from the team from us in

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,770
a social perspective to some level and

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,080
try and take on more ownership of of

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,760
being that that head of the team

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,880
effectively and having the

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,650
responsibility that came with within the

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,169
first year that team I had two

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,000
resignations which you know was

00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:46,260
upsetting in some ways because I started

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,820
to doubt myself maybe I was doing

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,580
something wrong and maybe I could have

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,860
handled handled it differently maybe I

00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,260
didn't show them enough compassion from

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,850
when I first took over the role I tried

00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,370
to give them what they needed to help

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,380
them move forward and and and carry on

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:04,679
in their roles as they were but they

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,419
felt that they couldn't whether it was

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,070
me or whether it was just a matter of

00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,350
circumstance they felt they needed to

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,140
move on this gave me the opportunity to

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,950
hire myself which I have to admit was

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,110
probably one of the most enjoyable

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,159
processes in all of this was hiring the

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,659
team that I felt was right

00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:24,629
so I got to build the team I wanted with

00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:26,429
the new team I had to start with I had

00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:27,690
to build rapport with the dev manager

00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,119
that was where else gonna be working

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,559
alongside and from an offshore

00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,720
perspective that was quite difficult I

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,970
had to you know I got onto daily calls

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,289
with him video calls where possible when

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,809
I was over in Ireland I would go and

00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:41,399
spend time with him and and learn the

00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:45,720
domains

00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:48,090
I interviewed probably a lot more that I

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,679
probably physically video called or

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,149
face-to-face interviewed about 20 I

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,009
definitely phone interviewed a lot more

00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:54,509
than that to fill the four positions I

00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:56,940
had one went through I was three very

00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:58,979
junior like University and entrance

00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,639
level positions and one slightly more

00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:06,389
senior I hired three passionate

00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:08,429
candidates for the junior roles only

00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:10,080
well two of them had never touched

00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:11,929
testing before and I had to convince

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,099
them that testing was an option and I

00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:15,929
sold it to them on that on my passion

00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:18,499
for testing and how I could make them

00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:20,759
into I make them into successful testers

00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:22,889
the third one had done a year of testing

00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,659
and she she came in and she hit the

00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:26,340
ground running and then I hired a

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:28,229
slightly more senior one as well who who

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,450
again had the knowledge before I'd

00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:32,460
worked at the company before and their

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,019
different team and was able to move over

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,899
to Ireland to take on that position I

00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:38,489
was traveling to Ireland every month I'd

00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:40,169
have daily video calls with the team as

00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:44,340
well to make sure they were up to speed

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:45,840
and anything to help them the most fun

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,909
thing with this was I got to shape that

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,099
team the knowledge any knowledge of QA

00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:52,139
they had came from what I was able to

00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:53,669
teach them so I knew how important it

00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:56,070
was to get it right and get it right

00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:58,460
from the start and not get them into a

00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,989
mindset where testing was this secondary

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,669
secondary activity that's lesser than

00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:04,320
the development I had to make sure they

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,849
believed in testing they were passionate

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,649
about what they were doing and they were

00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:11,489
doing the right thing to deliver high

00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:13,109
quality software and I think I did a

00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:16,200
successful job of building that building

00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:17,490
the strong foundations there

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,070
one other thing we managed in the two

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,960
teams that I did struggle with was the

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,850
meeting schedule I would be in meetings

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,100
from half eight to half five every day

00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,690
without fail I'd also have the

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,309
occasional early morning meeting to

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,990
discuss things with the team in India

00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,179
I'd have late-night meetings being a

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,760
global company headquarters in the US

00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,320
they'd be meeting 7 8 9 10 o'clock at

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,419
night sometimes as well so my days were

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,860
literally full of meetings whether it be

00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:42,830
project meetings one-to-one team

00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,970
discussions men to industry sessions

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,679
there was also a lot of meetings that

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,019
I'd be invited to just because I was a

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,519
manager they'd be a site managers

00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:51,899
meeting where every person with a

00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,669
manager's title in the meat in their

00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:55,860
manager in their title would get invited

00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,559
to a site eating to discuss facilities

00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,149
or site issues there'd be other things

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,159
that would just fill up the calendar the

00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:04,019
one thing I tried to make sure was that

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,289
the one two ones were not the meetings

00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:09,240
that got pushed out I tried to make sure

00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:13,230
that everyone had their allocated one to

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,630
one time and would only cancel it if if

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,450
there was a genuine way I could not move

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,649
it or not move the other meeting or find

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:23,100
another way to have that discussion with

00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:25,110
them so this all meant that when I

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:29,100
wasn't in meetings I'd have to do my

00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:31,080
work in evenings so very soon three four

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,850
months into management I realized that I

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,289
needed to find a way to change my

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,690
meeting schedule because I was getting

00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:40,710
no time during the day to do any work to

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,470
do any documents to do any performance

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,669
reviews anything that I need to do

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,750
become as part of my workload I was

00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,279
having to leave till the evenings

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,830
because I was in meetings all day long

00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,480
and that was obviously difficult because

00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,100
having a young young family at home

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,690
especially with a baby that wasn't into

00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,139
a regular sleep routine at that point I

00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,580
was I was sort of taking childcare in

00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:00,299
the evening sometimes so my wife could

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,880
get some sleep

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:04,679
so I had had to juggle having a baby and

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,450
also trying to be on work doing work as

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:11,279
well which made it difficult but

00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:14,549
something that really did ignite the

00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,620
passion was getting getting the the

00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:19,279
getting the chance to do coaching and

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,690
mentoring and building up the teams so

00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,460
learning the skills to do successful

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,110
coaching and mentoring was was something

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,409
I really enjoyed doing I went on a very

00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,700
good leadership course for the two to

00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:32,399
three days

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,220
by an organization called aspire in

00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:37,710
London and that gave me the passion to

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,870
really want to to take on the coaching

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,580
mentoring and and and help build the

00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,799
teams up

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,149
I've always been since learning about it

00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,519
I've been very passionate about building

00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:48,990
a culture of quality and this is

00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,100
something that I definitely tried to

00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,269
push forward by inspiring the team

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,889
showing them all the new techniques or

00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,940
the new ways of working that would help

00:22:55,889 --> 00:23:01,019
improve quality earlier on shifting left

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,850
raising the awareness of testing across

00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,010
the organization building an internal

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,960
community building an external community

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,639
trying to get everything in place so

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,350
that testing had its place at the table

00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:13,049
and everyone felt they were part of

00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:16,070
something big and and that definitely

00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:18,480
made a difference to the way the team

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,000
was perceived within within the

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,039
organization because testing was given

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,440
that place where it was treated as an

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,970
equal to the development to the product

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,470
management everything else it was seen

00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:32,970
as part of the puzzle rather than being

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:34,440
this less apart I did definitely found

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,779
that transition to supporting people

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,389
more enjoyable than I thought I would I

00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:40,710
I loved being technical I loved finding

00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:43,649
those defects that no one else was

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:46,169
prepared to look down deep to find but

00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:47,970
actually I also found that helping other

00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:49,529
people learn those skills to dive deep

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,080
and find issues was actually just as

00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:53,610
enjoyable and I do remember a couple of

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,470
times especially with the team in

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,389
Ireland where I'd give them a session on

00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,130
how to identify the test scenarios and

00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:02,070
how to look for defects in particular

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,389
instances of functionality and see their

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,710
our eyes light up when they realized

00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:06,510
they might be on to something and they

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,940
found a defect because of something I

00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,169
taught them and and that is definitely

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,860
much more rewarding than finding the

00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:12,860
defects yourself

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:19,220
there was a tough element to it as well

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,539
that I did struggle with especially with

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,019
the ones that I'd worked side by side

00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:27,620
with beforehand was having the tough

00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:31,009
that having to talk difficult

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:33,409
conversations stressful conversations

00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:34,820
definitely took a toll you know the

00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,289
nights before you had to do you wouldn't

00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,360
be out of sleep and there's one

00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:39,559
particular where I was starting to get a

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,470
couple of bits of feedback from the dev

00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:45,860
team that one of the one of the members

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,690
of their team was distracting in

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:52,100
meetings was was not really paying

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:53,419
attention was not not working in the way

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,039
that we wanted them to work they were

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:56,629
they were becoming quite difficult to

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,690
work with so I had to get out to Island

00:24:56,629 --> 00:25:02,299
literally the next day to go and talk to

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,529
them and that day in itself I was

00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:05,539
scheduled to be on the nine o'clock

00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:09,409
flight out of out of heath road to Cork

00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:10,909
that got delayed till two o'clock so by

00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:12,950
the time I got to Cork it was half past

00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,389
four quarter to 5:00 I managed to

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,279
persuade this person to stay at the

00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:17,720
office go and talk to them for an hour

00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,919
and then get back on the plane took a

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,610
flight home and I got home at 10 o'clock

00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,490
in evening

00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:24,649
so for an hour's meeting where I took

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:27,019
evidence I wrote down everything that

00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:29,090
I'd heard I I tried to put it into a

00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:30,889
constructive way of talking I didn't go

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,509
over to tell him how terrible he was I

00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:34,009
went over to tell him okay these are the

00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:36,440
areas that I think we need to improve on

00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:37,460
let's try and put a plan in place to get

00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,460
you to where you need to be to be

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,110
successful and yes it was difficult but

00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,759
it was also rewarding because he

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,490
understood where we were coming from and

00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,629
we've got something in place to make him

00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,220
successful when he's still in that

00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:52,100
position now as a successful member of

00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,779
the testing team I also had some issues

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,669
with infighting within the local team

00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:58,190
there was a couple of members of the

00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:59,389
team that didn't get on and I didn't

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,279
know the history that I didn't get on

00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:06,019
before they were brought into the team

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:08,419
together and that caused the infighting

00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:10,070
within the team which was not fairly

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:11,360
embarrassing but it wasn't good for us

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,460
to be seen as the team that had

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,409
arguments going on across the office so

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,999
I had to pull them into a room talk to

00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:19,759
them try and get them to understand what

00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:23,210
the problems were being caused and

00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,190
solved that as well I was also having to

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,929
constantly push away additional requests

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,950
for work because I wanted to ensure my

00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:29,330
team

00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,920
to do the job they needed to do

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,830
successfully and not take on extra work

00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:36,320
if we didn't have the resources to do it

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:38,450
I did that learn very quickly that

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,740
nipping things in the bug was the most

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,880
important thing to do in those scenarios

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:46,460
before it escalated out of control now

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,400
because of my my tendency to always want

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,650
to have multiple plates spinning I got

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,320
to a point where I had too many things

00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,760
going on at once my work emails had

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,930
become my social media so I would

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,890
literally when I woke up in the middle

00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,390
of the night rather than checking

00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,630
Facebook or Twitter I'd be checking my

00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:04,520
work emails and responding to emails and

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,750
you know no one ever email me back

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,010
saying why are you responding at two

00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,570
o'clock in the morning they almost

00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,580
expect because I started doing it they

00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,100
expected me to continue doing it

00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:15,620
I got complaints that I wasn't spending

00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,540
enough time on my local team so I was

00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,020
you know flying out to Cork once a month

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:23,030
it was taking time to build that team up

00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,040
and I wasn't able to quite get the

00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,720
balance right I was running a local

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,510
testing meself the Ministry of testing

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,130
Buckinghamshire branch was been run for

00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,110
the last five or six years in Aylesbury

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,460
I was running that on a monthly basis

00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,590
and that was taking up time organizing

00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,390
sponsors and speakers and especially

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,420
evening time doing that that part of the

00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,310
work I was also the lead volunteer on

00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,900
our online internet safety project at

00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,460
McAfee so I was going out to schools

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,710
regularly getting other volunteers from

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,570
within McAfee to go with me and present

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,160
to school kids about the dangers of the

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,030
internet so that was taking up time and

00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,490
although it was throwing McAfee

00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:59,120
encouraged it was taking me away from my

00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:01,070
day-to-day work as well I I was obsessed

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,690
and I still am obsessed with learning

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,670
new things about testing and listening

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,190
to podcast I mean my list of podcast in

00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:09,020
my my playlist I need to get through is

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,730
probably 20 or 30 long at the moment I'm

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,320
trying to get through them but obviously

00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,240
more podcasts come out the gates at the

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,470
bottom and it continues and I I'll never

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,940
get on top of it but that's just one of

00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,300
my obsessions with learning and and

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,710
trying to find out new things and and

00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,530
improving my knowledge effectively and

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,090
at home I was still a dad and a husband

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:31,160
too

00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:34,010
it came to a point in March 2018 where I

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,010
collapsed at home at the breakfast table

00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:38,240
in front of the kids

00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,530
head-butted the table on the way down so

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,610
there was blood everywhere and my wife

00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,130
called 9:9 had to remove my

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:47,280
from the back of my throat I was taken

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,780
into a knee I spent the day in a knee

00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,040
they couldn't find anything particularly

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,370
wrong and it all came down to it being

00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,320
stress-related so all that because I was

00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,380
doing too much I was as I said I was

00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,840
working all hours I was I was constantly

00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,580
feeling the pressure of being everything

00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,510
for everyone whether it be work-related

00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:09,320
you know the two teams at home trying to

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,340
be the best husband and dad I could be

00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,510
there was phrases being thrown around

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,540
like even when you're here you're never

00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:17,340
present you know so I was constantly not

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,440
in the room even though I was in I was

00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,840
physically in the room and as I say I

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,919
collapsed and and spent the day in

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,530
hospital after that that gave me the

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,210
awakening I needed and that encouraged

00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:33,630
me to correct the balance so I

00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:36,510
immediately took two weeks off just to

00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:38,790
reset the balance I removed my work

00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,200
emails from my personal mobile and only

00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,940
had my work mobile and left that out of

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,740
the room put it in a box by the door

00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,830
honi picked up when I needed to pick it

00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:49,770
up I found the budget to hire a lead for

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:52,760
the offshore team I hired an amazing

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:54,870
lead probably the best horror ever made

00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,620
really took on the team from a

00:29:54,870 --> 00:30:00,059
day-to-day basis gave me the chance to

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,130
take on a more strategic role and

00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:04,410
enabled them to do the day-to-day work I

00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,910
reduced my external commitments I

00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,520
stopped the meet up for a couple of for

00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:12,030
a year or so I stepped back from the

00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,679
volunteering program and tried to focus

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:16,710
on family time when I wasn't in the

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,910
office and I invested him myself and

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:23,520
devised my purse values that I would

00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:25,080
then live my working life by so these

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,690
were my testing values that I came up

00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,549
with these this was done for me by the

00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,440
graphic was done for me by Gabby Trotter

00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:33,059
from searchability she put this together

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,030
for me but just to run through the UM

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:37,830
these for you it was a testing is a

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,360
mindset again it comes back to it's not

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:42,270
just the execution of the tests it's

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,070
it's the way the thought process and and

00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,320
how we think about things how we

00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,630
question things

00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,640
ensuring it isn't just a case of the

00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,750
testing team runs the test window at the

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,850
end of a project and that's the only

00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,340
involvement they have making sure that

00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:58,820
testings involved at start

00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:00,890
project the bugbear of a hundred percent

00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,540
of testing being automated should never

00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,250
be a consideration yes we should have

00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,540
automation in place and we should

00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,860
complement that with our manual

00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,380
exploratory process as well

00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,580
we should never aim for 100 cent

00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,190
automation because there's always going

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,600
to be scenarios that can't be covered

00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,650
and just because the automation or cast

00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,140
doesn't necessarily mean there's no

00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,880
defects in your code and the other big

00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,920
thing for me was the test team or

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,510
testing as a concept was valued as

00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,390
highly as any other disciplines within

00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:28,820
the organization so that was my testing

00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,440
side and that that played into any of my

00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,850
future roles that I then took I made

00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,590
sure I looked at these values and

00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,900
aligned them was why I was going into it

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:38,390
and then I had my personal leadership

00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:41,270
values as well this is the way I felt I

00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:44,330
should lead my teams so I protect them

00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:48,740
from any external external distractions

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:52,130
whether it be you know bad news or bad

00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:54,590
things coming down from above or or

00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,720
sideways Pete people from the from other

00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:58,850
sides trying to get in on my team and

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,500
use them for the project work I'd make

00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,180
sure I could protect them I would

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,860
nurture them by giving them the skillset

00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,420
they need and you know putting the

00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,910
metaphorical arm around them if they

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:10,220
needed it so to encourage them I would

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:13,400
empower them by giving them a voice and

00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:16,160
and allowing them to be the ones that

00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,110
stepped forward and had it had an answer

00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,670
or stated something in meetings because

00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,370
they believe that we shouldn't go live

00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,960
because of x y&z and I backed them so

00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,510
they felt that they could go step

00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,980
forward and also I evangelize for them I

00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,260
shout from the rooftops when success is

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,120
I talk about how great my team's teams

00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,740
are I give them the confidence that

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,960
somebody cares about them and someone

00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,030
has their back and that really helped

00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,580
build this this culture within my group

00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:43,850
that we bonded together we had a team

00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:46,970
that worked closely together so I used

00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:48,800
my values eventually I left McAfee and I

00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:52,720
moved roles to try and find a better fit

00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:55,250
and I use my values to align to that I

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,410
spent a year in a very waterfall

00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,300
environment where testing was only seen

00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,340
as an end activity but in that year I

00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,800
transformed as best I could

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:07,910
I transformed the team to take on more

00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,230
shift left practices I I was able to

00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,970
raise the awareness of core

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,580
see within the organization I spoke at

00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:16,730
All Hands meetings I used the test fare

00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,350
cards deck 2 which I have here just in

00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,820
case anyone hasn't seen test fear

00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:24,740
20-pound on the ministry a testing site

00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:26,149
test fit card deck to talk about testing

00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,190
with other teams to get them aware of

00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:29,450
what we do and really get a feeling of

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,490
wow testers know more than just

00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,669
executing tests they can do so much more

00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:36,740
I also shifted got us to shift left and

00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:38,269
have a testability process in place on

00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,760
the requirements gathering at the start

00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:43,299
yes the team was never going to be agile

00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,010
because of the way they were set up the

00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:49,429
regulations around the work they did and

00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:51,380
the third-party development companies

00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:53,389
they used and testing was only done as

00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,220
an end activity after that arrived but I

00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:57,580
was able to change the process and the

00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,590
thought process within the business of

00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:02,149
we're testing fit and how we could be

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,740
used and we used to start to get into

00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:05,059
conversations where we'd be involved at

00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,740
the start and help define requirements

00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:09,649
rather than only be in there to review

00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,419
them or be involved in scenarios where

00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:12,950
we'd never been involved before such as

00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:14,899
infrastructure and everything else being

00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:17,810
set up correctly so I was able to help

00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:20,030
transform that I rewrote the test

00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,440
strategy I rewrote the test policy I put

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,960
different metrics and measures in place

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,720
to help the team move forward and I

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,730
became the without not the face of QA

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,329
but I became the go-to guy for testing

00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:36,169
people would come and talk to me rather

00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:37,819
than my boss about testing and that that

00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:41,060
helps the team all feel like they were

00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:42,700
being included I was also able to mentor

00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:47,450
and coach the team to move them forward

00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:49,579
but after a year I felt like I'd I done

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:52,280
what I could do and I didn't feel like I

00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:55,159
was necessarily I necessarily fit in the

00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,690
organization I felt like I I needed to

00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,119
move somewhere where I felt more part of

00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:02,319
a team and that that led me to move to

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,319
easyJet which is where I am now

00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:11,599
so I'm conscious of time so what have I

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,010
learned from all this first thing I

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,200
learned was that moving to management is

00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,819
not a promotion it's a change of career

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,160
path you're effectively starting at an

00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:21,079
entry-level management career part at

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,760
that point and I think this is where

00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,060
companies companies sometimes get it

00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,190
wrong

00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,420
because there isn't a career path

00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:29,360
technical skills path or career path for

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:31,100
technical side there is for you know the

00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,860
did that the natural natural progression

00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:36,380
is you go from a test engineer or a

00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,750
tester to a senior tester to a test lead

00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,550
and then to a test manager and that

00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,440
doesn't always work because you'd have

00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,240
to take on the people side of things

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,160
rather than just the technical side so

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,260
companies need to move to having two

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,940
pathways having a technical pathway

00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,620
maybe the Technical Architect or a

00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,290
principal tester or something else that

00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:56,000
gives them an option to move up a same

00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:58,010
seniority level but just not with the

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,210
people responsibilities and for people

00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,950
that want to move into people management

00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,910
then there's a managerial path there as

00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:06,320
well one thing I I learned as I

00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,550
mentioned early on is be aware of the

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,100
expectations you are setting for

00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,510
yourself no boss is ever gonna tell you

00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,360
off for working too hard and by that I

00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:16,040
mean you'll very rarely get a boss that

00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:19,250
will say to you at 10 11 o'clock at

00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,660
night why are you still online there may

00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,640
be some out there and I'd like to think

00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:26,120
that I would I would step in if I saw my

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,120
team online at that time and and tell

00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,890
them not to but if you continue to set

00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,360
to do that work at that time people will

00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,100
expect you to be working in that time

00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,840
and suddenly you'll you'll set yourself

00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,900
when unrealistic goals to achieve

00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,920
because you people will expect you to

00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,390
they'll be working 10 o'clock at night

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,820
and finishing something for them on a

00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:45,890
regular basis the occasional late-night

00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,050
working because there's a deadline to

00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:51,230
come to me is fine but don't let it

00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:54,980
become your norm don't take things

00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:57,440
personally so things often are in a

00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,690
place where things do go wrong you know

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,120
somebody somebody may decide to leave

00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:05,330
somebody may decide to move teams etc

00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:07,070
etc don't it doesn't necessarily mean it

00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,930
was your fault but yes it's a good time

00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:10,100
to self reflect and look at how things

00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,960
could be could have been done

00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,000
differently and if you could have done

00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,650
something to change it then think about

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,630
that have the conversation with someone

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,450
and show them that you're you're

00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:22,430
thinking about it and you're not you're

00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:25,010
not glad they're moving on or etc etc

00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:27,740
just show a bit of compassion for them

00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,690
make time for your people so as I said I

00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,250
tried and made sure my want to want with

00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,740
the concrete meetings that always

00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,660
happens because I felt that spending

00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:38,570
time with your team will help the work

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,280
just progress if you if you make time

00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,720
for them then generally the work falls

00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,160
into place because they have the

00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,450
confidence that you have their back they

00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,590
can do the work they can come and talk

00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,880
to you if you need to talk that they

00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:50,750
need to talk to you about anything and

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,360
and things generally move forward so

00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,920
then taking this on let's I wanted to

00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,660
sort of talk a bit more about what I

00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,100
believe a modern test manager now looks

00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:03,230
like because let's be honest the testing

00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,590
the testing world the tech world is

00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:08,510
changing there is no longer a need for a

00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:11,120
test manager that is handing out tasks

00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:12,440
to his testing so he knows the projects

00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,150
coming up and he's gonna write you're

00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,980
gonna do that bit of human adapt it work

00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:19,820
that task for you this to us for you I

00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,950
want you to test this it is there isn't

00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,950
also no longer the need for a single

00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:27,440
testing decision maker the quality the

00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,530
quality culture is definitely about

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,430
everyone being having a voice of quality

00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,590
everyone having a voice of whether

00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,750
whether we're ready to go live so this

00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:37,910
this single need of old testings

00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,880
complete testing signed off is no longer

00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:43,040
as relevant as it once was and it isn't

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,870
isn't just about the metrics metrics

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,970
play a part yes you always need to have

00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:49,220
metrics to understand whether the

00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,690
automation succeeded or or how many

00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,160
defects we've we've leaked into

00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:56,510
production there's useful stuff there

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,890
but it's not just about that and testing

00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,740
it shouldn't be seen as an isolated

00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:02,180
activity in an ideal world testing an

00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,650
engineered testing will should be part

00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,890
of an engineering team and it's all part

00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:08,120
of a every cycle that isn't the case

00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:10,310
everywhere there's still a lot of

00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,130
companies that have separate test

00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:15,440
organizations or they're they're not

00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,780
even in a matrix management process that

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,700
they have a direct testing channel dev

00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,340
channel and they don't really cross over

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:24,020
that isn't the norm as far as I see it

00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,670
anymore there are more companies that

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,960
are moving to a more agile devops

00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:30,230
approach where everyone's working

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,380
together as I say it's still the way in

00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:35,510
some organizations so for me what do we

00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,970
need from a test manager so in the world

00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,779
of agile devops where the teams are more

00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,959
collaborative

00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:44,329
what do we need from a test leader I've

00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:46,309
got three things so the first thing is

00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:48,890
to advocate and champion quality and

00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:50,869
testing best processes I've borrowed

00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,719
this diagram from Louise Gibbs who are

00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:55,789
believes on the call really simple

00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,799
diagram that I've actually shared with

00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:59,509
leadership in easyJet and they like it

00:39:57,799 --> 00:40:02,390
they understand what quality is from

00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:04,339
this so I've used this to sort of show

00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,679
that there are ways to talk about

00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:09,380
quality that the customer understands

00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:10,729
the business understands so find a way

00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,749
to communicate that in it in the

00:40:10,729 --> 00:40:13,219
language that the business will

00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:16,249
understand and this diagram is a good

00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:17,749
example of that get testing or quality

00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:19,489
at the table for discussions earlier on

00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:21,439
again I talked about shifting left and

00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:24,739
get in testing at the table with

00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:26,269
testability for requirements that gets a

00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:28,999
test that took the quality voice from

00:40:26,269 --> 00:40:30,589
the very beginning and it's really

00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:33,289
important to show the value of good

00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:34,759
quality talk about especially in your

00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:36,589
industry I mean the airline industry

00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:39,049
there's a few examples in the past with

00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:41,239
with baggage systems and aircraft

00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:43,909
software that's failed show that show

00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:45,799
the the value of good quality by talking

00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:47,569
about some of the failures of the past

00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:48,919
and how we can ensure that doesn't

00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:52,039
happen in our and our current

00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:53,779
environment and get quality in the minds

00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,400
of the business from an early point so

00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:57,079
they understand the need for it so that

00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,949
we don't get bad customer feedback and

00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:03,949
bad bad reputation because of the

00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:06,049
quality of our software the next thing

00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:07,729
is to build effective and passionate

00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:10,939
team so nurture and grow your teams

00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:14,299
treat them all as individuals so the

00:41:10,939 --> 00:41:16,249
thing here is make sure that you don't

00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:17,749
treat two people in the same way there

00:41:16,249 --> 00:41:21,199
may be some people in your team that

00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:22,880
like the the direct and blunt

00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:24,919
instructions there's others that might

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,499
need it fluffing up and a different way

00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:29,029
of communicating don't set yourself out

00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:31,459
to have just one style for everybody

00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:32,659
make sure that you use different styles

00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:34,339
for different people the same with one

00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:36,140
two ones maybe some ones ones need to be

00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:38,929
more structured with some people others

00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:42,589
can be more informal because they they

00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:43,729
they they work in a different way and

00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:45,409
their passions come out in a different

00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:47,650
way so you have to find the best way to

00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:49,720
make them as effective as possible

00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,280
helped them buy into your values if you

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,560
can get your team learning your values

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,740
then it really helps you to move forward

00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,930
as an organization and help help give

00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,730
them a voice as I mentioned before

00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:02,140
empowering them and evangelizing for

00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,400
them gives them the confidence and they

00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,780
can step forward and say they're not

00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,980
happy with something or they can step

00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,950
forward and say they are happy with

00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,690
something and it gives it gives them all

00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:14,260
individual voices rather than you be in

00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:17,170
the solitary voice for the team and as I

00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:19,000
say be their biggest evangelist you know

00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,190
be the one that shouts and rooftops for

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,750
the work they're doing show them that

00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,120
you're you're their biggest supporter

00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:28,060
and it will change the dynamic of the

00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,440
team you're working with and the final

00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:32,710
thing really for a test leader is the

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,050
servant leadership side so how can I

00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:37,870
help it's a phrase that I tend to use in

00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,190
my one to ones you know what what is it

00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:41,110
I can do for you at this point is there

00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,820
anything you need from me you know how

00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:45,730
can I support you all these kind of

00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:48,690
phrases helps them to learn that you're

00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:53,380
there for them coach and facilitate them

00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:56,710
that makes help them make be the best

00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:58,990
they can to move forward and try not to

00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:01,540
impart too much of the way that you

00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:04,960
would do it on them give them the tools

00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:06,880
to learn how to test effectively don't

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,050
necessarily try and push them down the

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,490
same way that you would have done it

00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:12,310
because everyone does things differently

00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:14,050
and the beauty of testing is that we

00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,820
need a team of individuals rather than a

00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:18,580
team of people doing everything the same

00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:20,110
way and and that's certainly the way

00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,620
that I would move forward and ultimately

00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:24,850
trust them you know they're your team

00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:27,120
you have to have the trust in them that

00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:30,400
they will do the best job they can

00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:33,520
so just to just before we finish a few a

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,110
few books and podcasts that I've been

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,130
inspired by for this I don't know why

00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,600
they've not quite worked the way I

00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,010
should have done but from a book

00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,500
perspective there's three books that

00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:43,540
have really helped me the manager's path

00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,120
which is by Camille Fournier is a

00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,010
literally chapter by chapter takes you

00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,840
through going from an individual

00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:51,970
contributor who does a bit of coaching

00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,940
and mentoring to a tech lead to a

00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:57,190
manager to a director to a VP so you

00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:59,800
know it has what you chapters on each

00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,460
area of a it talks from an engineering

00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,349
perspective software engineering

00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,270
but we can apply a lot of that to

00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,940
testing or engineering management across

00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:09,859
Devon tests as well

00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:13,880
managing the test people looks at it in

00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:16,309
a bit more of a test a test manager

00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,530
perspective but again some really good

00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:20,059
concepts in that book and leading

00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:24,109
quality as well which is the recent book

00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:25,640
from Ron Cummings and rapier talks about

00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:28,910
how to get your quality narrative

00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,680
correct within the business get quality

00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,720
at the table get people thinking about

00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,030
quality building out your testing

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,260
getting automation the right places it

00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,790
just helps you understand the full

00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,790
picture of where testing and quality is

00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:42,349
needed and then as I'm an avid podcast

00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:44,530
this notice for that I would call out

00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:47,270
other than my own of course

00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:50,180
simple leadership christian McCarrick

00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:53,270
he's a VP of engineering in the States

00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,220
and he has VPS and CTOs and other

00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,809
engineering managers on there talking

00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,180
about management talk about leadership

00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:01,940
talking about different concepts within

00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:04,910
the hiring process or how to build

00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:07,040
effective engineering teams some really

00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,869
useful concepts they're testing in the

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,609
pub with Dan Ashby and Stephen Jana way

00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:12,049
some really good episodes there on

00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:14,390
leadership as well as on testing

00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:16,490
concepts testing one-to-one with Rob

00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:19,910
Lambert and Joel wants of Felicity I'm

00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:21,079
probably brutal and before we destroyed

00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,030
his name there but I apologies for that

00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:25,130
but they talk about lots of testing

00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:27,770
concepts and then the quality coaching

00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:29,599
Roadshow with Amory charit and Margaret

00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:31,630
Dineen there's some really good talks

00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,130
there as well on on how to build quality

00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:38,000
cultures how to coach quality in

00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:39,349
different organisations and that's me

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,119
I've done lots of talking

00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:44,329
I apologize for probably going over

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,530
slightly I've got my blog I've got

00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:47,119
personal blog and then I've got the

00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:48,260
podcast link there as well if any of you

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,079
want to read that's some of the stuff

00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,849
we've written and and the the podcast

00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,290
we've done but thank you for letting me

00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:58,040
talk and I'm happy to answer a few

00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:00,530
questions as a great talk so a couple of

00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,520
questions have been queuing up so I'll

00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,200
try and get through as many as possible

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,510
something you guys go see off no worries

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,339
at all so if you want to use either the

00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:10,880
raise hand function just play the

00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:14,210
participants on the side or chat in the

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,160
chat box so first question was from John

00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:20,440
fees if it's

00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:26,920
find it how do you build a learning

00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:30,160
culture that's an interesting one I mean

00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:32,260
the way I've tried to build it is make

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,450
learning a fun thing to do don't make it

00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:38,500
a prescribed thing give them the

00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:39,790
opportunity to you know share stuff with

00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,320
them on a regular basis always I've

00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:43,870
always been one for sharing webinars

00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,240
sharing conference talks sharing blogs

00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:48,160
sharing articles that are interests to

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,320
me that I think might be of interest to

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,890
them around testing quality leadership

00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,000
etc etc and encourage them not

00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:56,140
everyone's gonna pay take it up

00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,640
straightaway and there might be one

00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,870
article every so often that piques

00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:03,160
someone's interest giving them the

00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,390
opportunity giving them the time so

00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,000
don't have to learn in their own time as

00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:09,400
well so maybe a lot of companies have

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,050
adopted this Google time or you know

00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,420
half a day a day a month where they can

00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:16,510
do their own projects that that does

00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:18,580
help lead the culture of learning if

00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,870
it's not too prescribed and mandated

00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:22,630
that you have to do it on a certain day

00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:25,540
or over time so try and be flexible and

00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:28,240
give plenty of opportunities to to learn

00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,280
stuff share things make books available

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,530
so I always take all my books into the

00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,030
office so they're there on my desk or

00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,650
around my desk so people feel they can

00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,820
just pick them up and read them because

00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,050
people learn in different ways as well

00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,550
some people are like picking up a book

00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:41,440
some people want to watch an online

00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,210
course some people want to come and sit

00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,130
and sit with you and ask you about

00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,540
exploratory testing and you can you can

00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,740
talk to them about your experiences and

00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,460
trying to help move it forward so

00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,870
there's different ways for different

00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,190
people but it's about putting the

00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:54,180
options on the table and labeling people

00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:56,500
to choose the way that works for them

00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:58,870
that says that she'd love to hear more

00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,060
about testing peers podcast was a

00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:04,690
feedback being like what was all the

00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:06,370
future episodes be about so feedback so

00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,170
far has been pretty good and we've only

00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,820
had the two episodes what first episode

00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,500
we we just introduced ourselves and

00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,420
talked about our journeys to where we

00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,520
are and talked about our favorite bugs

00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,730
the second episode we focused on one two

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,110
ones and how to make them effective

00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:22,720
episode three we've already recorded and

00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,430
that's all about empowering teams an

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,930
episode four we've already recorded as

00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,410
well which is all about cognitive bias

00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,880
in testing and

00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:31,400
and making sure we try and look at that

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,520
so there's the first few topics we're

00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:38,450
open to feedback open to topic

00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:40,940
suggestions if you want to add topics to

00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:43,339
our ongoing Trello board then either

00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,619
email as at contact as testing peers

00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:48,440
calm or at testing peers on Twitter and

00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:51,380
we can we can respond and add stuff to

00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,839
our Trello board of topics but yeah we

00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:56,059
intend it to be about leadership and

00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,170
also testing but almost testing from a

00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:58,700
leadership perspective does that make

00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,220
sense so we're not necessarily talking

00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,869
about how teams should do something but

00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,789
more about our experience as a leader

00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:06,950
and helping our team to do those things

00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:08,809
but you know we'll see how it goes

00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:12,500
there's four of us on it every every

00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:15,799
time we record it just tended we're

00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:18,230
trying to make it as light-hearted and

00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:21,020
easy to listen to as possible but still

00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:22,490
be invaluable so we only had two

00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,289
episodes we've only had about 150

00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:26,000
downloads I think as well so far but the

00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:28,430
feedback so far from people that we know

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,140
of listen there's been positive so yeah

00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:33,740
by all means reach out if you have any

00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,510
more questions about it Robert says how

00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:38,329
much does organize a little national

00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:40,819
culture affects how you manage mcafee

00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:43,010
for instance sounds way more forward and

00:49:40,819 --> 00:49:45,710
he's worked in and he was a civil

00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:50,569
servant 30 yes how open were they to

00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:52,880
change was that part of the problem so

00:49:50,569 --> 00:49:57,200
as with all big corporates change is

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:59,630
slow and changes sometimes targeted at

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,880
the wrong levels so the bottom level so

00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:05,660
that sorry that makes it sound terrible

00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:07,490
for the team level the teams might adopt

00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,539
agile for instance but individual teams

00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,609
and individual pockets for the

00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:12,349
organization adopting agile doesn't help

00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:15,079
the whole business move to an at the

00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:16,430
right Angela model so change was in

00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:20,599
pockets different teams were further

00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:23,750
ahead than others there's certainly a

00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:25,569
lot of forward-thinking areas DevOps a

00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:28,160
lot of the process was in place before

00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:30,410
before the term develops was coined in

00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,980
some respects or at least become widely

00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:37,400
used having pipelines in Jenkins and

00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:38,809
testing or hooked off that was some of

00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,210
the teams in McAfee had had for years

00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:47,000
but it hadn't been formally made into

00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:49,450
a process it's I think sometimes this

00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,640
conception there's a misconception that

00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:54,050
whole companies afford thing in but it

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,820
really was there was different pockets

00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:58,730
at different places and the teams I

00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:00,470
worked in some of the teams were were

00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,090
very forward with the automation other

00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,440
teams were less though it depended on

00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,970
the individuals in the area there wasn't

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,820
an overall process across the

00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:09,890
organization everyone had to do this

00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,690
which can sometimes be damaging and

00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:13,370
sometimes works but yeah it was

00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,350
certainly pockets of really good

00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:18,800
experience and pockets have not so far

00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:20,720
for other organizations I've worked in

00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,280
like I say that the waterfall team I

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,550
went to there was next to no automation

00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,830
in place at all so that was a bit of a

00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,720
change and trying to understand how we

00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:32,180
get from a very manual process and very

00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,980
manual tests and thousands of tests run

00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,320
at the end of a cycle to building that

00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,940
quality and the value in earlier so we

00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:42,680
don't have to run so many tests at the

00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:44,780
end and cultures are kind of you can

00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,880
change them through little things and

00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,800
that that culture was certainly easier

00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,300
to change than the one at McAfee the

00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,060
McAfee culture that we had within the

00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:55,280
teams was very forward-thinking but

00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,840
there was also that aspect of if you

00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,570
tried to change too much people dug

00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:03,250
their heels in where as I felt I had

00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:03,250
more influence in my second organization

00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,640
Katherine says have you taken any formal

00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:12,440
training and do you have any test

00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:15,620
management qualifications yeah I did the

00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:18,320
ist key be advanced test manager and I

00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:22,280
actually found it more useful than I

00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:24,050
thought at the time I didn't find it as

00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,420
useful as I realized afterwards because

00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:32,900
at the time the course was very focused

00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:36,170
on non agile processes so being a test

00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:38,630
manager managing your team identifying

00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:41,210
the risks right in the reports etc etc

00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:42,740
but there's a lot of although the topics

00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:44,330
might sound very old-fashioned there was

00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,250
a lot of nuggets within the course that

00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:49,520
were really useful certainly around risk

00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:53,510
management certainly around team

00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,430
dynamics some of the quality aspects as

00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:57,589
well and leading a team

00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:58,970
on coaching and mentoring for tests

00:52:57,589 --> 00:53:00,950
techniques and stuff like that there was

00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:05,089
some useful content I wouldn't say it's

00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:06,859
necessarily needed I think a lot more

00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:09,500
benefit would come from doing a straight

00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:11,630
up leadership course and learning how to

00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,760
do coaching and mentoring and then using

00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:16,579
your skill set from being an active

00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:20,150
tester with that experience of being the

00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:22,069
lead and to help you build it up into a

00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:23,569
management role I'd I think the biggest

00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:25,460
things for a manager is learning all the

00:53:23,569 --> 00:53:27,829
people's guide things all the admin side

00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:29,990
I think technical wise I think if you've

00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:31,400
got a good technical ability and you can

00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:33,410
learn how to coach a mentor your team

00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,530
then you can be a successful manager I

00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:38,059
don't think the agile testament and the

00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:41,059
advanced test manager is necessarily

00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:45,950
needed personally but as I say I found

00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:47,240
it useful well great sue says what are

00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:49,430
your thoughts and hiring contract

00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,990
testers for your projects what the chose

00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:55,640
that you faced in hiring them so

00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:57,800
certainly in my last two organizations

00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,349
easyJet and the one before we have had

00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:07,069
big consultant teams offshore and

00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:11,030
onshore and I personally I would i've

00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:12,380
always liked to have a core perm team

00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:14,059
that I'm working with but I certainly

00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,819
feel that if we need to ramp up quickly

00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:18,020
and have for a bigger project we need to

00:54:16,819 --> 00:54:20,180
double the amount of people or

00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:23,690
particular people in the team I would

00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:25,130
certainly reach out to use contractors

00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:27,140
in that perspective perspective I

00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:29,270
certainly see value in them it's

00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:32,510
bringing a new a new new set of eyes and

00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:33,829
new ideas into an organization but

00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,579
there's always that need for them to hit

00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:36,500
the ground running

00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:38,119
whereas I also like the opportunity to

00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,309
nurture and build my team from scratch

00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:41,990
and and build that team up and I see a

00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:46,160
place for contractors to help me build

00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:48,950
the team up but I certainly like to have

00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,260
my own firm team that I'm effectively

00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:53,319
managing looking after if that makes

00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,319
sense

00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:58,670
got two questions from to hear you've

00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:01,700
been transitions to a new role where

00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,980
your boss is what think so and he or she

00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:07,299
is still juniors and only role how would

00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,299
you be more in sync with your boss

00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:15,500
well I question if you've been moved

00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:17,059
into a new role your boss should have

00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,710
been part of that agreement to put you

00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:19,819
in that role in the first place so they

00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,920
should be brought in to why you were

00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:23,750
there but if they're not then it's about

00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,280
having open conversations with what

00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:27,640
they're expecting from you and what

00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,140
you're expecting from the new role and

00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:32,869
trying to put some level of value in

00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:36,799
place of of how you prove your value and

00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:38,539
how you can influence them that what

00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:49,309
you're doing is the right thing if that

00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:54,170
makes sense yeah we got any more

00:55:49,309 --> 00:56:03,260
questions guys and girls I've offered

00:55:54,170 --> 00:56:05,089
quite a lot there that's that thing okay

00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,380
right and thank you so much sounds a

00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:07,579
