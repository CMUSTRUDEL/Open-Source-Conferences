Title: Taiko: Reliable Browser Automation: An Introduction | Lunchtime Sessions | QA Babble - June 2020
Publication date: 2020-06-25
Playlist: QA Babble
Description: 
	This Lunchtime Session was organised by Woodrow Mercer and presented on YouTube by Pusher via Zoom Webinar relay.

There is a lot of talk in the software industry today about browser automation tools like Cypress, Puppeteer, WebDriver, TestCafe, and TestProject. Yet nobody seems to be talking about Taiko, an automation tool from Thoughtworks, the company that created Selenium and WebDriver. In this talk Amit will take you through some of the key features of Taiko and why he feels you should consider this simple yet powerful tool. Zabil from Thoughtworks will also be on hand in the webinar to assist with the Q&A element at the end of the talk.
