"The Value of Testers in DevOps", with Ali Hill

Overview:
All too often, software testers are labeled as a bottleneck in DevOps environments. In a world where we are aiming to release frequently, what value do software testers provide? What activities can they, and the team, carry out in order to ensure we are releasing high quality software?

There is a focus on automating as much as possible when working in a team practicing a DevOps culture. The same applies to testing. Alan Page (Director, Unity) once said “You should automate 100% of the tests that should be automated.” But what about the other, human-focused activities, that are required to build a quality product?

Testing the ideas or design of the functionality being developed in order to prevent bugs, coaching other team members on the types of tests that they should write in order to build quality into the product and performing exploratory testing to discover unknowns of the system under test. These are just some of the ways in which testers can add value to a team practicing DevOps.

In this talk I will draw upon my own experiences of working as a tester within DevOps teams and share the value-add activities that I have practiced and successes I have experienced. I would like to expand on the industry term "Continuous Testing" and demonstrate that it's not just about automated tests.

Testing is way more than automating requirement checks. Testers are critical in mitigating risks in the solution teams are developing.
