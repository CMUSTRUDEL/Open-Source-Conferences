The Future of testing: How can we be prepared?
Stuart Day

"Testing and the role of testers and test managers has dramatically changed over the years. As technology and ways of working have evolved, so has the role of the testers and test managers in teams. But what does the future hold and how can we prepare ourselves for it? In this talk, I share my views on

1. How things have changed
2. What the future may hold?
3. How we can adapt ourselves to be ready?
4. Why I think working in the world of Quality/Testing makes us extremely privileged :)"
