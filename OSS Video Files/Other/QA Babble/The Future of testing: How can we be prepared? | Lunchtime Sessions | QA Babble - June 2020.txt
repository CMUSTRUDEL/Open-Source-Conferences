The Future of testing: How can we be prepared?
Stuart Day

"Testing and the role of testers and test managers has dramatically changed over the years. As technology and ways of working have evolved, so has the role of the testers and test managers in teams. But what does the future hold and how can we prepare ourselves for it? In this talk, I share my views on

1. How things have changed
2. What the future may hold?
3. How we can adapt ourselves to be ready?
4. Why I think working in the world of Quality/Testing makes us extremely privileged :)"

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,360
if you haven't seen back to the future

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,839
highly recommend you do

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,279
um so firstly what i want to do is i

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,320
want to talk about

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,399
how things have changed over time so as

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,600
i mentioned i've been in the industry

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,720
for uh 23 years um

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,200
and like a lot of people actually um

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,160
i kind of just fell into testing and

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
quality

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,440
and so what i want to do is i i want to

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,920
take us back so we're going to look at

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,720
the

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
tech almanac okay so i want to take us

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,519
back

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,000
to first of september

00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:01,839
1997 at nine o'clock in the morning

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,680
okay so this was the first role i've

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,200
been out of college for a year

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,959
i've been i've done a role around

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,440
being a systems administrator for a

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,200
company on a youth training scheme which

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,120
didn't quite work out very well

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
um and i was out of work for a little

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,079
bit and

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,680
i found this role being advertised in

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,079
um in the window of a recruitment agency

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,120
in

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,760
our local town and it was for a uat

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
analyst

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,040
and i was like oh that sounds

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,760
interesting read the description thought

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,040
yeah i could i could do that applied and

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,360
got the role

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,720
didn't really know what a uat analyst

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,760
was to be fair

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,200
um so turned up on my first day jumped

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,800
on public transport

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,320
with my bus timetable in my bag um

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,399
got got to the office and i was a bit

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320
like um okay so

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,920
what is this role didn't really have a

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,399
clue around what testing was didn't

00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,000
really have clue about what uat was

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,639
um but what this was my intro

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,360
into a lot of you know where i am today

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,760
um

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,480
and and i was at this organization for

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,519
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,240
13 years um i learnt my trade there but

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,720
also

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,079
you know um i progressed into a number

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,920
of different roles

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,200
and over that time technology changed

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,320
massively

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,600
so the company i worked for was company

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,959
called oag

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,160
and they were still around now they they

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,079
uh publish airline schedules um and

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,440
do a lot of other things as well now but

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,320
they're big in the airline scheduling

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,760
industry

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,639
um and the day i um started there

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,279
some of the tech that we were using was

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,040
well

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,480
some people may not even recognize some

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,519
of the tech that i've got on this slide

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,519
right now

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,959
the you know the technology we we were

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,839
we had an ibm as400 mainframe um

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,760
big old thing you know we had green

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,279
screen vdus

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,079
um i remember it was only the the the

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,000
supervisors at the time that had a pc so

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,680
if you wanted to do anything on a pc you

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,120
had to go and speak to the supervisor to

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,760
actually be able to do that

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,480
um and the primary focus then was very

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,440
much around

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,320
printing these um these guides here the

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,079
flight guide the

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,399
worldwide flight guide um and

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,720
we we often had to look at printouts and

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,800
we were utilizing things like these line

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,720
printers and i remember printing out

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,959
these documents and having to go through

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,880
line by line you know checking to make

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
sure that the the content of the thing

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,440
was right

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,800
and you know marking where it was wrong

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,839
and all this kind of thing

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,680
but one of the things that um

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,959
for me what joining this organization

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,600
was i i

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,320
trained up very very uh for the first

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,399
few weeks

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
couple of months really around the

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,040
systems and

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,519
the technology they were using but i

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,880
still didn't really have a a real good

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,360
idea of what

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
you know uat analyst was or what testing

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,079
really was

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:04,160
um and gradually obviously

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,680
um that kind of became a bit more of a

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,880
self-learn thing

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,240
um you know we we um often

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,959
pull people in from from within the

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,480
organization um which really kind of

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,079
you know obviously didn't get knowledge

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,360
in from the outside but we learned our

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,279
trade internally

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,120
and kind of worked on on what was best

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
for us so you know you're looking at

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,639
technologies here that

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,160
you know these would be great in a

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
museum nowadays

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,680
um there's a fax machine here if anybody

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,120
hasn't had seen a fax machine well i

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,839
believe messi uses one

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,199
um there's a fax machine um you know

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,480
there's a desktop phone

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,600
wow and you know as as 13 years was a

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,519
long time to be in this

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,040
this company so technology obviously

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,360
moved on but

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,760
it still still was quite limited to be

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,639
fair in terms of how much technology

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,720
as a company we were kind of targeting

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,959
and what our customers were using

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,639
and we had some pda devices where we

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,920
were uploading

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,560
timetable information to one of the very

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,880
first

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,160
well potentially one of the very first

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,279
smartphones

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,720
um it was the the spv where we were

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,720
looking at how we could do

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,720
sms alerting for flight status

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,519
information and that kind of stuff

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,560
um but even then the technology didn't

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,079
seem to be

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,760
especially for our customers didn't seem

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,040
to move on that quickly

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,920
um so you know it was 13 years where

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,000
things

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,680
within this organization stood quite

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,480
still in terms of tech

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,440
um and obviously i continued to learn my

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,639
trade there

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,320
and our ways of working were very very

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,839
well what we've classed nowadays as

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,519
legacy um

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,000
i mean to be fair when i when i was

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,360
there i didn't even really know that we

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,440
were doing waterfall i didn't know what

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,040
waterfall really was when i started

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,279
um it was only over time we kind of

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,920
obviously realized how we were working

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,120
um everything was was manual everything

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,519
was testing it was

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,959
you know um manual testing you know even

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,240
even to the point of you know if we

00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,880
wanted to test something performance

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720
related

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,000
we'd get a stopwatch out and we would

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,720
see how long it takes to

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,880
load a file or you know run run a run a

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,560
test or something that kind of thing

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,800
and the big thing obviously you know

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,600
we're always always being squeezed for

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,480
time

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,279
in terms of how you know these big

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,560
projects

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,600
um you know the that we would invest

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,160
time and money in

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,920
and always end up having to squeeze time

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,120
at the end to make sure that

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,639
you know we we did enough testing um to

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,959
make sure we hit a deadline

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,240
um i think one of the projects we worked

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,120
on

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,680
um was quoted to be two years it ended

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,759
up being

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,360
five years that was a re-platform to

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,720
come off the mainframe

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
you know those kind of things were

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,959
really really evident back then

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,199
um and you know in terms of our ways of

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,399
working they didn't really evolve

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:53,199
hugely you know we had big specification

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,920
documents um everything was kind of

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,279
handoffs

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,040
one of the things that did play to our

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,160
advantage was we had

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,040
our it team was quite small so even

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,480
though

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,319
you know we did have these handoffs and

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,839
we worked in this way we were able to

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,640
speak to our developers

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,600
if we chose to um and obviously you know

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,360
because

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,880
the team was small it was easier to kind

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,559
of communicate in that way

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,400
but it was very much you know we were

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,439
still classed as the gatekeepers

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,760
equality

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,280
even throughout that whole 13-year

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,799
period that i was there

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,319
um and you know we we kind of

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,240
looked and tried to work a bit more

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,720
collaboratively in some ways

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,240
but it didn't quite you know evolve as

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,200
quickly as potentially things

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,559
evolve nowadays um the one thing

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,480
obviously you can see there as well

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,880
we even though we were working in this

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,960
way we did still use post-its

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,720
so we were quite advanced with posters

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,320
right because everybody uses post-its

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,080
still do um so what i want to do is just

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,919
jump forward very very quickly now

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,919
um to um

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,320
august i think it was august 23rd i mean

00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,280
james or who's on the call who was my

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,520
manager at this time

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,799
maybe i'd correct me on this but i think

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,760
it was around about that time

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,720
august 23rd 2010 when i joined easyjet

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,799
um

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,480
and the reason i joined easyjet was very

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,960
much because

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,360
as i mentioned previously the the the

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,360
the technology and the ways of working

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,440
weren't evolving very quickly

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,880
um within the organization that i was

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,160
working with

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,880
and outside i was very

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,280
aware that things were moving forward

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
and i

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,400
obviously had a new people in the

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,280
industry of testing and software

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,520
development

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,200
and you know the the talk then was all

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,440
around agile and

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,559
you know this is the great new thing and

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,520
and it's how

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,760
quickly technology was moving along and

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,760
i needed to make a decision in terms of

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,440
okay do i stay where i am because i was

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,280
in a test manager's role

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,200
i was literally five minutes walk away

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,240
from my house as well which was always

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,039
very nice

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,240
um or do i take and take the you know

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,520
the challenge

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,919
and you know almost take

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,200
a a kind of a step back in terms of

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,400
become a test analyst

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,520
to relearn my trade um but also step out

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,760
of my comfort zone so

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,520
i was still in the airline industry but

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,320
moving into an e-commerce

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,840
world now one of the things you know if

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,520
you're a back to the future fan

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,880
you know around about this time we would

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,520
have been expecting

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,160
things like hoverboards and and flying

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,559
cars

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,760
but no unfortunately that wasn't the

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,760
case at all

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,120
um i had to drive to work i did have a

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,280
car by then which was lovely

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,200
um but i still had to drive to work and

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,440
yeah the best thing i think i had i had

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,880
an old skateboard but yeah never rode it

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,919
um so coming into easyjet was a real

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,880
eye-opener for me

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,039
and um you know the technologies that we

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,919
were sort of facing into over and i was

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,640
easyjet roughly around almost four years

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,360
um

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,080
and it was really eye-opening to me in

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,559
terms of

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,360
you know the technology um over that

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,400
time and how

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,080
technology changed um and how ways of

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,520
working kind of evolved and how how

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,400
different they were from what i've been

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,799
used to for

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,200
for 13 years so coming into easyjet um

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,960
you know you and can i just say if

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,559
you've never worked for an airline

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,000
work for an airline you know i know

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,559
they've not had a great time of it over

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,679
the last

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,440
x amount of months with everything

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,720
that's been going on but it is a really

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,280
great

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
place you know great opportunity to um

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,000
to work

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,679
um because it really kind of opens up

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,720
your eyes to a number of things

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,240
um yeah we we had to face into

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,080
you know a number of different

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,960
technologies um

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,799
and you know we were obviously you know

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,799
the primary thing is all around flight

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,640
reservations and booking online

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,080
and making sure our passengers get into

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,919
the air on time

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,600
um and you know we over time we had to

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,640
face into things like

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,679
you know the um mobile phones we we

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,600
um obviously facing into the

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,840
different browsers which i wasn't used

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,000
to from necessarily from from the time i

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,080
spent with oag it was that was very much

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,200
you know different types of of

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,360
applications and

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,120
and technologies we were using there but

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,000
they weren't really customer facing in

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,840
this way

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,520
so it's a really kind of eye opener for

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,400
me in terms of how we would approach

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,280
things

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,679
um and also you know the potential risk

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,320
of

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,600
you know issues going through into our

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,400
production environments

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,200
um so you know we we kind of looked at

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,440
things like

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,799
um are there obviously the boarding

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,919
passes

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,880
um we we implemented um allocated

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,760
seating he's

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,520
allocated seating um and and steve and

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,640
james who are on on this call right now

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,039
we know all about the

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,919
the fun we had with that um yeah we all

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,159
faced into

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,159
mobile apps you know the easyjet app

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,440
launched during that time as well

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,440
um and also you know cloud so we we

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,720
as part of the allocated seating project

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,000
we we invested

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,480
and moved that piece of uh functionality

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,320
into resort cloud as well um so all

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,240
these things started to

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,679
start to take shape um and you know we

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,000
whereas i was saying we were doing

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:10,159
things um very manually

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,400
um at um reg when i was there

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,400
um things were moving on easyjet so we

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,520
were looking at more automated means of

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,480
doing things so

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,880
automated testing um we had you know

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,440
more

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,000
robust performance testing that we were

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,240
would do

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,679
via third parties that were formed you

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,280
know part of our day today

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,120
or our sprint to sprint um and you know

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,679
everybody loves jira right so we we we

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,440
were using you know jira as well

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,039
um that was tongue-in-cheek by the way

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,200
if anybody didn't hear that um

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,799
so you know we were kind of you know it

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,320
was it was really great to kind of be

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,120
working in different ways with different

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,159
technologies

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,960
in terms of our ways of working um we

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,240
were

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,400
um working in in

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,559
utilizing scrum so we were working in

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,360
sprints um

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,960
we had our our board set up uh we were

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,600
using user stories

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,480
for for um determining what it was that

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,600
we wanted to

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,200
to deliver uh we started looking at

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,960
things like bdd

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
and this was where i first came in

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,240
contact with bdd

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,280
i think you know all the learnings i

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,760
took from

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,280
what we did a a easyjet from the start

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,440
of looking at bdd

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,320
you know obviously we we kind of

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,840
probably got it wrong

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,360
to start with because we were very much

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,159
looking at utilizing bdd as an

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,240
automation

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,200
mechanism rather than the collaborative

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,080
mechanism

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,840
um and you know but they're all lessons

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,760
learned and they're great lessons

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,919
um it was a much more collaborative

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,280
environment and we still did have the

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,000
the kind of the devs

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,640
and the testers tested kind of approach

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,080
um

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,159
but it was a much more collaborative

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,039
environment because we were working in

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,320
in you know instagram so we talked more

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,480
we sat at the same desk

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,480
you know that kind of thing um we did

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,200
invest as i mentioned we did invest in

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,520
in automation um but again it was very

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,279
ui driven a lot of what we did then was

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,799
very focused at the ui

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,400
um not so much at the unit test level

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,960
but it was really great to kind of be

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,200
working somewhere that was trying to

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,720
do these things and and learn from them

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,360
as well

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,200
um and you know we were looking at

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,840
things like how we did more exploratory

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,840
testing

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,279
and you know regression and you know uh

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,159
performance and you know as i mentioned

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,279
before

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,880
but we we were still kind of

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,799
uh pretty much the gatekeepers of the

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,279
quality so you know we would sign

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,039
something

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,480
off after you know the sprint to make

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,880
sure the teams are happy we would sign

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,400
stuff off at the end of a a regression

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,400
to make sure we could release

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,559
and actually our release processes were

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,440
still very manual as well

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,600
so you know our releases would be uh

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,880
from 10 p.m i think roughly 10 p.m to

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,679
like 4 a.m

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,360
um on a particular evening and we'd have

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,760
to take all our systems down

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,799
including our reservation system and

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,600
deploy everything

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,360
because we had big monoliths and then

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,360
bring it all back up and i remember like

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,440
you know some some evenings we'd be

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,600
still we'd kind of overrun and we'd be

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,760
looking out the the hangar

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,679
window into the car park and seeing

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,360
customers turning up at the airport

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,960
ready for the first wave of checking and

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,159
we still hadn't got the reservation

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,000
system back up and that's

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,919
that's quite pressure um quite a lot of

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,279
pressure to be under on during a during

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,919
the release

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,520
um so things were you know whilst whilst

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,440
um

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,360
you know obviously we were we were

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,960
moving in direction still sometimes it

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,320
felt like we were kind of

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,320
moving a little bit slower sprints were

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,840
three weeks we then did kind of one to

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,600
two weeks regression on some stuff

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,880
because there was so much to do

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,799
that's why we tried to invest in

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,240
automation which did speed things up

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,640
but then we had a lot of maintenance

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,840
around those things as well

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,520
um and i say i was there for for about

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,559
four years oh also guess what we use

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,159
post-its

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,720
um so i was there for around about four

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,559
years and then um

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,000
moved on somewhere else but what i want

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,360
to do is i want to bring you more

00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
to the now so

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,360
how so if you look at how technology and

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,559
ways of working have kind

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,720
kind of evolved from back in 1997

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,000
um to what i'm showing you here now

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,480
which was between

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,400
2010 and 2014 you can see that there was

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
a lot of change more technologies coming

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,240
in

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,960
more things to think about from a

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,520
quality perspective and as testers you

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,440
know

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,840
trying to learn new things learn new

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,400
trades you know really understand our

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,279
engineering processes and stuff more and

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
more

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,559
and the other thing to think about is

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,279
you know you'll see here on this slide

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,159
is that

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,279
you know the the kanban type board that

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,760
we've got here

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,559
is very much testing was still a phase

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,480
that we did

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,840
and it was often even even through the

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,600
sprints squeezed towards the end

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:49,600
so um let's just fast forward now

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,720
to um oh guess what

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,159
today 7th of september 2020

00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:01,200
at 12 20. well i'm not too far off um

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,200
so what does what does it look like so

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,000
a lot of things have changed in you know

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,919
in this time so from 2014 to now which

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,520
is only six years

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,159
um that's a good job i'm good at math

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,279
because that would have looked

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,159
embarrassing

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,360
um you know there's a hell of a lot of

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,200
things that have changed i mean

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,799
the last few months things have changed

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,880
massively anyway

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,919
you know there's a we're all working

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,600
more remotely

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,520
so therefore we're more reliant on

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,760
remote technology

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,240
um it's kind of impacted our ways of

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,799
working our ways of thinking

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,039
and as as qas and as as testers

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,480
um obviously again we've had to adapt

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,679
we've had to kind of

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,200
we you know for for um people

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,880
the teams are used to sitting next to

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,480
each other and talking you've now got to

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,159
think about how can we continue those

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,640
collaborative ways of working

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,200
um through different means and you know

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,840
things like

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,279
serverless technology you know is such a

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,600
such a big thing now

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,960
um and the cloud is such a big thing now

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,080
that you know all these things kind of

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,480
just

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,360
you know are quite mind-blowing in terms

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,760
of how far

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,600
we've come in in you know times or you

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,720
know in the last six years or so

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,159
um so if we look at what we're doing at

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,080
dunelm at the moment

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,880
in terms of the technologies we're using

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,360
so you know this is this is a messy

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,200
slide

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,720
right but i just wanted to kind of give

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,240
you an example of all the different

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,120
types of technologies we're using

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,120
currently

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,799
um at dunelm and they all have their

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,960
uses right so we're not

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,039
we are trying to phase some stuff out uh

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,080
as you can see we still use sap

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:41,200
um so you know that's something that

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,120
is is a big piece of our architecture

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,880
our legacy architecture but it's fun

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,559
it's fundamental to it pretty much

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,640
everything that we're doing right now

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,679
um so we are looking at how we kind of

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,720
come away from sap

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,760
moving forward um and you know become

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,919
more

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,679
aligned to uh you know how we built our

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,760
digital platform which is

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:04,399
serverless technology microservice um

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,440
all up in the cloud or you know all auto

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,320
scaling yeah

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,080
we've invested in you know fastly as our

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,399
cdn capability

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,200
you know we've built our applications in

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,799
node

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,240
react um you know we we've um spent a

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,320
lot of time

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,320
um with um using using jenkins and and

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,120
well what will we get lab very soon

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,000
to build our pipelines and things like

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,279
that

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,679
but obviously we still got the

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,360
challenges of mobiles we've still got

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,200
the challenges of browsers

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,559
interestingly things have changed from a

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,120
browser perspective

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,000
whereas i think before it was very much

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,240
does it function

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,080
in a browser whereas now a lot of the

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,799
browsers are built on the same

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,480
underlying technology and therefore

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,559
functional testing within browsers

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,799
is probably less important whereas

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,399
visual becomes a much more kind of go-to

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,679
thing these days around

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,279
you know it doesn't visually look

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,600
correct in all these browsers and how

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,600
quickly can i do that

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,120
um obviously you know slack for

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,159
communication we're looking at

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,679
utilizing packed for contract testing

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,279
you know one of the things that you know

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,720
is thrown up for us is that

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,399
i mean being in the world of

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,720
microservices

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,000
it becomes very challenging to once

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,080
they're there

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,279
they're dependent they're independent to

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,080
a degree

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,799
um it does cause many problems in the

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,880
sense of

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,919
how do we test them from an integration

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,600
perspective

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,960
um and ensure that you know they are

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,720
talking to each other correctly you're

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,960
getting the right responses back

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,480
um and you know that's one thing we we

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,399
re-platformed

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,440
at dunelm back in october last year

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:47,200
and it was about an 18-month project

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,039
um excuse me

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,240
and one of the things i when i rejoined

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,880
dunnell

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,399
um beginning of last year we were kind

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,720
of in this mix of

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,559
oh we need to do these big end-to-end

00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,840
tests of all our applications because we

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,919
haven't really done anything

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,360
from an integration perspective to give

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,039
us confidence

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,399
and it kind of reminded me going going

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,559
back you know

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,600
several years of doing those big

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,000
end-to-end

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,120
tests for monolith systems that you

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,559
couldn't really get away from

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,399
whereas we built an application and

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,919
you know built our architecture to

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,840
enable us to test more

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,760
frequently faster feedback those kind of

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,200
things we hadn't utilized it in that way

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,960
so we'd really drop the ball around

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,240
testability um

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,799
and you know whether it was going to

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,960
perform um correctly you know

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,480
for the the volumes of customers that we

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,919
we had coming on board

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,240
you know those kind of things all this

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,480
stuff was still very much

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,519
left towards the end of the of the

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,600
delivery

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,440
even though we we got the architecture

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,360
there to do it much sooner

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,080
so um if i just jump forward to

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,600
kind of how we work at dunno so one of

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,519
the things that come me coming back to

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,080
darnell

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,799
whilst we were doing some good stuff in

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,919
the quality space there was still this

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,360
era of

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,440
devs deved testers tested um

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,039
even though the engineers were were more

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,640
involved and they were more

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:15,200
aware of um more aware of

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,000
the the need for quality let's put it

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,399
that way

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,360
um it's it was still very difficult to

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,760
kind of

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,919
get them aligned in terms of getting

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,720
them to you know be part of the testing

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,440
and

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,120
um think about you know automation um

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,720
but not automate everything or to make

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,200
what you need to automate

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,799
utilizing exploratory testing more you

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,640
know those kind of things

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,919
um and over the last um over the last 18

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,640
months or so

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,440
we've really really focused on trying to

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,519
build

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,519
the the um a culture of quality if you

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,240
like so thinking about quality first

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,799
and really kind of you know um looking

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,840
at how

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,720
our engineers and our our qas

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,240
pair up more you know test early you

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,919
know all that that kind of good

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,919
shift left stuff that you hear about

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,240
which actually is really difficult

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,760
to achieve because it's not just about

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,399
technology that's going to get you there

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,559
it's about

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,480
the mindset and the ways of working

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,880
whereas before we were very much

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,559
you know in in the all pretty much all

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,840
the organizations that i'd worked in

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,840
before it was very much qa was

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,200
pretty much the gatekeeper they'd always

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,159
have the final say as to whether

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,480
something was going to

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,440
be released what we've been trying to

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,799
get to here is

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,600
not about you know having gatekeepers

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,440
but having

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:39,039
you know team ownership around quality

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,679
and focus on prevention of issues rather

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,679
than

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,360
you know finding them and fixing them

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,600
later down the food chain

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,480
now you know i remember conversations

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,399
you know

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,960
that great feeling when when you know

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,279
when you're when you're a tester or a qa

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,159
and you you find a bug and you tell that

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,840
and yeah

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,919
you tell the developer and it's like

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,440
guess what i found a big smile on your

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,559
face just to look at the reaction of the

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,000
developer

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,320
we've all been there you know we've all

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,480
gone how many bugs have you found

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,240
and you know it was it was always it was

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,639
it was a nice warm feeling but when i

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,399
look back at it it's kind of like that's

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,320
probably not the best best kind of

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,599
experience for anybody that's you know

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,440
now starting out they shouldn't be

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,639
thinking in those ways

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,639
um and the you know we really need to

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,399
think about having empathy for

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,560
you know our engineering engineering

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,960
need to think and have empathy for

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,720
you know what we do in the quality space

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,359
um and we need to work more

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,119
you know um more in unison in terms of

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,879
you know bringing these things together

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,960
and really focusing on building the

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,280
quality in as we go

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,159
rather than you know you know assessing

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,240
equality

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,480
you know through testing or checks the

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,159
automated checks and things like that

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,760
and and it's been quite it's it's been

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,240
really interesting to see you know some

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,280
some engineers and some of the qas have

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,800
really kind of just

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,639
done this naturally others have been a

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,320
little bit taking a little bit more time

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,000
some still wrap their arms around it and

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,599
say no testing's my role

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,280
you know you know don't take that away

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,800
from me but it's not really about taking

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,920
anything away from anyone

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,240
it's really trying about be um

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,040
building those cross-functional t-shaped

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,800
um teams

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,079
uh or people within cross-functional

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,920
teams so i've seen

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,359
things like questions going around on

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,160
linkedin and twitter about

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,119
you know what would you do if you're the

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,440
only

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,480
the only tester in a cross-functional

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,000
team well

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,520
to start with you should never be the

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,720
only tester as your team is truly

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,000
cross-functional

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,000
so you know the idea of a

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,920
cross-functional team is everybody will

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,760
can assist in all these different areas

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,560
you may not be the specialist

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,400
but you are able to pick up some testing

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,320
or you can pair of your engineer and

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,400
understand coding and you know

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,640
understand engineering practices

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,240
um so you know we're practicing

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,599
obviously you know really focusing on

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,599
quality first

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,640
you know um utilizing bdd for

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,920
collaboration

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,119
um up front um you know we have we've

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,160
invested heavily in

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,079
in devops as a as a culture um

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,760
and obviously through through the devops

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,320
um

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,720
the devops mechanism if you like um you

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,160
know you can basically test the whole

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,800
every single point um we've invested

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,680
a lot of time and money into you know

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,320
our continuous

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,440
integration delivery and deployment um

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
and it's really been that way as well

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,400
because we we've

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,560
um you know we've kind of gone we've

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,320
taken that slow and one of the other

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,119
things i kind of said to the guys when

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,599
when i returned

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,599
was i think we're trying to go too fast

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,800
uh we were trying to chase continuous

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,800
deployment when

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,880
to be honest we were nowhere near ready

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,680
we didn't have the the quality

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,079
you know to to to push that out we can

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,000
have the

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,440
automation in place to really do those

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,560
verification checks

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,800
we didn't even have the upfront

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,359
collaboration that really kind of would

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,359
would

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,960
embed the quality up front you know

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,400
through the discussions we were having

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,960
and those kind of things

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,440
um so we've kind of grown into that and

00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,280
and

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,640
you know obviously that's created

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,680
different opportunities different

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,720
challenges

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,160
in terms of you know how how we need to

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,440
think about things from a quality

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,400
and testing perspective who's doing it

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,320
um and you know obviously kind of

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,800
letting go a little bit to think you

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,119
know

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,040
i'm not here to raise bugs find bugs i'm

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,839
here to work collaboratively to prevent

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,280
these things

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,040
and build quality in um and you know

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,280
actually we're at the point where you

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,160
know our our qas are

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,599
very much we want our engineers to test

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,599
whereas before we would be like

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,920
no testing is my thing not everybody can

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,839
do testing well

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,119
in today's society pretty much anybody

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,920
can do testing

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,040
they may not be a specialist but you

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,359
know they can do it

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,480
and actually we should be open to that

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,040
um

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,599
so you know we've looked at how we build

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,040
performance into our pipelines whereas

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,119
i mentioned when i was at easyjet we

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,560
used to do performance testing every

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,200
sprint but it was very

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,440
it was kind of separate and we because

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,280
of the application it was very

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,800
troublesome sometimes and you know we've

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,520
got the results late and it was

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,520
challenging

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,119
and anybody that's done any work in

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,720
performance will know

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,880
if you find an issue with performance

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,200
with load or scalability

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,359
they are always the hardest things to

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,880
analyze and unpick

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,800
so you don't really want to be hitting

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,000
them towards the end of a delivery you

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,440
want to be kind of

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,040
facing into those things as early as

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,000
possible

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,960
um so you know we we're trying to kind

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,440
of look at

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,000
how we do things i'm not going to use

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,400
the term best

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,760
practice because i i don't believe in

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,160
the term best practice

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,960
i think you know the practices we

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,440
undertake

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,040
evolve constantly so what may be classes

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,920
best practices today next week will be

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,560
out the window

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,160
so you know it's more around you know

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,839
that continuous improvement

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,160
um we've got a we've got a goal we're

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,720
going after how do we achieve that goal

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,160
um and you know the quality the culture

00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,000
of quality is very much

00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,160
at the center of that so just kind of

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,119
that's kind of um you don't want to give

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,040
you an idea of

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,040
from from my own personal experiences

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,280
right how things have changed and

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,400
through my eyes you know where things

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,480
have evolved and

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,240
you know um where they've not evolved i

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,599
mean look guess what we still use

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,160
posters you know so i said something

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,800
there

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,240
um but you know i think everybody yeah

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,760
everybody's kind of

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,520
will view this differently everybody

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,920
will have different experiences

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,040
you know i you know i've learned in my

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,800
short period as

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,560
doing some contracting i learned a lot

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,200
through banking and how teams are

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,400
working

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,599
and and so on as well um

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,720
so i guess what

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,880
what may the future hold so if one thing

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,760
back to the future too kind of showed us

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,640
was

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,119
it's pretty hard to predict the future

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,040
um

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,640
so we got some stuff right so you can

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,520
see here that you know

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,359
um marty's son was was able to watch

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,000
videos through his glasses well

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,280
google glass came out wasn't overly

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,880
successful but yeah

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,480
we've got facial recognition we've got

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,440
3d films

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,720
again 3d films you know depending on

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,319
whether you're a film buff

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,640
you'll like them or hate them but we

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,720
haven't got flying cars uh and you know

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,000
i think you know everybody that was the

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,200
one thing that everybody was really

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,839
excited about

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,280
the the self-lacing shoes as well i mean

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,720
my daughter would love them right now

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,079
because she's trying to learn how to tie

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,000
their shoes right now so

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,119
she's if she sees this film she'll be

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,880
really disappointed

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,800
um and the hoverboard i mean the

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,720
hoverball is a great example of

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,160
designing something without no really

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,960
knowing how your customer was going to

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,400
use it

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,480
who knew that you couldn't go over a

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,560
lake and hoverboard right

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,520
there you go so in terms of technology

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,760
you know i think and this again this is

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,760
just kind of my take on this right

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,280
um and you can take what you want you

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,720
can you know obviously

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,720
um question me around some of these

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,880
things but my view is obviously

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,240
that there is going to be more cloud and

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,040
serverless tech

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,400
right um i think that's a given um i

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,240
think we're going to see more and more

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,400
infrastructure as code as well

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,720
so we're going to move away from the you

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,480
know the manual configuration stuff and

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,640
start using terraform and kubernetes and

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,720
those kind of things more and more

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,839
um i think ai and ar will continue to

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,359
grow i don't

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,359
it's difficult to say how quickly

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,160
especially ai ai is always an

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,319
interesting one

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,599
and a lot of the the discussions you

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,640
know i've been on some discussions

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,079
around you know um will ai replace

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,000
testing

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,599
well probably not

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,920
and you know it's going to be very very

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,160
advanced to really think for itself and

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,839
in in that way the human brain and

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,760
utilizing your own experience

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,839
is is you know far gonna be far greater

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,560
than a.i at its present state

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,920
maybe in many many years time there

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,520
might be something that

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,040
comes close but you know i don't think

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,440
it's ever going to replace

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,359
you know the need for people to

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,440
physically test something

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,960
um there will be that there's going to

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,119
be more and more automation

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,040
okay and i think that that will drive

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,480
and be at the center of the success of a

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,480
lot of organizations

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:13,200
but on the other hand manual testing

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,119
is is not going to die um remember

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,240
automation is only as good as what

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,800
you're telling it to do

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,160
anyway um so you know you've got to

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,599
think about those things you've got to

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,960
assess the risk you've got to understand

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,880
what you need to automate

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,240
and that's where ao may come in in terms

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,680
of helping to

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,480
you know what should i automate based on

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,480
this that and the other but for me the

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,520
biggest the real big benefit of

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,880
automation and i've had this

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,079
conversation with so many of our

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,480
engineers

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,000
is actually it frees you up to do more

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,560
and more exploratory testing

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
and exploratory testing is a manual

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,280
process that you know

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,200
is is so valuable because you're you

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,280
which you've got time to do it

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,359
really helps you understand your product

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,680
and explore your product and and you

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,640
know

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,720
think about how if you've if you've

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,720
taken time to understand your customers

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,240
then you'll it's a great way of really

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,319
understanding the products and

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,680
as to whether it will meet their needs

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,280
um

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,920
more and i think there's going to be a

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,400
lot more self-serve technology so i mean

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,119
you know um obviously the you know the

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,920
serverless

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,280
side of things and is very much helps

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,400
organizations basically just

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,319
go well we'll you know scales itself and

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,760
you know we'll use what we need and we

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,880
won't when we won't and yeah that's very

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,640
much self-serve but

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,920
again we got the things we've like we're

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,119
seeing around

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,599
you know um amazon you know releasing

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,800
their their new store concepts of i come

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,480
in what they're called now but

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,480
you know going in there serving yourself

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,119
coming out not having to really speak to

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,800
anybody

00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,160
i mean sometimes that's great but i

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,520
think you know

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,960
it's nice to especially being in

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,560
lockdown for so long it's very nice to

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,000
actually speak to some people face to

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,599
face on occasions

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,680
um so i think you know from my

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,480
perspective technology

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,160
is gonna is going gonna shift obviously

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,920
we saw how quickly

00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,760
or we've seen how quickly technology has

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,240
kind of shaped over

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,280
you know the timelines of events now i

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,480
went from

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,640
a 13 years in one organization where

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,359
technology didn't really evolve

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,440
massively but then that product probably

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,760
more so around our customer base

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,800
um and what our customer needs and and

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,960
what was happening

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,560
in that side of the industry we went to

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,160
easyjet and things were moving they

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,359
moved more rapidly we were looking at

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,680
more technologies

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,960
you know the the mobile boarding pass

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,680
the app you know all those kind of

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,599
things

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,119
um and actually that was quite a short

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,720
space of time in which we delivered a

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,200
lot of those things

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,160
and then fast forward to now yeah we

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,079
we're

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,400
using a whole host of technologies to

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,839
basically help us along our ways it

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,800
makes engineer technology makes

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,119
engineering

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,160
quicker easier you know more

00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,640
self-sufficient

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,280
you know those kind of things as well

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,720
what about

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,920
ways of working so ways of working

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,400
um as i mentioned earlier i think

00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,760
in the future everyone will test but not

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,480
necessarily everyone will be a

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,200
specialist

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,560
okay i think within you know within our

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,119
industry

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,920
we really need to kind of take a step

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,200
back and sometimes remove ourselves from

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,319
you know um the common thing around but

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,119
not everybody can

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,960
test right you need to be a specialist

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,520
to do this you need to

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,520
to there there is some truth in that but

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,359
i think in today's society

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,119
in terms of how teams work in terms of

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,000
the agile practices

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,000
you know the collaboration knew that

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,440
that kind of way of working

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,280
i think we need to open ourselves up to

00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,599
say yes we should be

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,440
encouraging everyone to test because

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,240
everyone is responsible for the quality

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,560
of the product we're

00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,800
putting out you can't you can't say

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,400
people need to own the quality

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,240
if they're not if we're then going to

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,040
say well you can't you can't do this bit

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,319
because

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,800
you know that's our job um and you know

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,680
i think

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,960
you know our engineers are very very

00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,599
good at that now

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,280
and actually our qas are starting to

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,280
pick up engineering

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,400
type tasks as well because they're you

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,079
know they're pairing a lot more

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,599
understanding the code a lot more

00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,359
and so on and so on so we're really

00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,839
trying to i don't know

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,839
we're trying to blur the lines between

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,280
the engineering and the quality

00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,200
space it's never good there's always

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,599
going to be a you know the two things

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,720
but

00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,800
it's really trying to bring them more

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,240
together we've got other teams away who

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,079
are less mature and not

00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,599
you know just starting on that journey

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,200
where we still got a lot of manual

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,280
testing happening

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,480
and it's very much done you know dev

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,560
test kind of

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,319
approach so you know we've got a lot to

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,119
go through and still and still learn so

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,480
you know it's going to be really

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,599
interesting to see how that show hopes

00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,520
up

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,720
speed and agility will become even more

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,240
important so

00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,839
that means you know shifting left more

00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,400
but also shifting right and really

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,880
understanding our customers now

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,079
if we want to if we want to deliver

00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,079
quickly

00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,440
we need to understand what we need to

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,040
deliver and a great way to understand

00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,200
what we need to deliver is to understand

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,640
our customer right so if we can

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,280
understand our customer

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,440
then that helps when we're talking down

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,480
this this side of the process

00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,960
um and when i say shift more left

00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,599
you know it's not just about cicd it's

00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,400
about

00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,000
everything we do before we push code or

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,240
we we put a pr in

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,079
uh and merge that code in right so the

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,880
conversations we have how we clarify our

00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,880
tickets what

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,079
you know what testing do we do before we

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,720
we do you know we

00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,160
um we put those pr's in you know what

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,319
demos are we doing and what

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,599
what um code reviews are we doing with

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:35,040
our engineers

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,839
and our um and you know our

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,559
our qas you know how they how are they

00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,720
working uh

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,480
quality will be front and center so and

00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,400
i say this because

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,160
customers just they're going to be less

00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,200
patient because they've got so many

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,720
options

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,040
right i mean you look at banking you

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,319
know how monzo come along and change the

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,680
shape of banking and

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,440
you know you've just got options out

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,480
there now that you can just switch to

00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:02,319
different um providers or you know

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:05,200
um sales teams or whatever

00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,800
really really quickly and you know so

00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,839
we've really got to be thinking more

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,480
around

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:12,240
quality but as you know then we've got

00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,520
point two which is speed and agility so

00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,160
how do we deliver

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,040
quality at speed you know so these are

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,720
the things we need to think about more

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,720
cross-functional teams with t-shaped

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,079
members uh will will just naturally need

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,920
to increase i think uh

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,079
you know we need to kind of broaden get

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,240
a much bigger breadth of knowledge

00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,160
uh around these things so understand

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,280
technology more or have more empathy for

00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,119
engineering

00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,800
you know but don't lose sight of you

00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,040
know where your specialism is

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,720
and if your specialism is very much in

00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,319
the testing space

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,280
you you um go deeper into certain

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,440
certain types in

00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,800
that area as well to think about more

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,960
around you know

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,119
the breadth of the testing spectrum so

00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,280
you think about performance security

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,200
you know accessibility all these things

00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,359
that maybe you've never done before

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,839
will start playing more and more into

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,480
into the you know into the into the

00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:06,240
space

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,359
um and then i think uh as we kind of

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,599
build more and more self managing teams

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:13,680
the role of test leads and managers will

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,680
naturally just need to evolve

00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,119
or the the risk is that it will just it

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,760
will fade away

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,200
um and i think you know what the reason

00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,760
i say that is because

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,240
what we're trying to do uh at dunell for

00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,240
example

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,040
is very much lead from within the team

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,000
so you know put the autonomy to the team

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,720
um yes we have strategy yes we have you

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,240
know a

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:39,119
a a continuous improvements roadmap for

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,720
for our chapter and things like that but

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,680
how they go about delivering that how

00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,119
they go about

00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,960
assessing whether they're successful or

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,160
not is really it's for the team to

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,920
determine

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,119
so it's those kind of things where you

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,559
need to start really thinking about

00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,839
around ways of working

00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,559
but i think there's one thing that we

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,160
can all guarantee um and that's that

00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,960
guess what we'll still have post-its

00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,839
because

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,839
post-its never die it's an amazing it's

00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:05,599
an amazing thing

00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:09,200
um so how can we prepare

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:11,280
so firstly

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,280
we need to have a growth mindset okay so

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,359
we need to be thinking

00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,359
no um look at these challenges or

00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:20,319
opportunities you know really kind of

00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,720
step into this really self-learn you

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,400
know

00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,839
um don't be scared of failure

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
acknowledge and embrace where you feel

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,599
as though

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,119
you need to learn and you know don't

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:31,440
don't shy away from it um

00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,480
just just utilize failure as an

00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,800
opportunity to

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,520
to to grow your your your learnings and

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,160
grow your

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,480
your experience um and you know i think

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,800
i think we also need to think about

00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,800
you know looking at um rather than

00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,160
necessarily saying oh you know

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,520
developers are ex maybe start having a

00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,559
bit of empathy for them and really

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,000
thinking about you know

00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:56,720
understanding their trade and vice versa

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,720
enabling them to understand our trade

00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:02,000
and not just engineers you know our pos

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,000
our our scrum masters our base you know

00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,880
our customers

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,079
um but we really need to grow you know

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,359
have that growth mindset

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:13,520
to really evolve and continue to develop

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,040
um we can't be stuck in our old ways we

00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,440
can't be talking about

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,480
how many defects have we raised how many

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,160
you know assessing quality on on defects

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,240
i'll give you an example right i don't

00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,800
encourage defects to be raised

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,280
in a sprint i i try and encourage the

00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,839
guys

00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,119
don't raise a defect have a chat about

00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,319
it and get it fixed

00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,480
because actually if you've done your

00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,920
upfront um collaboration

00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,359
everything should be detailed in your

00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,720
story and if you're telling me that

00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,599
something's not working based on the

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,319
story

00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,960
that's your your your conversation right

00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,880
there

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,160
um rather than going away and raising a

00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,000
defect and you know

00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,520
taking the time to do that and going

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,079
through that whole cycle some teams have

00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,920
adopted

00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,680
it others haven't we've done away with

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,760
bug boards and things like that

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,800
um but you know it's those kind of just

00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,880
in initiative

00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,800
kind of ways of thinking that may just

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,800
make the difference in your teams

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,280
and it won't work for everybody trust me

00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,599
but just try it just think differently

00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,880
think outside the box

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,720
and then don't don't fade away

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,400
okay so there's a lot of people that are

00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,920
very much concerned around

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,800
you know do i need to learn automation

00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,640
do i need to

00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,240
yes yeah in my opinion yes but

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,480
think of it bit more logically right

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:30,079
become the flux capacitor

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,200
of quality okay so you remember back in

00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,960
back to the future where

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,040
flux capacitor makes time travel

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,280
possible everything centers around it

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,240
you become that person within the

00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,400
industry right

00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,520
within your team so think about being a

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,880
quality advocate

00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:48,079
focus on quality engineering okay so

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,680
understand engineering practices um

00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,160
don't just don't just worry about

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,520
automation automation is part of that

00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,119
but if you don't really understand

00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,160
engineering practices it's very

00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,839
difficult to

00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,040
engage and and have empathy for your

00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:02,640
engineers widen your breadth

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,800
you know your breadth of testing and

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,680
technology tech we've seen

00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,640
it moves at a fast pace anybody working

00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,800
in tech

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,640
can't assume that their role between

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,559
within a five-year period

00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,640
is not going to have to evolve or how

00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,359
they think because tech changes so

00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,079
quickly

00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:22,400
so you know don't think that you're

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,359
doing a role now that in five years time

00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,680
is going to be safe because of x no just

00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,400
just

00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,000
always think about evolution um

00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,119
collaboration so think about how you

00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,480
build quality and so

00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:36,559
being that advocate build quality and um

00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,520
coaching so i mentioned before around

00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,240
you know test leads

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,319
and managers this is so important i

00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,240
can't recommend highly enough

00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:49,440
um you know becoming a qualified coach

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,480
having a coach and being a coach it's so

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,079
rewarding

00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,400
uh on both ends but also so so valuable

00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,079
because coaching quality into an

00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,880
organization is really where test

00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,359
managers

00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,480
and test leads you know i i see them

00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,880
kind of becoming

00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,160
you know those kind of roles uh i've

00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,800
mentioned the engineering thing

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,599
cloud technology for obvious reasons

00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,119
just just

00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,839
get your head into it get an

00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:16,400
understanding of it there's plenty of um

00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:18,240
courses out there to do that keep up to

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,319
date with tech and ways of working

00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,319
there's no reason nobody should be able

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,240
to do this these days i mean

00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:26,400
great meetups like like this one you

00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,079
know there's so many out there

00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,079
that you can just jump on in a lunch

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,559
time and learn i mean

00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,079
i wish i had that back in 1997 when i

00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,599
didn't have a clue about what i called

00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,119
this spell testing let alone nobody

00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,319
really what was

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:42,640
um and just always focus on their

00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:44,880
innovation and how you can evolve don't

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,480
be scared to change don't be scared to

00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:50,880
innovate and try something different

00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,079
and finally i just want to say how

00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,119
personally why i think

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,160
we are so privileged um to work in these

00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,079
roles

00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,359
it's very rare you'll have a role where

00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,880
you're you need to

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,559
your breadth of knowledge needs to be so

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,000
great that actually

00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,599
it could take you in so many different

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,359
directions right so

00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,960
here we've got a flux capacitor as i

00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:11,599
mentioned that's that's you guys

00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,880
there in your teams you're learning so

00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,240
much about coaching you're learning

00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,599
about performance engineering you're

00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,520
learning about engineering

00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,640
devops scrum mastering business

00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,960
analytics because you

00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,920
you liaise with them day in day out

00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,680
you're

00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,359
you're there to kind of help them as

00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,559
much as they are to help you

00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,480
but also what you're gaining is you're

00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,359
getting a raft of knowledge a raft of

00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,079
experience

00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,880
that you can basically take anywhere you

00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,480
know

00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,760
it's it's a really we are really

00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,400
privileged and we should think about

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,880
that

00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,160
you know i've done you know a lot of um

00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,119
i've recently i've done a lot of

00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,280
coaching

00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,720
and i love it it's great but i'm still

00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,920
coaching in the quality space it doesn't

00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,200
need to be different

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,880
you don't need to go and be you know

00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,920
just coach agile you can coach so many

00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,559
different things

00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,839
so you know we are really privileged and

00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,599
you know i just don't want people to

00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,880
forget that and be concerned about some

00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,720
of the things i've said

00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,559
you know there's opportunities out there

00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,359
for for if you just want to go out and

00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,119
grasp them

00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:05,200
and you know even within the quality

00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,230
space itself

00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,400
so that's me hopefully it has

00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,799
[Music]

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,480
been good i don't know but i'll open it

00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,319
up to questions

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,839
thank you very much stuart um okay we've

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,280
got quite a selection of questions i'll

00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:20,079
get through as many as possible just

00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,700
burn one more i scroll up for the chat

00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,960
um

00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,960
[Music]

00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:33,520
okay

00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,040
so from steve davis do you think there's

00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,000
a case to say customers are becoming

00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,160
more

00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,359
quality based on the delivery method of

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,520
smartphones

00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,280
and apps initial delivery followed by

00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,240
regular updates to resolve bugs and add

00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,920
features

00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,680
by stuff it seems consumers are becoming

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,000
attuned to buying into like our delivery

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,200
and

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,440
consumerism um

00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,319
so i missed the first bit of that um and

00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,079
can you just repeat

00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,520
yeah sure do you think there's a case to

00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,520
say customers are becoming more patient

00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,720
with quality

00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:05,040
um i think i think they're they're

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,200
understanding technology more

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,720
um i mean if if you were to speak to my

00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,359
father-in-law he's the most impatient

00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,640
person

00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,839
you know his wife i wasn't working the

00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,720
other day and he wanted me to fix the

00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:15,119
world but

00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,000
you know it's it really is kind of it's

00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,480
going to be the

00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,400
the what is your customer market you

00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,480
know so for us at dunelm

00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,240
our primary customer is is kind of

00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,880
middle age and above

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,359
now those people may not be as accepting

00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,559
of

00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,760
you know technology and and you know the

00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:33,599
i've got to wait for an update but

00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,440
that's cool so it's really going to be

00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,000
driven by your your customer

00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,280
in the market you're in so you know i

00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,720
think that that's something we always

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,240
going to need to consider but yeah i

00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,520
think definitely you know

00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:48,160
customers will understand um

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,720
you know technology more as we kind of

00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,720
progress

00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,280
but i don't think we can just assume

00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,880
that they're going to be more

00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,799
graham patient you stuart um next

00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,040
question from chris henderson

00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:01,040
what are the main challenges faced when

00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,119
trying to adopt a culture of quality

00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,920
object left what can be done to help

00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:09,200
this transition easier

00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,160
um so i think the biggest so the biggest

00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,640
challenges for me

00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,960
are it is and it's going to be a bit

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,839
sound a bit cliche but it is the mindset

00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,200
and and one of the things that we've

00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:23,200
worked really hard on

00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:25,520
is bringing in people with that mindset

00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,119
so there is a there is a there is a

00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,400
phrase if you can't change the people

00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,440
change the people

00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,480
and sometimes it is is as hard as that

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,280
you know if you haven't got the right

00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,880
mindset if you

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,880
if your organization is going on a

00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,640
some people aren't going to be right for

00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,520
that transformation it's a horrible

00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,760
thing to say

00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,280
but that's where the coaching side of it

00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,240
comes in really really you know

00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,920
massively and

00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,200
i think you what you need to be able to

00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,440
do is is um

00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,400
look at quality and how you measure

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,559
quality

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,480
and how you then um you know talk about

00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,839
that in within your organization

00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,200
and you know there's there's a great

00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,160
books i know a lot of people have

00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,200
probably read it

00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:08,000
called lead um this this book here

00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,240
around you know leading quality it just

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,839
gives so many great examples where

00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,599
the conversations you have are really

00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,280
important on a day-to-day basis

00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,960
you know the values what we've done as a

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,359
chapter is we've we've

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,200
created or we're creating values and

00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,760
principles that we want to talk about

00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,680
and

00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,200
champion on a day-to-day basis so you

00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,559
know it's not just say me

00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,920
in the head of role trying to have these

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,640
conversations but we're doing it in the

00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,799
teams

00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,960
we're doing it at every level possible

00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:34,720
and it it can be a real slow

00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,640
slow process but it is it's really

00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,119
trying to you know shift those mindsets

00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,200
of

00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,319
you know um quality is everybody's

00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,240
responsibility

00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,760
and you know and understanding the

00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,559
impact of what we have on our customers

00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,640
if it's not

00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,680
good enough and it's also understanding

00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,640
what what

00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,880
is what is good enough as well um and

00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,920
and

00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,000
you know again it comes back to

00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,000
understanding the customers

00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,280
great thank you sir next question from

00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,599
james mckay

00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,960
how have you got on with influencing and

00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,119
training developers

01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,040
that quality really needs embracing by

01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:08,079
this group to have any hopes of

01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,880
delivering a quality product

01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,640
yeah this is this is always a a

01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,160
difficult one i think

01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:20,160
it's the biggest challenge is i think

01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:21,280
when um if you don't if you're lucky

01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,040
enough that you've got

01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:28,400
at least one engineer in your team

01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:30,400
that understands or wants to do this

01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,680
that's a real win if you've got one

01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,240
engineer that will

01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,680
kind of champion it and start and start

01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,599
you know encouraging others or

01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:39,119
at least showcasing and leading by

01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,559
example that's a massive win

01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,240
we're going through this a little bit at

01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,720
the moment with some of our teams some

01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,720
are just

01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,760
some of our engineers are just just like

01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,119
all over this they

01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,640
i don't even need to talk to them

01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,280
because it's just ingrained in how they

01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,720
think

01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,480
whereas there's other teams where we

01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,119
just gotta nurture them a little bit

01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,480
more

01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,359
um and you know kind of not force them

01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,640
into anything

01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:02,400
but just kind of um talk to them about

01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,160
you know the benefits of doing certain

01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,960
things at certain times

01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,200
um and you know a lot of a lot of this

01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,200
is

01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,319
is really about just collaborating

01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,119
better as well

01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:14,400
so you know and and and again again

01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,240
having empathy

01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,680
for your engineers if you can build

01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,319
empathy for your engineers and actually

01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,839
understand

01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:22,960
engineering and the challenges those

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:24,960
guys go through that can really help

01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,160
so i mentioned earlier about i've had a

01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,960
lot of conversations with some of our

01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,119
engineers

01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,799
all over the the engineering side of it

01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,440
and the automation they love it

01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:35,280
you know um but they're asking me now

01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,920
stu now we've got all this automation

01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,119
can we stop doing exploratory testing so

01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,920
i'm like

01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,079
no you can't you know the idea is you

01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,599
can do more of it it's amazing right

01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,440
biggest benefit of automation

01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,720
exploratory so and it's trying to

01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,079
educate them in those kind of things as

01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,520
well and you know one of the tech leads

01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,799
came up to me instead

01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,480
i don't really understand what

01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,280
exploratory testing is you know can you

01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,359
kind of

01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,119
and we what we've done is we've created

01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:00,160
guilds um so we've got quality

01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,920
engineering guild

01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,599
where we talk about this stuff a lot and

01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,760
have sessions around it

01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,440
um and that's open to the organization

01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,200
that's open to to the world

01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,559
um and we can try and keep you know keep

01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,119
that um

01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,760
constant discussion and education going

01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,119
um

01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,559
there's always going to be challenging

01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,039
challenges with this but it's just kind

01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,880
of

01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:22,480
getting those champions and from within

01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,400
okay i'm just going to squeeze this last

01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,400
question into you because this um

01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,240
prompted quite a big discussion in chat

01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,960
um around the notebooks

01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,599
so um the basic the group says do you

01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,319
believe in

01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:36,079
no bugs or is there a case for some bugs

01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:38,400
for what wasn't seen

01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,160
considered foreseeable and wasn't in

01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,200
scope for the current sprint ie is our

01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,240
case for

01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,720
underscore sunbugs underscore

01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,160
um so let's face it right there's always

01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,079
going to be bugs um

01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,799
in terms of what my kind of approach to

01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:55,599
this is i don't i don't

01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:56,799
believe a bug is a bug until it's in

01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,960
production

01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:00,480
now up until that point is just work in

01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,160
progress now how you

01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,680
how you differentiate and how you manage

01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,680
that is really kind of

01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,039
you know down to the team if if it's

01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,520
something that wasn't thought about

01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,920
within the scope of a story then for me

01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,000
that isn't a bug that's you know that's

01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,960
that's feature related and therefore

01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,799
that's either comes in as a late change

01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,559
to your story which is never great

01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,079
or it's another story uh you know

01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,319
because that is feature development if

01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,240
it's if it's a change in um

01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:27,599
in the actual functionality or the

01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,960
feature you're delivering so

01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:33,359
you know again yeah i

01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,359
in terms of in within a sprint obviously

01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:38,559
you know looking at and and how you

01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:41,599
measure you know um the success of a

01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,240
a piece of code or a feature or a

01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,640
product

01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,280
you know it's it's based on whether it's

01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,200
meeting

01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,280
the the criteria that's your scenarios

01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,280
or you know your acceptance

01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,760
and you know for me having a

01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,920
conversation is far more powerful than

01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,200
raising a ticket in jira and then just

01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,319
handing it off to somebody

01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:03,039
to get them to fix and it also gives you

01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:04,160
the opportunity to really determine are

01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,480
your stories

01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,520
up front had enough investment

01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,960
understood

01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,960
and you know um

01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:17,839
worth are ready to to be delivered

01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,440
um so so it's it's a controversial

01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,960
thing right it's not all teams like it

01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,880
whenever i've raised it before

01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,400
you know people have been like whoa hold

01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,200
on a minute um

01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,480
but it is it's something to try um but

01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,160
again you have to be a bit you have to

01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,559
be a bit mindful of it and mature around

01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,559
it

01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:35,359
and give the ownership to the teams to

01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,960
really manage it

01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:38,480

01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,839
