Title: Where Did I Put My Trust? | Lunchtime Sessions | QA Babble - June 2020
Publication date: 2020-06-24
Playlist: QA Babble
Description: 
	This Lunchtime Session is organised by Woodrow Mercer and presented on YouTube by Pusher

"Where did I put my trust?", with Martin Huckle

Overview:
“Where did I put my trust?” is an exploration of some of the areas in a software development project, with a stronger focus on testing, where we place our trust or withhold it. There will be a look at where acceptance of the current situation holds us back and how empowerment of your team can be a way to challenge accepted norms and increase trust.

Speaker bio:

Martin is an Automation Test Lead, mostly, currently working for BJSS as that combined with a development team lead role.
He has tried his hand at development and business analysis, now using both to his advantage to support improvements and innovation in automation in test. Very interested in supporting others in learning and personal growth. And in his spare time he does clowning amongst other things.

trust so we can talk about trust today

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,990
it's been kind of an interesting thing

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,030
for me to see looking back over my

00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:15,299
career where trust is played a part in

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,310
it where it is today and how I've been

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,699
able to challenge it or or improve it

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,449
there's a good lot so that's really what

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,060
this talks about so the kind of things

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,800
that we'll look at are kind of who can I

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,759
get my work to and who do I get my work

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,100
to what what information could I publish

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,410
it's kind of another thing we're not

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,059
going to cover that much here the kind

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,870
of tools that we might pick why do we

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,090
pick them but also who is interesting to

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,219
think about trust now because a lot was

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,289
working from home or having been working

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,870
from home there's been a lot of trust

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,699
that we will get on with what we do and

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,610
maybe that versa conversation that we

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,500
teamed in hours around trust so it's a

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:04,589
first of all would be the kind of the

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,900
standard beginning what is trust so it's

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,729
a firm belief in the reality liability

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,880
truth probability of someone or

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,159
something so Trust isn't a definite

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,189
thing it's what we believe it's a belief

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,369
system almost and we're more likely to

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:23,220
believe certain things than other things

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:26,130
so where where might we find that

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,590
trustees missing quite off this between

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,470
different groups so if you think about

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,619
how things were if you're old enough at

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,729
least back in the days of waterfall they

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,210
were different there was a definite

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,700
split between developers and testers the

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,680
developers kind of ended up throwing

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,049
their their code over potentially to

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,020
protest this intestines then did their

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,640
thing passed it back again and so that

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,470
actually this this isn't working and

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,030
that there was contention there because

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,060
those groups were seeing this as quite

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,299
distinct thankfully now with with the

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,920
advent of agile we see a lot more

00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:04,649
collaboration and a lot more overlap in

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,860
the skills between those those two

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,300
groups as we might define them and again

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,039
if you just look out in the outside

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,970
world you can see this happening as well

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,700
out in political arenas in

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,130
in other areas where different groups

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,890
have got different ideas about about

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,020
things and so they have some some kind

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,260
of contention going on and there isn't

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,180
so much trust there and other area is

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,520
maybe what we've been let down before

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,800
and that can be a tool that's let us

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,500
down it can be a person or group of

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,950
people where something's being promised

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,320
and is not being delivered interestingly

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,330
some the TED talks I watched to kind of

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,740
look at this and find out a bit more

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,130
about trust I've said that different

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,870
cultures found you trust in different

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,470
ways so for instance apparently the

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,020
Americans have more trusting people that

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,970
deliver things at all costs so that's

00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,210
one way to look at it as well as it can

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:04,030
be a cultural thing and sometimes when

00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,250
something new comes along we may trust

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,260
it because we've seen something like

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:13,210
that before or it may be completely new

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,710
and we're quite distrustful of it in

00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,860
which case we there may be some

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,650
automatic trust trust in this cases is

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,870
where maybe someone from our group that

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,130
we respect is saying actually try this

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,760
thing it's really cool

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,709
or it might be that it's someone from

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,330
another group that you don't trust as

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,280
much and so you don't have too much

00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,730
trust in that thing that they're

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,640
suggesting so someone in our group but

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:43,300
outside of our group as well there's the

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,550
idea of authority so possibly more so

00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,560
again if you're my kind of age where

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,690
you've grown up and and you you were

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,730
kind of it was drummed into you to

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,000
respect your teachers to respect your

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,650
the policemen etc you might have a thing

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,080
with Authority and I'll cover that a

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,580
little bit later and so that might mean

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,760
that you trust someone that you see is

00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:07,239
in authority regardless of whether they

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,040
deserve that trust will not in groups

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,380
you have common goals and beliefs and

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,480
those beliefs can build up the trust

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,810
within your group and building those

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,060
common goals helps that as well it may

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,160
be a familiar Brandel tool so something

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,360
like selenium we don't always question

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,300
that we just go okay then

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,530
selenium everyone uses ditching UI

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,300
automation let's give

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,690
we don't we don't necessarily question

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,160
that it's the white or not so over to

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,860
acceptance so I've included its

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,010
acceptance here because sometimes we

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,500
just accept that the trust is there so

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,120
accept as being the action of consenting

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,140
to receive or undertake something

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,760
offered so we want to accept trust it

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,590
helps us growing it it helps us work

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,920
within a particular area and in a

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:57,670
particular team but sometimes it's quite

00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,850
passive and we'll accept things as

00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,470
unchangeable so one of the key examples

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,070
of this which I'm going to cover later

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,930
is flaky tests in UI automation there

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,870
seems to be a general consensus that

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,790
when whenever you do UI automation

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,600
you're going to get flaky tests maybe

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:20,440
we're too accepting of that but we have

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,200
a distrust of UI automation and in my

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:27,580
experience you can you can work of that

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,040
you can improve your UI tests and so the

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,010
flaky tests are just the tiny part of

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,550
what what happens um rather than it

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:39,450
being something you accept common models

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,830
the problem we have live models is that

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,600
while they're useful to try and

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,450
understand the world when sometimes take

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,510
them as the truth and so we'll take that

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:53,290
model and we try and fit things into

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:56,740
that model you know it's the kind of

00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,970
thing where you have something that this

00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,800
is the way I'm going to view the world

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,700
and you try and squish everything in

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,070
there to make that view correct

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:10,800
and then just just tradition we accept

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:13,540
things as true we have had like I say

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,120
olden times you know developers and

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,160
testers is very separate and we still

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,410
see those two roles as separate and yet

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,260
there's there's a lot of overlap between

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,290
the skills needed and there can be a lot

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,919
of cross fertilization and improvements

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:33,850
made through the collaboration between

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:36,430
different skill sets and then as it as I

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,590
said we tend to accept people are their

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,580
roles whereas really everybody's an

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,610
individual and especially as a lead

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,349
we should see thicknesses individual

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,870
identify what their skills are and help

00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:50,060
them grow and in doing that we're

00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,289
putting our trust in them and they're

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,500
hopefully going to trust us because

00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:57,590
we're helping them grow as individuals

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,509
um this this is another aspect so I've

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,750
experienced this in quite a few teams

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,759
where people are not necessarily afraid

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,770
but don't feel it's their place to speak

00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,539
up and say actually I don't like the way

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,379
things are or I think you can improve

00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:13,789
something and so we have to ask other

00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:16,219
people that you work with empowered to

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:19,400
raise issues normally that comes through

00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:23,270
a formal kind of process like a retro

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,599
maybe but also if we want people to kind

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,729
of raise issues as they go along even if

00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,740
it's with a particular person and they

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:33,560
need it they need to trust you to come

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,509
to you to say this person's done this

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,219
thing I'm not happy with that what can

00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:40,009
we do and they need to trust you enough

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:44,150
to come to you to be able to to resolve

00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:47,389
the issue our people in power to suggest

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,039
change so again I might be sitting there

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,810
going right we're gonna use selenium and

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,699
somebody's got some experience that I'm

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,550
not aware of which says that actually we

00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,979
should be using a different tool and so

00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,750
do they do they feel like they can speak

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,789
up so these are all the kind of things

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,680
where we want to build trust and people

00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:07,550
think need to feel trusted enough to be

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,560
able to speak up and also how do we

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,000
empower people to make that change so if

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,810
somebody says I think we ought to do

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,770
this we agree it's a good idea can we

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,569
let them run with it

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,419
but do they feel ready to run with it

00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:22,610
what kind of support do we can we put

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:24,560
around them to let them do that so that

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,449
that's that's the kind of a bit of

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,349
discussion around trust and acceptance

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:32,659
and and how I see them so we're now onto

00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:35,570
my journey of trust so it's all about me

00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,760
for the minute first of all I started

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,459
off in a space of I just do what I'm

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,760
told and again this comes straight out

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:45,529
of school I had a thing with all the

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,920
authorities told me to do this I must do

00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:52,610
this I was quite unquestioning and just

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,850
delivered what they said or even if I

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,690
thought there was something

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,459
about it I wouldn't question it then I

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,889
kind of go into into a space in a

00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,440
company where I felt like I was

00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:06,240
delivering a lot but there was a group

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,709
of people who got the acknowledgment

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,290
they got all the kind of more sexy

00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:12,779
things to do and and my trust in the

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:16,350
management at that point waned

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:19,110
I felt demotivated and so I can kind of

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:22,319
see that if if I'm not acknowledging

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,480
everyone in my team and helping them to

00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:27,329
grow etc then I can see they'll be the

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,639
motivators and I delivery or potentially

00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:32,310
drop and satisfaction of the whole team

00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,579
can drop as well because because of

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,319
relationships and the kind of comments

00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,639
they might money if they're not feeling

00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:43,800
valued and then another interesting

00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,600
space where there was trust and kind of

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,420
neck next on my journey was was around

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,540
offshore development so I was running a

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,949
test team some offshore developers were

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,980
were introduced they were onshore

00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:59,550
initially I joined the team when they'd

00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:03,240
thought this this is as if this is back

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:05,189
in early early 2000s and they'd use

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,050
quick test professional to automate our

00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:09,779
regression suite and the way they've

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,540
done it is they'd taken our 70 70 odd

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,100
scripts and they created two automation

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,730
scripts which both took an hour and a

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,339
half to run and at that point I didn't

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,110
really know much about automation but I

00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,199
kind of had a gut feeling that that

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,439
wasn't the right thing to do so I went

00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:30,209
off and researched and came back to them

00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:32,220
and gave them advice on on that one I

00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:36,389
said we need to split this up this needs

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:38,699
to be easier to debug et cetera and so I

00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,350
I then didn't have as much trust in them

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:42,810
just because of the way they had done

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,000
that and they they were they were kind

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:48,110
of given to me as experts in the field

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,529
and that should be delivering something

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,089
that that was good for the company and

00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:56,250
and the right thing to do but they

00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:59,069
hadn't so my trust was a little bit like

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,470
that but we did build on that and we

00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:04,290
came up with with a working solution in

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,630
the end unfortunately not long after we

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,830
did that the company I was working for

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,740
decided to switch off

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,160
sure partners and so I was in a new

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,960
situation with another set of offshore

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,520
automation developers on what what they

00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,830
did was they said oh we've got a

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,200
proprietary system you can't look at it

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,550
you can't see our scripts but we can

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,510
give you this spreadsheet with key

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:29,670
wording and so I I ended up in a

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,200
position where I couldn't really tell

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,330
what the tests were doing and so I

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,500
couldn't sign them off as doing why I

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,610
felt they should be doing and

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,680
unfortunately my management wouldn't

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,780
support me in saying you need to show us

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,920
more because we can't sign off these

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:48,690
tests so in the end there was just a a

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,160
passive trust that the right tests were

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,690
being written and doing the right thing

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,910
which isn't a good place to be in really

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:59,070
so I didn't have a great experience with

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:02,070
it with offshore teams or at least the

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:07,140
separation from the test that I wanted

00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:08,910
to understand as a test lead I had to

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,700
let things go and part of that letting

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:15,540
go was was understanding delegation and

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,910
so my first one when I got into a

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,130
position where I was leading three

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,560
different teams and I couldn't be as

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,450
hands-on as I was I needed to work in in

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,950
the area of delegation and I just

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,900
started giving people things to do that

00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,120
I didn't really want to do and that was

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,130
kinda the the initial way I delegated I

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,720
just kinda went I'm a bit overwhelmed I

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,340
need to get rid of this or I can do that

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,310
I didn't really think about necessarily

00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,650
who I was giving it to or whether they

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,900
were skilled or empowered enough to do

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,090
it which which then move me in to come

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:48,750
to the understanding of more about

00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:51,030
empowerment and so giving a task to

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,920
someone that isn't solution eyes so that

00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,930
they can use their creative skills to

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,560
come up with a good solution I can give

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:01,020
direction or I'll also make sure that if

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,270
I need a mentor is there any training we

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:07,530
can put that in place and understanding

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:09,240
that for them for me to trust them to do

00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,250
this thing I also need to give some

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,050
support around that and so it's a lot

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,210
that's where I'm at at the moment is

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,520
knowing that I need to understand my

00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,710
team knowing that if I give them some

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,270
work to do I need to empower them to do

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,010
that and and give them

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,450
the space and the trust in me that they

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,780
can come back and say this isn't working

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:30,150
or I need to do something differently

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:34,140
and so that that's my kind of journey of

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:37,530
trust in software development so we're

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:40,500
now gonna focus in on trusting in UI

00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,720
automation so this this has been

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,520
interesting to me because when when I

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,980
came on to my current project erm

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:51,480
probably about five years ago where the

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,550
system that was very flaky it had been

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,600
built and anything built to a certain

00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:00,540
extent on by well-meaning amateurs if

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,990
you like it was we didn't have the

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:08,160
technical skills when we built it for it

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:11,400
for it to be scalable or easy to use

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,770
necessarily but it also had a lot of

00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,360
different team leads through with

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,010
different ideas and a lot of different

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,170
automation engineers trying different

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:22,020
things out so it was also a bit of a

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:25,110
mishmash and I I had to take the

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:28,620
decision that we're gonna do something

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,750
new and so my journey now has been the

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,780
last kind of 40 years Raley's is

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,970
building up and understanding this a new

00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,670
framework further for our automation

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,710
tests and a lot of that we've now got to

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,120
a position really where our UI

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:47,850
automation is as reliable as the

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:52,530
integration test we potentially see I've

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:56,580
seen in the last six months more power

00:14:52,530 --> 00:15:01,020
on we've seen more more failures in the

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:03,030
last six months from the integration

00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,850
test than than we have from the UI test

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:08,570
and part of that is because we can we've

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,220
been out to see that the way the

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,530
integration tests are written make maybe

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,180
this this is a place that we need to get

00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,960
the testers more involved in the reviews

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,770
because we're having things like

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,860
hard-coded dates that are causing

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:26,250
problems on we're having to catch up

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,440
with the integration test quality now

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,590
that the automation framework is pretty

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,420
steady away and I can say that because

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,540
we've and that this will frighten some

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,050
people but we've got

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:41,920
but really nearly 3,000 UI automation

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:44,530
tests and they run in parallel so we

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,680
have parallel builds and we use test ng

00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,330
to run a threads at once and we still

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,670
don't get very many intermittent

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:56,320
failures as we call them we get maybe

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:59,980
one or two a week but those no we

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,780
investigate those and fix those so as

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:05,860
far as I'm concerned we've got a pretty

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:09,580
solid system there part of that is

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,500
because we focused on code quality my

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,210
view and having picked this up from

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,640
someone else is is really that you

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,680
wouldn't want to measure you wouldn't

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,120
want a poor quality measure for

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,150
something that you want as high quality

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,940
and so your your automation framework

00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,560
needs to be high quality code so that

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,390
what what you're doing is you're

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,030
measuring something with an accurate

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,580
measure it also needs the flexibility in

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:36,820
the maintainability so I'm being able to

00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:39,520
trust my ester as you might call him and

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,400
I I just said in the past I've just said

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,500
okay then we can a lot more tests

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,480
written now what we need now like this

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:52,650
is a way to expand and to be able to

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,780
keep the time of the builds below but

00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,190
continued throughout tests and so he

00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,340
went away and worked our way of

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:04,390
splitting up the test Suites dynamically

00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:06,280
as it builds on Jenkins and we looked at

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,310
how many different threats we could have

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,680
to run the test so is now until somebody

00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:16,440
cuts off our AWS purse-strings

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,610
we've got a way of expanding UI tests

00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,209
infinitely if we wanted to I don't

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:25,050
really want to but we could do so the

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:29,500
kind of thing that causes flaky tests

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:32,770
dates ages and time passing so as I said

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,500
you want to avoid hard-coded dates if

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,020
you're going to have people

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,210
records in there you need to make sure

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,940
that you understand if this say a date

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,550
of birth and you've got some tests that

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,380
check an age then you don't want to have

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,120
to maintain those every year that that

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,059
person gets

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,220
you're older you want to be had to

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:56,130
dynamically generate the people whose

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,840
age you want to check and then if there

00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,760
is something about time passing it

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,920
probably doesn't want to be in your UI

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,780
automation framework and so you do need

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,790
to make decisions about what happen your

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:09,870
UI framework and what not to wait

00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,600
instead of trying to work all this out

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:16,830
yourself as an automation engineer go

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:20,460
and talk to the developer who knows most

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:23,100
about the UI and say we did that and he

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,260
pretty much wrote our weight code for us

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,790
so that we're now really confident that

00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,710
we're not gonna have any problems with

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,800
weights and we going on that that's one

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,929
area where people don't trust UI

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,470
automation is hell I will wake weights

00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:39,750
that they're really just don't work but

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,550
if you talk to a development engineer

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,800
collaborate with them who knows about

00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,410
the UI JavaScript whatever it's written

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,040
and then you can actually develop a

00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,350
weight strategy that will work for you

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,300
um non-deterministic outcomes so what

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:58,530
what I mean by this is in our system

00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:01,050
it's a workflow system if you go into a

00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,840
work you what will happen is you'll come

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:06,260
out of that if there's more than one

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,600
thing in that work you the bottom or say

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,170
review again next if it's the only one

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,460
in there

00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:16,290
it will just say I've gotta move on and

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:20,730
so it's of what what you need is code

00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:22,500
around that to deal with that and then

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,000
beta independence I think thing that's

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,790
fairly clear everyone knows about that

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,980
we we will work well on that and we've

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,380
understood our data and it's strongly

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,730
because we wanted to run tests in

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,990
parallel and so you have to have

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,630
Intendant and each test needs a single

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:43,080
atomic purpose and that again I think it

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:45,090
is generally agreed out there so I the

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,980
sort of UI automation we're doing is not

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,900
in to end we're looking at having a

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:53,040
separate framework to do that but it is

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:54,900
not our core set of tests and then you

00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,970
also have to watch out for laziness in

00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,220
selecting data so it's not it's not the

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,620
test it's not the framework that flaky

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,289
it is the way that the test

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,900
our selecting data for it so again if we

00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:10,500
look at a work queue if everyone selects

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,370
the same option and you end up for the

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,740
same person

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:17,480
and so you end up when you do a search

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:20,610
on that with with a couple of hundred

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,919
records in the list it's the sort of

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,289
thing that can then slow your system

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,820
down and you don't really want that when

00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:28,740
you're testing and it's probably

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,600
unrealistic as well to think that that

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,950
person might be in the workflow several

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,409
hundred times they're more likely to be

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,960
in there once or twice and so it is

00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:38,909
crane an unrealistic situation which

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,210
slows down the tests and can cause

00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:43,980
failures so really you need to focus on

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,159
your director as well so that's that's

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:50,549
kind of my my view on why I don't think

00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:52,890
UI automation is flaky and I do trust it

00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,909
to do what we want but you can only do

00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:58,440
that if you focus on the quality of the

00:20:55,909 --> 00:21:02,940
automation framework that you build will

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:07,159
use so I'm marking safe from flaky tests

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:10,169
today trusting technical implementation

00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,510
so this is another area where maybe

00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:14,659
we're putting some tacit trust and maybe

00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,789
we can question what we are trusting

00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:19,679
first of all if we do get a failure in

00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:21,299
automation generally we'll look at the

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,429
automation suite and try and work out

00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,529
why that test is failing we won't

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:28,049
necessarily go to the system under test

00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:30,149
and think about actually is that the

00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:31,500
thing that's wrong and sometimes because

00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:34,140
we don't have the trust in the

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,240
automation framework we may well go back

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,820
and and change that test they go oh well

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,429
it must be the test that's wrong and not

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:44,880
the system under test and so you end up

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:48,330
with tests that verifying an error is

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,610
fine within your system and so looking

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,740
at trusting in that space is good as

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:58,320
well so you don't just blindly go I need

00:21:52,740 --> 00:22:00,059
to change my test also we put a lot of

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,289
trust in the unit and integration tests

00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:06,080
on well while we kind of feel that

00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:08,640
developers did a good job and they do do

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,850
what they could benefit from and again

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,149
is this idea of collaboration it would

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,559
be good to get testers and developers

00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:18,419
talking more about unit tests and

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,719
integration tests and so that so that

00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,429
the experience of the testers writing

00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:25,549
tests can be used by the developers to

00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,729
write their integration and unit tests

00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,889
again

00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:31,109
I've seen some unit tests and

00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:34,799
integration tests that I did they serve

00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:37,080
no purpose or are fundamentally wrong so

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,759
this is something that doesn't get

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,649
questioned as much we just trust the

00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:45,749
unit tests and integration tests are

00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:49,259
correct usually then as a test they're

00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:50,849
coming in to a new framework you will

00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:53,639
see that their steps they're available

00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:56,309
for you to create your test I really

00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:58,379
want people to question that and and

00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,999
especially if they're new to have a look

00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:02,580
at that statement doesn't do what you

00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:04,830
think again when I've come into a

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:07,289
framework that exists and we've been

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:10,229
running some tests and again it was

00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:12,719
around bait there was a step that said

00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:16,379
check date is correct or something or a

00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:18,089
service a correct date but when you look

00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:21,749
down in the code all it did was assert

00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:23,159
the format of the date and so you could

00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:25,409
have had a false impression that that

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,749
test was was asserting that the date was

00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:29,609
correct whereas it was just asserting

00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:35,759
the format of it was so all you knew

00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:38,009
that was it was displayed correctly also

00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,450
you've got got to think about how how

00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:41,099
much do you trust and how much do you

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,859
understand about your environments think

00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:46,169
Turing users so your environment is not

00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:48,149
the live environment or very rarely is I

00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:49,859
know there are various people who think

00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:53,729
that testing in my life is a good thing

00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:56,039
but not really so understanding the

00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:58,080
difference between what you're testing

00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,940
on your environment the data and the

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,399
users what is different there because

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,869
then you can understand the limitations

00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,969
of the testing you're doing and so

00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:08,489
you're not blindly trusting that your

00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:10,559
environment tells you is always going to

00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:14,039
tell you that something's gonna work in

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,739
life we have had situations and and

00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,269
they're very difficult to work out how

00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:20,429
how you would have tested it differently

00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:23,039
where something like the firewall in

00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:25,919
their life systems prevent has prevented

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,659
your change from working and you don't

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,920
generally have a firewall in your

00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,870
environment since the

00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,690
you need to think about well how do we

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,610
mitigate that in the future is there is

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,380
there a way or do we just have to put it

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:42,000
live and then check in that area

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,340
third-party tools and why do you trust

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,980
the ones that you pick so again I'll

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:51,300
pick selenium so generally we trust that

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:55,470
it's got a large user base and we know

00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:57,330
that in general it works okay but there

00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:03,600
are things wrong with it so either quick

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:05,510
look at the selenium get site and on the

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,150
10th of June I think it was it was an I

00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:11,880
349 open tickets so there's potentially

00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:15,180
349 things that you could say are wrong

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,860
with selenium poise is probably once

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,440
they actually analyze those and working

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,880
out this probably there may be a hundred

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,230
that made me officially something like

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,570
that and some of them might just be

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:27,000
improvements being suggested but we're

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:30,240
just think that that tool is correct and

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,830
and yet there's there are some bugs with

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,660
it and there have been fixes otherwise

00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,490
we wouldn't keep having releases then

00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,920
all new functionality this there's

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:40,590
usually some fixes in there as well and

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,000
so do we understand by taking a

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,810
third-party tool what its limitations

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,350
are on what what things there may be a

00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:53,160
kind of an error with it even using

00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:55,260
something I Excel I found when when I

00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:59,190
was producing some data in it once I

00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:01,440
found that there's there's a day back in

00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,590
I think is I think is around the term in

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,860
the century of nineteen know something

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:11,970
where Excel has got the date wrong and

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:14,880
so the the link year in 1900 exists

00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:17,430
innings in Excel and that caused me some

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,710
problems in my data generation so it

00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:22,260
there's there's things like that that

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:24,590
you possibly don't know about but could

00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:28,530
potentially cause you problems and so

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:30,660
you trust your trusting quite

00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:32,640
classically in a way some of these

00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:36,390
things were as they should be a bit more

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,580
questioning is what I'm proposing and

00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:42,060
then as you go on your trust in your

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,600
original idea is it still the right idea

00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,820
so

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,160
a project I worked on quite a few years

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,799
ago we started off with the idea that we

00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,860
would inject data for tests and directly

00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:55,980
into the database but as the system grew

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,840
etc that that becomes almost impossible

00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,080
because the database is changing so

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,570
you've got to change all these

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,490
injections whereas if you use the api's

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,049
you don't have to worry about the shape

00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,700
of the database you just have to make

00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:14,370
sure that that you interact with the API

00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:16,110
is correctly um this this is a picture I

00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:19,380
like to use in my presentations I've

00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:21,929
used it before and this is about models

00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,559
not being the truth so this this is a

00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:27,900
painting by Magritte it says this is not

00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,809
a pipe you might be thinking but that is

00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,669
a pipe isn't it and the idea was this

00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:35,850
McGorry called it the treachery of

00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:37,470
images and the idea is that yes it is a

00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,600
picture of a pipe but it's not the pipe

00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,700
itself so in the same way as I was

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,039
saying an environment is not your live

00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:47,549
environment you need to understand that

00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:49,289
there's differences and so I'm just

00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:51,120
going to do a kind of a little

00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:53,429
controversial challenge now about a

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,120
model that we use commonly thing test

00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:59,220
and that's the test pyramid so this is

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,419
not a test pyramid I can be pedantic and

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:05,610
say it's actually a triangle but I think

00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:08,700
people get too hung up on models like

00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,770
this so the original idea was and and

00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,200
kind of all you need to take from the

00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,210
test pyramid is that it's it's most

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,460
likely you're gonna have unit tests more

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,990
unit tests then you have integration

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,890
tests and you can have more integration

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:26,760
tests then you have automated UI tests

00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:29,700
or functional tests that you use of

00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,919
scripts that the users run but in

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,200
calling it a triangle in the way that we

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,610
do here it kind of looks like what all

00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,500
maybe if we had I don't know 420 or

00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:44,940
automated unit tests then we would go

00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:48,809
down to maybe 300 integration tests and

00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:52,110
only a hundred or something automated UI

00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:54,600
and and 50 other tests and so so kind of

00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,039
the world well it looks like it should

00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,739
give you you

00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:02,279
really clear way of doing approaching

00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:04,919
things we know or a lot of us know from

00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:06,830
doing some some test management test

00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,830
reports those kind of things that

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:13,049
counting tes isn't a good thing and so

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:16,529
just from that perspective it shouldn't

00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:20,220
be taken as as as gospel that that this

00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:23,009
is the way to do it and if you just

00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,669
google test pyramid software software

00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:28,710
testing pyramid you will see so many

00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:30,929
different versions of it that is unreal

00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,210
whereas the original one was just three

00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:35,580
layers just to get across that simple

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,929
idea and we kind of take these things to

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,139
heart and as you can see with the one

00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:41,489
that I I chose a people event tried to

00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:46,019
make it clear as to what it actually

00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:49,769
means but it still gets into that space

00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:54,479
of we're probably looking too much at

00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:59,700
this kind of space where we we take this

00:29:54,479 --> 00:30:02,220
for granted and power on I mean what

00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,070
what it kind of leaves us leaves left me

00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:08,729
in the space of thinking about was

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:10,559
for all of these then we we don't really

00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:14,669
know we don't have a good way of

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,639
counting down you should be able to stay

00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:20,489
I was thinking what we really want to

00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:22,769
get out of this kind of idea is that I

00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:26,779
could say okay this this function I'm

00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:30,059
testing here which we have a a spec form

00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:33,239
how do how do I work out how many you

00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:36,479
are my tests I've got how many API tests

00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:38,879
integration tests et cetera that are

00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:40,529
related to that function and that that's

00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:42,659
something that would be more interesting

00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:44,759
to me to find out coverage because we

00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,979
may find out that well I actually why

00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,869
we've got a look lot of UI tests we only

00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:50,820
have a few integration tests for that

00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:52,559
area and and then we can start

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,229
questioning whether that's right or not

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,570
and and the other aspect of this is is

00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:59,849
really kind of round flow we could have

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:02,340
conversations around the bottom half

00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:04,259
with developers and testers and we could

00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,789
have conversations between the

00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:10,669
automation testers and the

00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:12,649
the functional testers in terms of what

00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,720
coverage we've got I don't think those

00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:17,629
conversations down down this pyramid

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,789
that that I'm showing are happening as

00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:21,799
much as they should so we should be

00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:23,539
having more collaboration between all

00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:25,070
the people involved in writing these

00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:27,259
tests whether they're they're seen as

00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:29,149
developers or testers or automation

00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:33,200
engineers what whatever we want to call

00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:34,429
them so that that's just that an idea of

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,409
the kind of thing we should be doing

00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:38,929
with these models is questioning whether

00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:41,179
they are are correct or or what what

00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:45,350
should we be trying to get back them and

00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:46,940
not just taking them as the truth so

00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:51,049
here we go establishing trust and

00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:56,149
empowering so kind of kind of in this

00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:59,570
one I am not to react to people who do

00:31:56,149 --> 00:32:01,279
come in and micromanage me in a negative

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:04,009
way and so if I've chosen this little

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,330
cartoon to kind of illustrate that so on

00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:09,080
the plus side he has a plan and

00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:11,509
communicates well so I won't I will try

00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,970
not to react kind of micromanage

00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:16,639
children is one of my triggers and I

00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:18,049
really hate it but if somebody comes in

00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:20,450
and starts doing that I will try and

00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:22,580
understand that person first and then we

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,840
will work from there it's probably best

00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:29,869
way to put it

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:37,249
so from from I think I was looking for

00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:39,619
things so so I I also look for bias in

00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:43,720
this context as well to a certain extent

00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:46,220
and so everything I found is

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,679
confirmation bias because it kind of

00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,769
tells you what what I want to say and

00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:54,710
confirms that I'm correct of course so I

00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:57,769
found general crew likes lore of leaked

00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:00,619
laws of leadership and he was a u.s.

00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:02,269
Marine and I quite like his laws of

00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:06,559
leadership they kind of fit with the way

00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:09,379
I view trust and empowerment for the

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,539
teams that I work in so the first one is

00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:13,879
offer them the freedom to fail them with

00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:16,460
it the opportunity to succeed so it's

00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:19,230
given people space so they know they're

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,290
not going to get told off if they fail

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:24,570
but I'll give them everything they need

00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:28,260
everything I can give them to help them

00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:30,390
succeed micromanagement must become a

00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,910
thing of the past so as I said I hate

00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:35,460
being micromanage myself and I do try

00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:38,250
not to do it without this there are

00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:41,610
times when I find myself over explaining

00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:44,160
things because I'm I try and be aware of

00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:49,410
how I'm acting then that's something

00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:53,070
that I try and deal with yeah so any

00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:55,110
supervision is really there I try to do

00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,120
it through mentoring so if I'm helping

00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,740
someone else I might be seeing how

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,679
they're doing as well in some

00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,870
supervision but effectively I'm trying

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,440
to give them the thing what they need to

00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:09,210
complete their task don't totally agree

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,369
with this one but I haven't changed it

00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,080
so empower them certainly up for

00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:14,669
empowering them I don't know about

00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,619
holding them strictly accountable for

00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:18,210
their actions I would discuss if

00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,580
something did not happen the way we

00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:23,879
wanted it to how we could make it happen

00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,409
better another time for instance whether

00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,169
there's anything I could have done

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:32,369
better or what kind of actions we want

00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:33,720
to take and forward and I really like

00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:34,980
this last one aloud the leadership

00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:39,230
potential within each of them to

00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,879
flourish so I spend quite a bit of time

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:44,879
trying to understand the people I work

00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:46,470
with and what motivates them what skills

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,480
they have what they enjoy doing things

00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,909
like that and so that giving them that

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,399
and the trust to do things I feel like

00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:55,800
it gives them them a space to become

00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:57,930
leaders and it doesn't mean they have to

00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,480
lead a team but they can lead by example

00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:03,570
in terms of what they're doing and that

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,859
the knowledge and experience they have

00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:09,630
sharing that with others I've always

00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:12,150
been a fan of servant leadership there's

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:15,390
plenty of information out there about it

00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:18,320
so I'm there to serve them a team it's

00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:20,609
kind of a scrum master thing as well so

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,380
the scrum master is there to protect

00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:23,550
them from all the rubbish that goes on

00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,490
on the project that they don't need to

00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:29,160
know about but to help them deliver what

00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:30,600
they need to do so I always ask these

00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,309
kind of questions how can I better

00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,260
understand each person

00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:38,319
so by understanding them I can help them

00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:40,329
flourish how can I support their growth

00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:41,890
so identifying areas where they're not

00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:44,170
doing so well or all they want to learn

00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,030
something or identifying something maybe

00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:49,180
they don't even know about themself and

00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:51,280
so I can then suggest to them that maybe

00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,670
they could look at doing something in

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,400
that area I'm probably the most

00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:00,460
difficult on it is the team cohesion so

00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,890
in that area you can you can have

00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:05,109
conflict and I don't like conflict and

00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,869
so I try and talk to people individually

00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:11,710
to find out their views and then mediate

00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:13,599
or word-for-word there are occasions

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,960
where it's just not going to work people

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,760
people or so have have their belief

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,130
system which would be compromised by

00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,309
doing thing a certain way and so it

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:26,290
doesn't always work out but I do work

00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:27,790
hard at trying to keep the team together

00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,950
and keep them pushing in the same

00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:33,510
direction and then I found this thing

00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:37,960
munchy which which is a south korean

00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:40,809
concept but it's really like emotional

00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,099
intelligence and it is the subtle are an

00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:47,230
ability to listen engage others made so

00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:51,339
if you're in a stand-up for instance and

00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:53,170
you notice that somebody's other a lot

00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:56,710
less chirpy than they are usually for

00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:58,930
instance then you're kind of you're you

00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,609
need to then think about that whether it

00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,109
might just be a one-off thing or whether

00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:04,750
you should go and talk to them and and

00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:08,349
so you see what they need if they're

00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,970
consistently in in a Down mood then you

00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:11,619
really need to go and talk to them and

00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:15,549
find out if there's any way you can

00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:17,950
support them and by doing all this I I

00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:19,839
kind of feel that and it has happened in

00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,309
the past where people have come to me

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,619
because they see me as someone they

00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:25,869
trust and can approach and I've said

00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:27,670
I've got this thing going on I need to

00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:30,309
talk to someone about it I don't feel

00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,510
comfortable talking to X or Y and and so

00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:33,880
I've been able to sit down with them and

00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:36,220
help help them through the situations

00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,960
and and that first that's the kind of

00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:42,750
trust that I do try and build it in the

00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:46,220
teams that I'm in so suggestions for you

00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:48,650
have a trust audit what is he flattered

00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,210
what the heck do I mean by that so some

00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,000
people believed in the Flat Earth so

00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:56,500
much that it was very difficult and that

00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,500
there still is a Flat Earth Society

00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,470
vaguely remember a tweet saying

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,480
something like they have members in you

00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,070
know in all corners of the globe or

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,650
something like that all all around the

00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:08,240
globe so it's kind of an odd thing but

00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:13,849
there are still people who believe this

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,680
that the earth is flat and it all my

00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:18,020
challenges to you I guess is to think

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,580
about your project or your team and is

00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,740
there anything that you staunch you

00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:24,530
believe it is absolutely true them can

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:28,060
you challenge them like is it really

00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:30,590
true it's the question you want to ask

00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,030
who are your single points of trust so

00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,380
is there someone on your team that you

00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,599
always go to because you know they're a

00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,090
safe pair of hands how do you get out of

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,880
that situation because that person could

00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:42,020
leave how did you bring other people up

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,740
to it to that level

00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,720
a part of that is supporting your team's

00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,990
growth room and trust that that's why I

00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,900
believe so as I said earlier delegating

00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:56,030
without solution are using these single

00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,650
points of trust I would suggest you you

00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,750
approach them and ask them to be mentis

00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:04,310
further and and facilitate them

00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:05,930
knowledge sharing you and as a leader if

00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,150
you are leading in a team worried even

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:10,550
if you're not focus on collaboration how

00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,830
can you work better with people how how

00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:15,020
can you better understand them do they

00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:17,109
like to talk in long sentences or

00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:20,810
delayed doing work better in pictures

00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:23,210
I'm finally looking engage outside of

00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:26,240
your project so what are other projects

00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:31,369
doing how can you learn from that what

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,560
are other organizations doing and really

00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:36,050
what's the test community so it's so big

00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,700
QA babble were probably all involved in

00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:40,430
text in some way what are they talking

00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:43,339
about is important to you how can you

00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,880
bring that in who do you trust out there

00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,770
as well so

00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,599
so who is who saying things that then

00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:50,000
you connect with so maybe they're that

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,640
people to start connecting with but if

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,760
you stay just in the bubble of of your

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,430
project you're gonna miss out on a whole

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,900
lot but if you start interacting and

00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,339
getting trust out there

00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,069
into the wider community of your

00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:06,680
organization and commute other kind of

00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:12,650
test communities then that's pretty much

00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:14,920
gonna benefit you as well he said is

00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,920
that

00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,609
thank you very much Marty that was an

00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:21,770
awesome talk as expected this definitely

00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:23,779
got the gray matter going I've got some

00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,859
very some really good questions for you

00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:27,589
so I'm just gonna work my way back

00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:37,190
through the list so first question comes

00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:39,470
from Louise how would you empower

00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:43,579
someone he was not a leader to raise

00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:46,039
issues suggest or enact change okay I

00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:49,609
think it's it's knowing that person so

00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:51,520
for me I would I would say sit down I

00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:54,770
tend to sit down with each of my team

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,420
maybe on a quarterly basis if I can I

00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:59,210
don't always remember so I'm not I'm not

00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,160
brilliant but if that person is quite

00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:04,369
quiet they they may just want to talk to

00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,890
me through it and what I've done before

00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:08,869
is sit them in a meeting with somebody

00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,609
that they wanted to raise something to

00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:13,160
do and so kind of facilitate a

00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:15,460
conversation is about making feel

00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,799
comfortable in what they're presenting

00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,930
sometimes if it's been in a contentious

00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:23,720
situation and then I've I've had to be

00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:26,329
kind of the the message pastor as it

00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:29,450
were but in in a normal situation where

00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:35,119
they want to just say I think it'd be

00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:36,589
better to use this tool then I think the

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,140
other thing I was gonna mention was uh

00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:40,760
I've been involved in in improv as well

00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,510
and and it's kind of the whose line is

00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,809
it anyway

00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:47,839
and part of that is that there's a key

00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:51,200
kind of idea which is yes and so you

00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:53,150
don't cut off any ideas that come up you

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,539
kind of build on them so that if that

00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:59,180
person said I'd like I'd like to raise

00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:01,609
this but I'm not sure how and then you

00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,500
can say oh that's that's a good idea and

00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:05,119
this and this and that that kind of

00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,400
builds up builds them up and build up

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,170
their confidence so that while they they

00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,829
don't feel they can lead with it you're

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,400
there with them kind of delivering that

00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:15,290
that I

00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:21,260
to the team or to wherever we want to

00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:23,900
deliver yeah that's great thank you

00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,880
next question is from John if you're not

00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,200
using testers in your automation tests

00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,120
how are you ensuring the tests are

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:34,340
correct he says while doing the 3,000

00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:37,460
automated tests yes this comes back to a

00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,470
bit where well it was kind of a

00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:43,190
one-liner in him which is around do you

00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:46,180
trust your steps and some of the steps

00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:48,950
are quite a few years old and so with we

00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,750
I've been thinking about this especially

00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,840
doing this talk a lot racing these is

00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:56,120
how how how can I go back to those steps

00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,400
and say is this still doing what we

00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:02,720
think it should do we do find situations

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,820
where for instance we originally set up

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,370
a function that was going to check a

00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:09,800
table on a page but it would only check

00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,450
one table on a page and so somebody had

00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,880
kind of fudged it to check a second

00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:17,780
table because and you might end up with

00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:20,210
two tables on and so when that's noted

00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,800
we then create a Tector so we use the

00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:25,730
kind of the development process of

00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,740
detector to when we've identified

00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:31,910
something like that to then go back and

00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:34,010
change it but I do think it's that

00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:36,890
question is a really good one because we

00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:40,010
don't we don't know we're relying as as

00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:42,560
most automation frameworks do on the

00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:45,920
initial implementation of a step a being

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:49,220
correct and B being described correctly

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,560
in the step so if it is just a certain

00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:55,210
date format they should say that if it's

00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:57,500
a correct date it should say that but

00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:59,200
even though you don't know which format

00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,250
so this there's all these different

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,690
there's a whole language thing that

00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,790
needs to be there and you need to make

00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:07,610
sure your steps are correct and gives

00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:09,200
the right information but you also

00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,940
potentially need to have create some

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,290
space for people to go and check that

00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:16,460
those steps are doing the correct thing

00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:18,770
I would certainly encourage my my

00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:21,710
testers when they've written their tests

00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,870
to watch it run through in case there's

00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:27,700
anything visual they can see that it's

00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,700
not doing in the way they thought

00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,660
got question from Bama fellas I'll give

00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,890
him a quick shot as well he's an

00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,780
organizer for never a good meeting

00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:37,300
response called mid-set go and check

00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,250
that I can give some more good content

00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:43,070
ben says do your automated test create

00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:44,750
the test data they need as they run or

00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:47,060
does the data already exist in the

00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:50,570
database and testers use its own set of

00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:54,980
data so we have a mixture of things that

00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:56,630
there are some we have some some data

00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,670
that exists and we also have some

00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:01,220
factories I think I've talked about this

00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:05,930
on one of the linked off e1 so we have

00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:09,020
things like a factory of the will clone

00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:12,130
an existing service so a service exists

00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:15,910
in a certain state we can clone that and

00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:19,880
then make some small changes to it and

00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:21,980
then using the api's we then create that

00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,960
service and then that service is used

00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:27,380
just for that test because it's it's

00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,870
being created at that point and so we do

00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:32,090
create data on the fly and for some of

00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:36,440
it but there are other things like user

00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:39,350
data etc that it exists as we go so it's

00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,990
a bit of a mixture and like I said if if

00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:43,640
we don't have enough if people are being

00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:46,250
lazy when they write the test then they

00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,880
might pick the same data every time so

00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:51,440
the same user every time the same the

00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,200
same person going through the workflow

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,300
so it's it's a mixture of we need to

00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,430
make sure our testers are choosing the

00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:01,490
right data and we generate data but we

00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:03,740
also have some that exists at the

00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:06,290
beginning awesome thank you very much

00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,540
umm another question here from Emmett in

00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:10,580
DevOps where it is useful to have dev QA

00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,800
improved product environments as similar

00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:18,500
as possible can you still say testing

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:21,670
and production is not a good idea it's

00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:25,070
like my experience of this is is that I

00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:27,410
did work for a bank for a while and they

00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:31,220
they had the special way of testing in

00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:33,830
life in that they they had a branch

00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:36,500
which was a test branch but it was on

00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,570
the live network etc you can actually go

00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,550
into shops and buy things with cards

00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,780
from that

00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,760
and so that there was a whole load of

00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:45,470
security around it

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,470
there was agreements with shops because

00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:51,170
the people who did the shopping went in

00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:53,660
with with an unbranded car just a white

00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,760
card and so that they knew that I was

00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:58,130
acceptable but that that was one way I

00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,260
can see you could work in life because

00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:03,380
it was all accounted et cetera and

00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:10,010
properly done but if you go and test in

00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:12,560
life in other ways you you don't want to

00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:14,030
be protesting unless you've got a user

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,590
who's actually doing it and then you're

00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:20,810
you're doing the thing rather than

00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:23,930
testing you know it's there's there's a

00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:25,610
level at which you're you're no longer

00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:30,470
testing you're just doing and seeing if

00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:32,360
it works which is fine in a way if

00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:34,820
you're using that if you're using live

00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,470
data then you're doing the thing if

00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,230
you've got tests later in life I'm not

00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:40,820
sure that's a good idea either because

00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:43,580
we've seen problems with that maybe

00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:45,670
sending out letters to real customers

00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:48,710
and things on that as well

00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:50,690
right thank you um and of question here

00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,890
from John how do you best build trust

00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:56,110
with the product owners and other

00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:58,280
stakeholders I think I think that's

00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:02,810
that's more along the lines I mean you

00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:05,600
you have to build a relationship and you

00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:07,220
you are still you are serving them to it

00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,660
to a certain extent but you're also

00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:12,710
guiding them because you're the expert

00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:17,360
and so they may think they want a

00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:19,010
particular thing and if you if you can

00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,560
steer them away and help them understand

00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:23,510
how not to solution nice things then you

00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,030
can have those kind of conversations and

00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:28,490
and come back with what you need that

00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:31,820
the best projects have been on where

00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:35,870
I've seen it work was we had the product

00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:39,380
owner in I think it was most stand up

00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:42,140
seat he'd come along we had a better

00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:45,380
show-and-tell every week when we'd got

00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:47,540
maybe halfway through a sprint and had

00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,400
the front end of something working we

00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:51,350
didn't quite the min ago and this is

00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,240
what its gonna look like do you like it

00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:56,660
and so if you've got that

00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,390
of contact and an availability of a

00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:02,030
product owner then that's where it can

00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:05,510
really work and sometimes it's it's not

00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:07,160
your team's problem in a way is that the

00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:08,840
product owner isn't available and that

00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,300
that's what I've experienced as well as

00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,740
you they're often not there and so when

00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,590
when you eventually deliver the thing

00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,900
they said I don't like that and but they

00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,430
have not made themselves available and

00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,680
so you have to have those kind of

00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,810
conversations about how do you make

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,640
think that how do you get them to make

00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:27,470
themselves more available so you you

00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,950
have to do what you can to build the

00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:33,380
relationship some thank you very much

00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:35,570
mine so got a question here from Neil is

00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,070
this great presentation what tips or

00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:39,470
techniques do you have for regaining

00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:41,630
trust for me Trust is a difficult thing

00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:43,190
to gain an easy thing to lose what's

00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:48,170
work for you and your experience weight

00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:51,230
rule to gain trust um it's very much I

00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:53,869
always look forward so while we might

00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:56,650
need to discuss this this was the thing

00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:59,210
that happened that needs to be kept a

00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:02,030
factual level when you discuss the thing

00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:05,900
that happened so trying to keep the

00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:08,780
emotion out out out of it so I'm not

00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,820
going to start if you start accusing the

00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:13,040
client of being of not giving you the

00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:15,770
right requirements and things so there's

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,550
there's quite a bit about language and

00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:20,930
so if you start building up antagonism

00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,430
then then the trust is going to go

00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:24,440
because you're you're going to be

00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:27,740
separated and you need to kind of come

00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,480
together so while while they may have

00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,950
done some things that you don't agree

00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:36,200
with you need to keep your language

00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:39,380
neutral and explain what happened kind

00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,000
of to a certain extent the depending on

00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,920
who it is you might need to kind of

00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,820
humbly accept that something went wrong

00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:49,910
and you're gonna fix it but then it's

00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:52,100
the case of having a clear path forward

00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:54,200
for what's gonna happen next something

00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,880
that that they can see and then you can

00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,040
report on regularly and say oK we've

00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:01,100
done this this steps done we've done

00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,690
this this this steps done so it's it's

00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,960
very much a case of built building the

00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:07,030
trust again step by step and just by by

00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,900
proving that you're doing

00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:13,620
during what's needed and and keep a

00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,620
conversation going

00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:22,300
I've got one last question from rakau

00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:23,790
EEB form exploratory testing to a more

00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:28,420
trust

00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:30,070
um I because of the signs of projects

00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:32,320
I'm on I'm not really involved much in

00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:34,720
the in the exploratory testing I'm my

00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:37,030
kind of belief might the way where I've

00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,220
seen it work is is that kind of

00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:41,350
combination of what what I've said a

00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:46,060
little bit about in this presentation in

00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:49,150
terms of I think it's good to have not

00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:52,180
to kind of pigeonhole people and so I

00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:54,550
think a test through the test that and

00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:56,500
if I can do automation I might be able

00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:58,090
to do at different levels and and they

00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:01,960
would also have that kind of exploratory

00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:07,210
experience and so I think that that kind

00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:09,250
of thing it needs to be done I think if

00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:12,730
you can explain your exploratory testing

00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:14,350
and what would it change and and how

00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:16,000
it's better and more maintainable and

00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:19,360
kind of the benefits of it to a client

00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,820
in that kind of context of it's part of

00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:25,720
testing is what we do is having dinner

00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:28,150
well then I think that that's probably

00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:30,160
the way I would take if if I was kind of

00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:32,950
more in that space which I'm not on my

00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,240
current project I would I would kind of

00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,920
say that this is the way we're

00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,110
approaching testing some will be done

00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,760
through automation checks and we're

00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:43,300
gonna use exploratory testing this way

00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,420
and and just make it really clear to the

00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,800
client what that means

00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,390
thank you very much mass you know that's

00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,310
super appreciating relational rather

00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:53,680
about quite nicely for the one o'clock

00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:55,210
slot so just for you go guys and thank

00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,400
you so much again for being part stays

00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:59,710
QA bubble we've got lean coffee morning

00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,350
up tomorrow that kicks off at ATMs on

00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:04,030

part of that and we'll do the lean

00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:07,600
coffee morning based on today's

00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,550
discussion it's invite-only you know we

00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,710
