"Where did I put my trust?", with Martin Huckle

Overview:
“Where did I put my trust?” is an exploration of some of the areas in a software development project, with a stronger focus on testing, where we place our trust or withhold it. There will be a look at where acceptance of the current situation holds us back and how empowerment of your team can be a way to challenge accepted norms and increase trust.

Speaker bio:

Martin is an Automation Test Lead, mostly, currently working for BJSS as that combined with a development team lead role.
He has tried his hand at development and business analysis, now using both to his advantage to support improvements and innovation in automation in test. Very interested in supporting others in learning and personal growth. And in his spare time he does clowning amongst other things.
