Publication date: 2020-08-05
Playlist: QA Babble
Description: 
	QA Babble is organised by Woodrow Mercer as part of a live webinar and presented on YouTube by Pusher.

A very awesome Leigh Rathbone doing a brand new talk for us on a very exciting topic related to testing trends. Very interesting and relevant when looking at the market in trying to decide where to take your career next and things to look out for!

"Testing, and testers have gone through many changes. In my 20 years plus in testing, I've collected a lot of battle scars while working through those trends and changes, from the past, and right here right now. This puts me in a good place to try and think what the trends are for the future for testing, and for testers.
This talk will be relevant if you are a tester, test manager, or recruiter, the trends impact all
Buckle your seat belts, I'm going to relay this journey, this roller coaster, and then take any challenging questions people can put my way."
