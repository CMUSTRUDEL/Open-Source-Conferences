Don't Run Before You Can Walk, with Louise Gibbs

So you want to do test automation...

Demand for test automation developers is growing fast. It is now more essential than ever for testers to keep their skills current and up-to-date. Making the transition from traditional tester to test automation development can be a challenge, even more so if there is little support.

To become a test automation developer, there are things that the tester will need to learn. However, learning about test automation is not enough. Testers need experience in order to reach the level required to develop their own set to automated tests. For this, they need the support of their team to be successful.
During this talk, I will address common issues that prevent testers from getting started with test automation and discuss what can be done to alleviate these concerns. I will also talk about what testers themselves could be doing to acquire the desired knowledge and skills for test automation. Finally, I will examine what teams and organisations themselves could do to help testers gain the confidence and experience required to become test automation developers.
This is not just a talk for testers who want to get started with test automation. This talk will also benefit test automation developers and software teams who want to help colleagues develop skills in test automation development.

Key Takeaways:
Understand the challenges that testers face when attempting to become test automation developers
Identify what testers themselves could be doing to develop the skills required for test automation development
Suggest how the business and software team could be supporting testers so they can gain the experience required for test automation development

Louise currently works as a Senior QA Analyst for MandM Direct, an online fashion and sports retailer. She has been in testing since 2013 when she graduated from Bangor University with a degree in Computer Science for Business. Her first job after university was as a software tester for Loyalty Logistix, a company that produced Web, Mobile and Desktop applications that allowed members of the Automotive industry to run Loyalty schemes for customers.

She really enjoy talking about Software Testing. Everyoneâ€™s experiences are different, which means that everyone will have different opinions. Always keen to hear other peopleâ€™s stories on software testing as she believe this is the best way to learn and develop new ideas. Most importantly, she wants her own theories to be challenged as this also helps develop her own opinions further.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,069
and I'm a senior QA analyst at M&M

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,629
direct now one thing you may notice is

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,230
that my job title doesn't actually

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:12,509
include the word automation and Maeby's

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,509
advice I've never actually held a role

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,010
that specialized in test automation that

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,289
hasn't meant I haven't done any of it

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,300
and I've still got quite a lot of

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,039
experience no nothing means I'm telling

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,539
you this is because you don't have to be

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,260
you don't have to specialize in test

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,760
automation to do work to become and test

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,040
automation developer you can still do

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,500
that alongside the many other vital

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,719
roles but price of roles that are

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,540
involved in testing so before we I carry

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,730
on though I'm going to start with a

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,160
story

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,719
I used to do rock climbing it's love

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,879
rock climbing it was great fun I've done

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,370
it a little bit since not so much in

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,180
recent years and there is a very good

00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,390
reason for that on the 28th of May 2010

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,430
I went on a rock climbing trip in

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,850
Snowdonia I was rock climbing in the

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,770
cranberries pass and it didn't go too

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,799
well

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:14,369
unfortunately I an accident I fell 80

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,350
foot on the rock face fortunately I

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,229
didn't hit my head which probably would

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:24,710
have killed me I loved my legs but that

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:29,430
has a few other complications next right

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:33,060
yes so I broke both my femurs both

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:39,659
kneecaps my left ankle my right elbow

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:46,290
and a couple of ribs and listed impact

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:50,880
my ability to walk yes the x-ray there

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:56,119
is of my my ankle it's not supposed to

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:59,100
look like that you can imagine so

00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,619
obviously this wasn't permanent luckily

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:07,079
I did get better but this took a really

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:10,050
long time and so it took several months

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,680
of physio exercise and straight from my

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:17,879
legs again and until I was able to

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,810
walk again and even longer and ages the

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,250
photo on the right there is from are

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,439
they call fun run

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,099
I survived inside of the spouts I think

00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:32,549
was about nine months after the accident

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:35,879
and I signed up for the local Fun Run

00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:37,829
this is eight mile and I managed to walk

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,010
the entire way which time I was quite

00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:42,599
incredible for me actually I shouldn't

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,019
see my mom followed me with a wheelchair

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:49,049
in case I couldn't manage it so the

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,790
reason I tell me when when you something

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:53,909
about happened you don't go straight

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,489
into running a marathon you you it takes

00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:59,609
years of training you start small you

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,439
start easy and then and then you started

00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:03,930
builds up and even when I was able to

00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,659
walk again for about a year before I was

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,799
off the wheelchair permanently and it's

00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,220
probably but another two years after

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,519
that before I was walking without

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,699
crutches and and then even after that I

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:21,510
trained I continued to go to the gym

00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:23,220
continue to exercise and anyone who

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,139
knows me now we'll probably not realize

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,129
that I actually ever broke my legs I can

00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:32,220
walk perfectly fine now and I can quite

00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,799
comfortably run five kilometers but that

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,190
took many years a train it didn't didn't

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,190
happen at night

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,170
and also this is Alyssa but these folks

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,810
have taken 10 years ago so it's it's a

00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,590
it's a there is a long process involved

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,610
before you can actually

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,440
you start running again and the same

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,709
thing applies when you're doing test

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,390
automation you don't go straight into

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:03,160
creating tests you start small you start

00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:05,440
easy and so you might start easy you

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,840
start by just running the tests now even

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,370
if people say that they can't they can't

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,319
code or they're not technical um we are

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,730
working in IT that makes you technical

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,620
just because you can't code doesn't make

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,880
you test technical and even if you can't

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,650
code doesn't mean you can't learn to

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:27,400
code so you just start nice and easy you

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:30,370
run the tests and once you can run tests

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,350
you might then realize which one you

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,300
don't start analyzing the test results

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,130
looking at the ones that fail and look

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,900
at debugging working out why they're

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,510
failing sometimes it can be an issue

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,210
with the application that's been tested

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,430
sometimes it can finish you with the

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,750
test itself so you can investigate try

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,280
and find out why is the test failing and

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,460
when you've been realized why the tests

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,169
failing if it is an issue you can look

00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:02,979
at updating the existing tests making

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:04,750
small changes you you can have when when

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,380
you change make changes to an

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:10,690
application the tests will need to

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,910
update it so you can update the tests

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,280
and then has new features get out new

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,400
tests to it so you build up to that you

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,720
venture to do that and then finally

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,710
setting up entire test frameworks by

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,960
yourself so you don't need to ease into

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,610
the wrong don't don't go straight

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,610
straight into something have a full test

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,580
framework and creating new tests get to

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,850
know the application get to know their

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:43,090
tests are already there and before

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:45,070
actually running if we can walk told you

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,900
put my my story with my injuries I'll

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,700
tell you a little bit about my my actual

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:53,350
story of how I got into test automation

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,880
development um I I was looking up to you

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,640
I thought every night it's program since

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,830
I was school my first programming

00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,880
language and that was Pascal where I did

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:06,669
and I was doing a level computing I then

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,320
went to university where I studied

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:11,500
computer science and the main language

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,900
was Java we use many other languages as

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,580
well

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,229
but the idea is you want what you know

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,750
one language you understand how they

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:20,280
work you just you can then you can then

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,560
move into other programming languages

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,259
you know you don't need focus on one and

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:32,610
and then I started my first software

00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:33,810
testing sitting job and so what my first

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,370
says we have a software testing job

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,840
basically went through a whole year

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,900
where I didn't do any computer program

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,289
at all and but then I moved into

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,479
developing automated tests of this will

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:46,530
be B c-sharp and this is quite scary for

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,970
me cuz I've never done anything with C

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,090
sharp or at all it was a completely new

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,620
programming language but luckily because

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,229
I had my previous experience of

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,750
programming I was able to go straight

00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:59,910
into C shop without just just try

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,940
familiarize myself with the syntax and

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:06,930
then I was able to go into developing

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,789
automated tests now my first experience

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,810
didn't go so well and there were several

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:14,910
reasons for this at my job we had no

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,000
framework already in place so I was

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,130
developing a talk with Nick from scratch

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,770
but also we really didn't know what test

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,940
automation we saw the case of you want

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,190
to do it we want to do test automation

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,680
but we don't really think of why wants

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,330
to do it now my previous program

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,020
experience meant that I had that

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,449
confidence and that ability to learn

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,729
but then this wasn't really enough you

00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:41,280
know I obviously went it's partly my

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,870
fault partly the businesses fault when

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,370
someone said to test automation it was

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,490
almost a case of Oh me me me please I

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:53,760
want to do that you need me I was a bit

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:56,010
overeager so I think my confidence and

00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,320
that listen learn it helps but my first

00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:01,289
attempt didn't go so well luckily I was

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,639
able to learn from those mistakes and my

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:05,909
second attempt went a lot more

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,789
successfully so at least the first

00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:10,710
attempt at least I had that learning

00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:12,309
experience from it my experience which

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:17,289
did help

00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:18,909
help with success eventually so you know

00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,039
there is you need I think you need

00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:25,719
several things to be successful as a

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,669
test automation developer um and the

00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:30,009
first thing is they want that experience

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,479
you want to really understand how they

00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:36,879
work before going straight into

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:38,949
developing hold framework I once so

00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,469
these are some things I think you need

00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:45,329
if you want to be a successful test

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:47,350
automation engineer you need knowledge

00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:50,019
not just about test automation but you

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,939
also need knowledge about testing and I

00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:55,259
mentioned before that I've never been in

00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:57,309
a specialized test automation role I

00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,439
personally wouldn't want to be in a

00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:01,449
specialized test automation role other

00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:03,309
people may differ from that but that's

00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:05,879
just my personal preference and the

00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:10,149
reason being is I firmly believe that

00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:12,639
test automation it's part of the whole

00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:15,160
test strategy it's not the test strategy

00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:18,459
so you need to also have manual testing

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,279
involved in there as well and I also

00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:22,990
believe that I don't think I could make

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,029
the right decisions with regards to test

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,790
automation if I didn't have knowledge of

00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:31,050
the full strategy so I need to also have

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:34,420
experience from manual testing as well

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:38,170
and so you need knowledge of everything

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:40,990
not just test automation and then you

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,910
also need the skills to be come test

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,889
automation engineer so I remember

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,809
someone saying and unfortunately I have

00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,899
not be able to find where I heard this

00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:52,540
from the test automation engineer needs

00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:56,050
to have the testing mindset but develop

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,059
a skill set and imagine the most people

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,120
listening are already testers and

00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:02,259
already have the mindset you haven't

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,889
already you just need to get the skill

00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:11,470
set as well and you need experience um

00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:13,990
you know you need to actually have get

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,220
that experience not going to build and

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,890
typically I'll build on those skills

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,990
well

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:22,100
those three are what you need from

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,600
yourself that's what you need to to get

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,930
sales commitment information but you

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,670
also need to have supports and

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,990
opportunities provided by the business

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,850
that you work for business needs to

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,890
provide you with the opportunity to get

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,640
sessle's nation if you haven't got

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:43,560
opportunity you just just need to you

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,790
know you need to make mix of known make

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,640
you something that people know that you

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,720
are interested in being involved and

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,560
then they will give you the opportunity

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,680
and they also need to support it so that

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,440
means they need to any give you the

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,910
resources to learn and to practice and

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,280
to get that experience but also they

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,050
need to give you the support time and

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,840
the resources to actually continue

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,780
developing the tests if you're spending

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,460
if they're giving you all this work on

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,320
testings manually then you're not gonna

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,130
have a time for test automation so they

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,980
need to actually allocating that time

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:26,460
and provide you opportunity I was carry

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,410
on with it and then finally any

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,520
confidence and that is going to come

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,650
from both that yourself

00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,110
break it by developing these skills and

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:36,510
knowledge and experience also from the

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,710
business too you need to have things for

00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:42,180
both yourself and from the business so

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:45,240
I'll talk about what you can do what you

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:48,030
is personally first thing you can meet

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,880
Lance code there are a lot of tools out

00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,430
there that I'm codelist tools out there

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:58,140
but there's not always guarantee that

00:11:53,430 --> 00:12:01,830
the business is going to provide those

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:06,690
particular resources they may prefer to

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:10,440
choose to use a framework that is but as

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:12,330
more code heavy so just prepare for that

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,300
situation you want to you want to learn

00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,300
to code if you already if you're if

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,250
you're working for a business is already

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,050
users test automation find out what

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:26,760
language that programming language they

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:28,110
use and learn that if you don't you

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,050
popular ones Python

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:34,410
the most popular ones most of my

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:37,140
experience to be in c-sharp so one of

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,670
those three is a good one and then don't

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,910
just learn the language you need to

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:45,420
actually practice it you know simple

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,820
small small simple coding exercises I

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,190
put a picture of a book there Python for

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,720
example I've chosen that one because

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,130
this year I decided to learn Python no

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,690
particular reason I just wanted to see

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,930
whether I could learn a new programming

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,760
language and I started by buying a book

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,560
and I chose this book just because it

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,230
included that slogan on the front

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,860
learning's programming 150 challenges um

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,930
I love this book because it's um it

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,870
doesn't go into these deep explanations

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,970
about how things work it shows you code

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,600
examples so that you can then learn from

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,920
them it's definitely a book that I would

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,079
recommend if you want to learn to

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,019
program and just work your way through

00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,089
the exercises that are in this book it

00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,930
just provides rides enough explanation

00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:37,019
but doesn't doesn't pick me Amy Phil

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:39,000
doesn't have one over x too much

00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:42,870
explanation I mean maybe for I'm scared

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,300
to learn it and so that won't be a book

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:48,580
I recommend

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,410
also obvious ones code also learn about

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,200
test automation also actually testing in

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:55,600
general so watch webinars meetups

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,240
conferences read blogs and articles and

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,220
also just talk to people here are the

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,800
people's stories and their about how

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,130
they learned and then see how what you

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,770
could apply from that and just learn

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:13,090
about just generally like learn about

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:15,280
the best practices and so I was going a

00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,020
bit cranky there learn about general

00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,610
best practice to test automation learn

00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:22,360
about how other businesses have applied

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:25,330
it and you know use that knowledge to

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:30,970
think about how your current company

00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:35,680
could write best apply it coming in test

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:36,700
automation advocate so I mentioned the

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,000
business needs provide you the

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:43,930
opportunity they need to know that you

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,560
are interested in it so talk about what

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,700
you've learned

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,130
talk about your skills become known

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,870
within business say I want to be

00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,840
involved in test automation developments

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,950
and because they may not provide you the

00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,740
opportunity if they don't know you're

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,630
interested so talk about if they and if

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,220
that business isn't actually just

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,520
actually have a frame test automation

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:10,300
framework in place yet talk about the

00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:12,780
benefits of it um know that it might be

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,040
something worth doing so that they then

00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:17,200
try to get involved themselves but

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,840
finding or I also mentioned the other

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,570
testing skills test automation isn't the

00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,510
only thing you need to know you'd look

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,650
at other test planning tests very much

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,170
tester needs anything

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:33,570
don't just focus on test automation

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:36,790
those of you who work for a business

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,320
let's use who are already what a

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,460
business that already have a friend in

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,210
place or two you may be heading a team

00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,250
that's want to introduce test automation

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,720
the first thing you need to do is

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,960
provide time and resources for

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,420
development and maintenance of the tests

00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,650
once the experience of a see what the

00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,780
tests in place

00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,700
you're not going you know it's not going

00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:05,570
to end there you need to continue that

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:08,170
is it's not journey but there isn't

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:12,100
always like I said destination applies

00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:15,500
to you you know as application changes

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,630
the testers will also need to change now

00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,740
if you don't already have an automation

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:24,700
framework in place please don't do what

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,650
happened to me don't give it to someone

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,120
reservoir the experience yet yes so if

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,210
you are working for business that

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,430
doesn't yet have automation isn't yet

00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,950
using test automation and you want to

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,130
get started don't give the tasks to

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,720
someone without experience

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:46,430
it will probably absolutely terrifying

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,950
for them give them you want to maybe if

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,650
you haven't got anyone in the testing

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,750
team with fat knowledge experience maybe

00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:56,930
ask the developer to help them get

00:16:53,750 --> 00:17:00,080
started um probably better hire someone

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,360
with experience but don't don't give the

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:07,840
job to one person you want to involve

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:10,040
the entire testing team you want them to

00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,720
you want to Train involve the entire

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,450
testing team in those decisions of how

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,740
to set up the framework how what tests

00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:20,270
to create what tests will benefit the

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,530
what will be most benefits you want to

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,980
actually talk to them as well so get

00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:27,220
involve the test team entire testing

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,990
regardless of experience in automation

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:33,440
they will they'll at least have

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:36,410
knowledge on how how best to how all the

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,360
test strategy and give you that and

00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,850
provide feedback on how an idea is about

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,080
how best to apply it now if you already

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,210
have an automation framework in place

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,050
you want to provide the opportunity for

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:51,470
testers to get involved and don't give

00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:54,140
it to a single person with all because

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,940
they say about one person leaves

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,070
business suddenly all that knowledge is

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,460
gone so you want to get as many people

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:04,090
on board as possible and allocate time

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,260
for learning coaching so that they can

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,290
get an always give them that opportunity

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,180
to get involved

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,090
and funny really encourage people to get

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,070
involved don't force them test

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:21,030
automation isn't the only thing that

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:23,260
testers need to do and it's it it is

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,330
there are many other ways that some

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,600
tests for tester may want to develop

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:33,040
their career so if and if they're not

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:35,500
interested or it might be the recent

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,060
believe the reasons are um even but not

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,980
interested at all or they don't have a

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:45,100
confidence so right that encouragement

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:47,830
but don't force them don't say you have

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,970
to do this there are other ways which in

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,700
which they can get involved and

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:56,050
contributes to the overall testing

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,330
effort so you know it's quite a general

00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,770
thing it's not

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:05,290
Tesla's mission isn't the only thing

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:07,320
that you're doing so I'm gonna talk

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,910
about one of the best ways I found with

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,790
encouraging testers happened about that

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:16,570
incorrect my confidence is using pair

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:18,640
programming don't throw him straight in

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:22,150
there into the deep end and developing

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,370
alone and so I always start with like

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,990
start is some doing demonstrations on

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:31,000
how showing them how a test set up

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:32,680
sometimes if I've had a dated test like

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,900
so do you think I really should be

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,150
showing up a team this I've almost like

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,510
undone all my work and then starting

00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,030
from scratch

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,760
showing them how I did it explaining how

00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:45,160
the tester set up explaining the process

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,780
or updating a group and test how you

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,300
might debug something and then fix it

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,610
and also the process of creating new

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,560
Trece tests from scratch show them what

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:57,310
you do setting up the locators and then

00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,560
test but explaining how it's done I

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:03,640
found this is actually also not good for

00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:05,710
the developer as well because I always

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,050
say like you can't explain something

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,750
simply and he probably didn't understand

00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,490
it in the first place so try and explain

00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,320
it good practice to try to explain

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,559
something and just see what your

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,410
knowledge actually is

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,510
next day would be to almost the tester

00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,179
to update or write tests but this time

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,320
provide them with detailed instructions

00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:29,660
now I've suddenly found this is a lot

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,419
easier with screen sharing and something

00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,760
I definitely found with remote working

00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:36,380
because I can't intervene at all I the

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,600
tester is sharing the screen I had to

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,250
give them the instructions and I can't

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,110
go hang on let me do this for you you

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,370
can't do that I've got to give them

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,919
instructions it's something easier in

00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,960
that with remote working but yeah just

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,510
ask them to update the test provide them

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,660
a detailed verbal instructions talk of

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,740
who the process tell them what to do and

00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,860
gradually they'll understand what

00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,140
they're doing obviously then once they

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,870
are at our stage you can just give them

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,410
an awesome to update test but get them

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,640
to do it

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:09,230
observe watch them do it and maybe ask

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,360
them to explain what they're doing so

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:15,470
that you can see if their understanding

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,600
is as good as they think is and also if

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,549
they are stuck or about to make mistake

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,179
then you need to intervene jumping is oh

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:25,880
no I actually don't do that you know so

00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:29,059
gradually you'll find that those moments

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:32,059
will become less and less and then

00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:33,740
finally get into the belt alone ask them

00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,250
to create testimony without being

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,260
observed

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:40,160
but obviously be available to help out

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,460
if required um brains even though our

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,870
most in most experienced developer will

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,860
ask for help me it may need to ask for

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,860
help from other people occasionally

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,360
okay so view don't you know there isn't

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,490
that you can't there yes possible there

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,440
is nothing that you can't learn but you

00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,409
shouldn't learn everything don't know

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,120
nobody will understand everything so

00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:06,990
there will be people within the team who

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,890
have different specialisms and they but

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,150
many have a general knowledge of

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,430
everything else

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,900
so and also I think the big crushes

00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:18,010
don't be afraid to ask for help if you

00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,420
need it so and actually make the tests

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,920
are aware of that make the tester aware

00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,740
that they don't need to know everything

00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,300
they can ask for help

00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,670
and I'll see us my final point actually

00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,490
really um don't try to learn everything

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:32,810
at once really don't you don't need to

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,820
understand everything will just overload

00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,230
your brain um I know that with the

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,340
current situation there is a lot of

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:41,720
pressure to upskill and loving you you

00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,450
know you can't go out but then I think

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:49,340
that can cause a real strain on your

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,690
mental health so you know keep bring

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,780
back to my original message don't run

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,400
before we walk um keep learn things

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:59,210
slowly maybe come up with a plan of what

00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:03,080
to learn and take it one at a time

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,730
don't go straight into it getting into

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,710
test automation development it's gonna

00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:12,710
be a journey it's gonna take time and

00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:16,940
need to get that experience and even

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:18,740
when you are a leaf edge test automation

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,480
developer the learning won't end there

00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:24,760
you need to continue learning beyond

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,760
that's don't don't never it never stops

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:30,280
so that's them that's all I've got there

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,100
I just take a bit time to talk about

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,860
some of my current projects I said I'm

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,380
not just learning I'm not just

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,170
throughout not just studying test

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,330
automation I am learning other things so

00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:47,950
as I mentioned I have my blog Louie

00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:49,930
Skip's test WordPress comm one thing

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,030
I've been doing a lot with the current

00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,070
situation I've been watching a lot of

00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,330
webinars and posting sketch notes of

00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,210
them and you will find a lot of them on

00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,490
my blog I'm also at the moment trying to

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,080
complete my 30 days of quality challenge

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,090
which was set by the Ministry of testing

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,970
I am gonna provide a little link about

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,590
that in the next slide and it's

00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,160
literally it's taking a bit more than 30

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,350
days

00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:15,130
right I mean I mean taking for two

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:16,780
months now but it's off I don't feel I

00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,140
think it comes with try anything once

00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,010
don't feel pressure to keep so going

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,460
through that thinking you thing you'll

00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:26,770
just exhaust yourself if I was taking

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,810
very rigidly to about 30 days to do that

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,360
challenge I probably would have just

00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,250
given up right within within my day

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,100
three or something

00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:38,020
so and also I might sort by that because

00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,400
I'm not just learning about coding I'm

00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,780
not just letting my programming I'm

00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,970
learning about other things as well

00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,930
other things around testing and one

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,730
thing about this challenge is having

00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,740
really really make me rethink my

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,900
definition of quality so I'm really

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,180
enjoying that challenge at the moment I

00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,440
mentioned that I'm learning Python I'm

00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:57,070
going through the exercise in the book

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,570
Python by example and also I really

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,460
discovered these things called Python

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,710
cones and I won't have a link on that

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,330
for the next page and all tests are

00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,640
already set up but they're all failing

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:10,570
and you have to just work through them

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,360
and make the test pass and I'm like

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:16,810
that's quite good exercise to do because

00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:19,060
you're um you're learning you have the

00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,020
code already there so you know pretty

00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,390
much scratching for what about things

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,730
you're essentially debugging tests on

00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:27,970
failing so it's a good exercise to go

00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:30,220
through and also this has actually quite

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,990
inspired me to set my own the whole

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,240
thing called fix a spec flow test know

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,980
we are you spec through I do speculate

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,410
quite a lot for test automation in my

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,640
career I absolutely love it it's a great

00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,580
thing and I'm just sort of coming around

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,620
writing my own tests but I've been

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,660
feeling just like the Python codes that

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,060
someone has to fix the ones I've prayed

00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,250
already I test on my parents I'm going

00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,500
program experienced at all and they were

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,380
pretty successful and I quite enjoyed

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,370
the challenge so they're not ready yet

00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:01,990
but when they are I will be sharing them

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:05,050
and also I'm not just doing things

00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:08,380
relates testing I have been trying to

00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,700
sing part in a little fundraiser some of

00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,980
you might have heard about 26 challenge

00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,680
I think they chose 26 because the name

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:18,970
for London - which was unfortunately

00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,610
cancelled a lot of charities are unable

00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,350
to do their fundraising anymore and they

00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:28,510
are struggling quite a lot because the

00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:29,980
current current pandemic so I have taken

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,330
part in a little fundraiser

00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:35,350
I'm raising money for the Teenage Cancer

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,640
Trust if anyone can donate you know it's

00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:39,970
just a couple of quid I'll be so

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,260
grateful and what I'm doing is I'm just

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,560
doing a little sewing challenge for

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:48,880
myself all relating them the number 26

00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:51,539
or 2.6 so hopefully if you can they'll

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,450
be really grateful

00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:57,149
just resources that may help you the

00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,399
test automation University they have

00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:00,899
courses related to so many different

00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:03,419
areas of test automation so if there's a

00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:05,789
particular tool that you need you want

00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:08,789
to familiarize yourself with this they

00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:10,590
have several courses on Drazen various

00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:13,379
different tools and frameworks which you

00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,119
can which may help you learn will help

00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:18,239
you get started at least and it's all

00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:21,210
three the quite there's the link for the

00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:24,029
Python cones I was telling you about and

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,940
they're on github you just need to get a

00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:28,169
github repository and the instructions I

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,070
think there were some instructions how

00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:32,369
to get started with that

00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:34,019
um majorie testing are a great place to

00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:36,210
go to you for learning they have so many

00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,519
webinars meetups um

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,919
I mentioned my 30 days of quality you

00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:45,269
will find 30 days of testing it knows

00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:47,340
that link there aren't many challenges

00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:48,330
on their 30-day challenges so if you

00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,429
want to learn something new

00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,440
one of those challenges a good way to

00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:54,720
get started there's one for API testing

00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,099
there's one for there's one for

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,409
exploratory testing there's one for test

00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:00,690
automation doing the quality one at the

00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:03,599
moment at the moment they've recently

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,720
released their ops one so that's always

00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,190
a good place to go to and obviously then

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,019
I'm running a lot of meetups and

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:13,019
recording them they're always a good

00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:15,059
place to go to they also have conference

00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,950
talks talks with their conferences

00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:20,399
available on there most of them you have

00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:22,830
to have a a pro account which costs a

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,080
con of how much it costs but you can

00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,710
sign a free Club account and they have a

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,419
small number of them free and and also

00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,830
just going out there and meeting people

00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,809
is always a great way to that as well

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,710
and if you go to meetup.com is probably

00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:39,840
how you go on so this talk itself it's

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,559
great way to learn obviously with the

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,259
current situation they're all online now

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,940
which but it's Russian camp your

00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:51,250
learning webinars are still a great way

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,880
to meet people ask questions

00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:55,990
I brought mention my sketchnotes I

00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:01,270
thought I'd share this one only because

00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:04,390
it's um it involves from my talk do we

00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:06,039
need to be an STI T or C social web

00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:08,409
developer in tests which one of many

00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:11,020
names for a test automation developer um

00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:13,960
I like this one because it emphasizes

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:16,750
that you don't need to focus on there

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,200
are many other get the weight other

00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:22,120
areas have specialized skills in and

00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,140
also includes a possible journey for

00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,429
building test scores

00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,020
now this isn't one that you might want

00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:29,230
to follow it depends entirely on what is

00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:31,299
beneficial to you and the business

00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,480
you're currently working on but it's

00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:36,220
still an interesting one to look at it

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,279
may be a good example of an adjournment

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:43,770
you may want to set up for yourself

00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:46,779
um all these slides are available um I

00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:48,190
put a link up on my blog if you want to

00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:50,500
download these slides and in course

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,029
includes all my sketch notes as well

00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,909
which you may find interesting to look

00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:57,700
at and I realized I didn't put a slide

00:29:54,909 --> 00:30:01,740
on there for any questions so I lost now

00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,740
