Don't Run Before You Can Walk, with Louise Gibbs

So you want to do test automation...

Demand for test automation developers is growing fast. It is now more essential than ever for testers to keep their skills current and up-to-date. Making the transition from traditional tester to test automation development can be a challenge, even more so if there is little support.

To become a test automation developer, there are things that the tester will need to learn. However, learning about test automation is not enough. Testers need experience in order to reach the level required to develop their own set to automated tests. For this, they need the support of their team to be successful.
During this talk, I will address common issues that prevent testers from getting started with test automation and discuss what can be done to alleviate these concerns. I will also talk about what testers themselves could be doing to acquire the desired knowledge and skills for test automation. Finally, I will examine what teams and organisations themselves could do to help testers gain the confidence and experience required to become test automation developers.
This is not just a talk for testers who want to get started with test automation. This talk will also benefit test automation developers and software teams who want to help colleagues develop skills in test automation development.

Key Takeaways:
Understand the challenges that testers face when attempting to become test automation developers
Identify what testers themselves could be doing to develop the skills required for test automation development
Suggest how the business and software team could be supporting testers so they can gain the experience required for test automation development

Louise currently works as a Senior QA Analyst for MandM Direct, an online fashion and sports retailer. She has been in testing since 2013 when she graduated from Bangor University with a degree in Computer Science for Business. Her first job after university was as a software tester for Loyalty Logistix, a company that produced Web, Mobile and Desktop applications that allowed members of the Automotive industry to run Loyalty schemes for customers.

She really enjoy talking about Software Testing. Everyone’s experiences are different, which means that everyone will have different opinions. Always keen to hear other people’s stories on software testing as she believe this is the best way to learn and develop new ideas. Most importantly, she wants her own theories to be challenged as this also helps develop her own opinions further.
