Title: MountainWest Devops 2014 - Cooking at Shopify: Taming a busy kitchen with many Chefs
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: MountainWest DevOps 2014
Description: 
	By Phil Cohen

We use Chef to manage a large and rapidly growing infrastructure at Shopify. Our cookbooks are open to development not only by our Operations Team, but by all 200+ developers at the company, and we manage to maintain an environment of continuous delivery and continuous improvement for our infrastructure. I'll talk about some of our workflows, internal tooling, and security considerations when operating at our scale.

alright so this talk is titled cooking

00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,870
at Shopify although i'm going to make it

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,379
a little bit more generic and talk a bit

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,030
about DevOps in general at Shopify as

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,790
opposed to just cooking with chef

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,879
because DevOps is a lot more than just

00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,470
one tool and the main tool we use is not

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,520
open source at the moment either so I

00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,920
don't to bore you with details of

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,520
something you can't see other than to

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,680
talk about it so we've seen that a

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,930
couple shows of hands already but just

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,100
start off how many people here consider

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,140
themselves a devops engineer you're all

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,850
wrong there is no such role as a devops

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:15,390
engineer thank you alright so we'll be

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,280
talking a little bit about DevOps I'm

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,869
glad there's a split here between people

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,690
who consider themselves developers and

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,820
ops people hopefully the developers can

00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,430
pick up a couple tips and the ops can

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,000
heckle me later and you can swap that

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,010
around too if you want also this is

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,290
going to be a bit of a hybrid talk we've

00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,430
had some tools talks some culture talks

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:41,670
this is a little bit both about how we

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:43,320
make stuff work at Shopify so I want to

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,460
thank Mountain West first of all Mike

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,950
and Pat you guys put on an awesome

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,650
conference and really really thrilled to

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,909
be here and also just want to take a

00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:57,240
minute and remember Jim wyrick one month

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,159
ago today we lost Jim and he was in my

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,229
opinion the original Ruby hero or at

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,869
least my original Ruby hero and his

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,119
impacts both directly and indirectly on

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,670
me i was pretty profound and I wouldn't

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:15,030
be here if it weren't for him so moment

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:16,920
for for Jim so sorry that looks a little

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,579
fuzzy and washed but hopefully you can

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,200
read it so real quick i'm going to give

00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:26,579
a little bit of background about myself

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:30,190
out shopify the company Shopify the

00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:34,870
platform who runs Shopify

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:38,340
and how we were on Shopify so I'm Phil

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:41,380
Cohen slides a little tough to read but

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,090
that's an image from our internal

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,450
employee directory work on the

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,610
operations team at Shopify Phil Cohen at

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,420
Shopify com if you want to track me down

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,820
you don't get my phone number today I

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,670
work remotely i live in the Lake Tahoe

00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:01,690
area of California working my way

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:05,620
towards ultimate mage status blom age

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,610
status maybe and i joined images a

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,760
little bit at date I've been with

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,010
Shopify about 11 months and something

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,370
that you can't see on there but that

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,830
will come back to is a kind of next to

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,140
where it's as I joined that says about

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:24,130
forty-eight percent of the company

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,390
Shopify is joined after me which

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,580
considering the company has been around

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,170
since about two thousand four and I've

00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:34,300
only been there for 11 months is a

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:37,360
pretty incredible growth trajectory been

00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,100
working with chef for a little over five

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,550
years now since it was in its infancy

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,530
I've been doing ops and DevOps and that

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,270
sort of thing a lot longer than that and

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:51,480
I care about things like automation

00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:54,220
reliability testing and moving fast

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,950
which can be roughly categorized maybe

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,840
as continuous delivery I care about that

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,090
both the application and the

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,019
infrastructure standpoint be talking a

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,150
little bit about the infrastructure

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,920
today but pretty much i'm a lazy

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,060
engineer and i'm working in the ops

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,940
demain currently so a a little bit about

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:16,030
Shopify shop last mission is to make

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,709
commerce better primarily where commerce

00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,799
platform and most people probably know

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:23,740
us for our e-commerce solution I can set

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,750
up a web shop recently we have also

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:31,360
launched a point-of-sale mobile sales

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,310
mobile payments Shopify payments number

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,620
of other solutions that all fall under

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,890
the commerce umbrella with the goal of

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:43,020
making things easier to sell and share

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:45,300
shopify is also an established code base

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,320
so for the rails devs in the house it's

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,750
one of the oldest and most continuously

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,630
developed code bases for a rails app out

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,050
there it's over nine years old I guess

00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:01,350
that makes it legacy these days started

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,120
pre rail pre one point o rails and as of

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:07,110
today we're running on the latest Ruby

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,500
21 rails for had been running on a

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,640
single server we're not anymore quick

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,800
little bit of trivia as I was looking

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,870
through the get history very first get

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:23,360
commit message is whoops bring it in

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:29,760
from svn so it's a legacy app it happens

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:32,760
so Shopify is large these days scale is

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,470
about perspective so i would say large

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,020
is a good term at least compared to most

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,160
rails apps we're rapidly approaching a

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,110
hundred thousand shops on the platform

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,380
closing in on 4 billion dollars of roast

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,560
merchant volume almost 72 million

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,690
products sold across the platform these

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,880
days we have about 400 employees the

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,330
other day when i looked i think is 393

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,400
so close enough and in december we

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:04,620
closed a hundred-million-dollar round

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,480
series c round of funding so the scale

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,790
in which we're working both in terms of

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,710
traffic people funding is pretty large

00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:17,570
we do move a fair amount of traffic over

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:19,980
Black Friday Cyber Monday in 2013

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,740
Shopify was the number three platform

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,260
for unique IP traffic behind amazon and

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,560
ebay beating out walmart sony best buy

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:32,280
and some others so we definitely have a

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,490
fair amount of traffic on a quiet day we

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,380
sustain on over a hundred thousand RPM

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,380
that bursts up to well over a million

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:45,090
during flash sales or load testing or

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:47,100
other network anomalies we did also we

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,320
had a merchant this year

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,120
have an add-on during the Super Bowl and

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,610
we saw in eighteen thousand percent

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,230
roughly increase in traffic for that

00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:00,930
shop so that was pretty interesting and

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:04,770
impressive and in addition to being

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:07,260
large we're also growing so back to the

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,810
forty-eight percent have joined after me

00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,040
within the last 11 months if you look at

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,600
that little link on the side that says

00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,010
join graph you can see sort of the

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,680
accelerating rate at which people are

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,600
coming on board also now that you're

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,300
excited we're hiring so come see me

00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,310
after if anybody's interested in the job

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:32,420
I've also got some stickers and happy to

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:34,880
chat about whatever so this growth rate

00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:39,470
presents some interesting challenges

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,720
that will get to so that was the company

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,210
Shopify the platform so I mentioned we

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,080
have our e-commerce platform

00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:51,300
point-of-sale etc these days takes more

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,830
than a single server and we have lots of

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,580
different pieces in there so just for

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:59,790
some perspective what we refer to as

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,760
tier 1 which are services that need to

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,640
be running to provide check outs and

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,260
sort of provide our core functionality

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,900
we have the main Shopify application

00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,940
which is the core app management

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,970
reporting etc that you see when you log

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:18,750
in all of our API everything that runs

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:21,150
sort of the core systems runs primarily

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,310
on bare metal with several hundred

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,870
servers within the next few months we're

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,720
bringing a second data center online

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:31,050
with full replication of that so that

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,880
will be doubling as well we have a

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,370
system we call imagery which sits behind

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,800
our CDN and so when we resize product

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,650
images etc things like that that happens

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,440
real time on the fly image gets

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,440
processed and then dropped on a CDN that

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,220
runs on a cluster

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,740
and amazon cloud we have a large search

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,840
cluster currently running elastic search

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:59,810
which is kind of like a database but a

00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:02,540
really needy one and we run I hesitate

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:05,450
to say all the databases but primarily

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,980
Shopify runs on MySQL there's some

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,180
interesting talks from big Ruby and some

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,210
other conferences if you want to look up

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,700
about how we shard mysql and run that

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,890
interesting cluster but we also run

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:21,140
postgres sky DB hadoop vertica MongoDB

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,060
many other pieces all required to get

00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,700
various aspects of the system running so

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,310
there's a fair amount of moving parts

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,740
also on tier 1 we have card server which

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,420
is basically our PCI environment where

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,120
we handle the credit card processing

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,530
small app that's separated from the rest

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,660
of the infrastructure which makes

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:42,740
keeping security auditing things like

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:45,140
that a little easier a little safer it's

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,180
got limited access you know in terms of

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,790
who can access it and all of our

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,130
monitoring logging etc things like that

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:56,120
or also duplicated and isolated to work

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:58,580
in that environment we've got a tier 2

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,290
platform which is not to say it's any

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,940
less important but these are things that

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,160
won't directly affect a check out or

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,960
prevent a sale from happening but are

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,380
basically required for a normal

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,950
operation of the site the Shopify

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,200
platform so to speak has an app store a

00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,570
theme store an expert's store where you

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,960
can find people who can help you set up

00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:23,810
your shop or build custom integrations

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,850
forums a number of other sort of tier 2

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,610
properties that are required for keeping

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:31,580
the site running and then we also have

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,860
your tier 3 and internal which are

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,640
things like our international brochure

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,650
sites partner portals in Asia we're

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,860
partnered with singtel for example who

00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:45,350
handles onboarding and Singapore our

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,150
gurus and support people we have an

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,870
internal phone system for example built

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:53,120
on twilio ticketing systems data

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,520
analysis and reporting for business

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,340
intelligence

00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,790
if there's such a word research a bee

00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,680
experiments that sort of thing

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,710
development tools which is our like ship

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,380
it tool which we use for deployment our

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:10,750
exception trackers off me which is a way

00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,850
that we can authorize people into our

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,370
github account and Google Apps account

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,230
etc since we're on boarding at such a

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,990
rapid rate and that takes a lot of ops

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,210
time and we have a handful of other

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,940
internal apps as well lunch if I purify

00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:28,360
unicorn all all sorts of things there

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,430
are several hundred applications many of

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,870
those requiring clusters multiple

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:37,590
running pieces etc and so that's kind of

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,910
what we're dealing with to keep running

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,640
real briefly just want to kind of touch

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,430
on who it is that's keeping this running

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,230
and how we're broken up so at a very

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,170
high level again I apologize for the

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,670
wash nature of this image but shopwise

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,300
broken into some high-level departments

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,190
the primary departments with teams

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,100
dealing with keeping the infrastructure

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,460
up and running our data development and

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,430
operations and within those those are

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,890
pretty high level teams so even within

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,870
operations we have what we call tech ops

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,730
which is what you might think of as a

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,550
sort of standard operations engineer

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,770
these days sec ops which is our security

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,710
team which is so tech ops you have about

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:23,590
11 people in security I believe we're up

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,870
to seven people now we have a stack team

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,880
whose goal is to basically build

00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:31,110
infrastructure and make it easier to

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,330
build integrate and scale applications

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,920
internally so this is a team who's

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,870
working on things like in the future

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,420
we'd like to be able to use docker to

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,550
container eyes are applications the

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,440
stack team is working on trying to make

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,300
that happen and then tech ops we would

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,800
probably be the team to you know be

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,170
responsible for rolling that out sort of

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,410
thing we have a performance team who

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,390
deals with Ruby at a low sea level ugly

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,800
memcache internals and all sorts of

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,580
things like that and so they need access

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,990
to the servers and tooling to be able to

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,170
build reports and kind of do their

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,700
investigations then developers and

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,630
others are just kind of like a big group

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,950
mashed in

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,880
because there are lots of sub teams

00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:14,860
within those groups the others would

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,250
include like liaisons from other groups

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,200
who aren't necessarily on an ops team

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,180
themselves but have enough requirements

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,360
and interface with some level of ops

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,650
regularly enough that sort of dedicated

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,700
communication between the two teams and

00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:34,690
among these everybody shares like sre

00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,790
responsibilities so if I think about

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,050
site reliability engineer you know maybe

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,520
somebody who's going to get the page in

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,520
the middle of the night when something

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,830
hits the fan any of these people might

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,380
and part of the goal of that is

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:50,980
eliminating tech ops as a bottleneck

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:54,820
it's also sort of in the DevOps spirit

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,470
of sharing and collaboration and that

00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,290
sort of thing and allowing developers

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:04,300
and other teams and basically the

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:07,450
stakeholders to to own their piece which

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,270
is not to say that that's developers

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,210
taking over ops or that ops is hands-off

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,400
and pushing away I personally believe

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,220
and kind of the mantra on the team is

00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:22,030
that we're there to empower everybody

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,530
else to do their jobs and so as such the

00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:29,530
more power we can put in people's hands

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:31,690
the better so how do we do that because

00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,330
there's a lot of people even among that

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,610
developers and others there are several

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,010
hundred people all with access to our

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,350
cookbooks repository and our ops repo

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:45,430
where we have a number of tools I know

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:47,410
to some people that sounds terrifying to

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:51,190
us it makes a lot of sense and has

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,980
actually worked out really well so

00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,060
before I get into the actual tooling

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,490
want to talk just a little bit about

00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,590
Team Dynamics and I want to talk about

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,500
this before tooling because tooling

00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:05,530
exists to support workflows tools are

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,360
not workflows themselves and there's a

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:11,110
tendency or it's really easy to fall in

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,820
a trap of adopting a tool thinking it's

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,220
you know going to help for something and

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,839
either using it wrong or changing a

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,470
workflow to deal with that or whatever

00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:22,990
and so for us it basically starts with

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,270
the Team Dynamics what we want to

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:30,490
accomplish and then we have some tooling

00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:32,170
to help support that the theme amongst

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,560
all of these things is a communication

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:40,530
basically which is a core tenant of the

00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:43,690
devops idea and so we practice the

00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:45,160
philosophy so to speak of Kaizen which

00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,770
is based off the Toyota Production

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,200
system essentially it boils down to a

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:52,570
continuous improvement philosophy it's

00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,330
pretty interesting you can look it up we

00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,770
use a conv on board to track sort of

00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,200
what everybody's working on where those

00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:01,540
tasks Saturday given time we use a

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,400
concept called lean coffee another thing

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,980
worth looking up and spending some time

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,890
with but essentially it's an agenda lyst

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,290
meeting that we have somewhat regularly

00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,210
where everybody gets together sets the

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,330
agenda at the beginning use some sticky

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,800
notes and sort of democratically vote on

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,450
what are the topics we want or need to

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,120
talk about as a group and then attack

00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,650
those specifically so kind of a

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,370
different way to hold meetings a little

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:30,190
bit we have regular one-on-ones both

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:32,020
with our manager as well as recently

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:36,220
we've started doing team pure

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:38,620
one-on-ones this helps to keep context

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,740
communication things like that among the

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,200
group and sort of keeps people clothes

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:47,530
and things moving quickly we've also

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:51,089
done some team coaching and having some

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:53,530
team conventions things like checklists

00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:55,870
documentation how we perform code

00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:58,120
reviews expectations things like that

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,660
and these are both expectations

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,310
internally within tech ops but also

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,010
expectations across the entire team

00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,949
provides a framework for when developers

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,510
or other teams actually want to you know

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:14,699
work with us do make a change on a

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,699
cookbook or request something of us

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,490
so our conventions that we've adopted on

00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:30,700
the team are a sense of ownership

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,419
meaning both projects you work on

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,250
especially you should have a sense of

00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:39,590
ownership about but the entire

00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:42,350
infrastructure as well move fast we do

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:45,289
not sit on deploys and do regular

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,450
updates or things like that our main

00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:49,669
rails app the Shopify sort of core app

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,279
is deployed anywhere between 20 and 50

00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:54,529
times a day our infrastructure changes

00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:59,570
are deployed on average five to 20 times

00:17:54,529 --> 00:18:00,919
per day and so we move pretty fast

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:04,129
there's a lot of people making a lot of

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:07,309
changes to a lot of areas refactoring

00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:09,350
bringing in new functionality etc but

00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:12,259
while moving fast try not to break

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:16,070
things if you do fail forward ideally if

00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:17,960
we can and if not when we have some

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,149
retrospectives and figure out what went

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,769
wrong no blame had some additional

00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:25,580
monitoring metrics tooling whatever we

00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:27,470
need spreading knowledge and so things

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,799
like the conv on board the multiple

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:33,350
one-on-ones etc documentation various

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,080
things like that again not just across

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:38,360
the ops ops group but across the entire

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,309
company so people kind of know what's up

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,960
or at least where to look or who to

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:44,539
contact if something hits the fan and

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,690
most importantly to have confidence

00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:49,519
because if there's fear especially when

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,850
moving this fast things are more likely

00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:55,639
to break and so ensuring that we have a

00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,710
safety net avoiding blocking writing

00:18:55,639 --> 00:19:03,500
creating too much noise etc as an

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:05,419
important thing so tools we use first

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,899
and foremost this is the ops pod at our

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:11,029
headquarters in Ottawa it's a little

00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:14,120
hard to tell from this picture but to

00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:15,889
side to complete sides are glass so that

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,019
people can kind of see what's going on

00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:19,850
and know when they can come in bug us

00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:23,330
sort of know what's up I also see a

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:26,929
series of large screens which normally

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,639
contain a combination of dashboards for

00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:30,990
things that we care about there's

00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,730
usually a persistent hangout going on

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,309
more than half of the tech ops group is

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:38,100
remote and so let's see my colleague

00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:41,400
Pete up there on one of the screens we

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,410
have a wide angle camera in the room and

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,890
then the persistent hangout going on and

00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,300
so basically because I'm remote I can't

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,910
walk up and tap somebody on the shoulder

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,480
but with this I can say hey Rob can we

00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:56,490
chat for a minute so lots of open space

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,580
lots of room to communicate lots of

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,950
screens and this helps kind of promote

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:05,190
our culture and Team Dynamics it's very

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:08,910
easy to communicate collaborate etc in

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:11,400
the room like this so some tools we use

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:16,170
include email who here uses email

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,370
anybody sorry for you because this is

00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,070
mostly what it looks like it's kind of

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:22,350
hard to read but that's a an inbox full

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,320
of alerts and various things that come

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:27,900
in email our goal is that every email

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,910
that comes in should be actionable we're

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,410
not there yet but we're working on it if

00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:36,120
anybody's got any suggestions on that I

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:38,850
would love to hear it we also use flow

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,920
doc chat you might use campfire HipChat

00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:44,070
IRC slack if it's the new hotness

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,320
whatever you're using but this is a

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,080
pretty key piece for us so whereas

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,630
emails can sit a little more stale this

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,820
sort of a more immediate Avenue for

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,120
communication it's more real-time more

00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,090
dynamic and part of the reason we use

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,370
this is it's almost we use it more as

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,290
like an API integration platform than

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,990
chat almost so some of those areas

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:09,920
arrows are pointing out things like CI

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:12,059
statuses deployment notifications

00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,600
somebody asking Hugh bought who's on

00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:18,870
call exceptions coming in from the App

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,750
etc so we have a number of rooms each

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:24,030
sort of tailored to keep the signal

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,830
signal to noise ratio a little more

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:30,630
tuned for what we're trying to

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:32,130
accomplish I mentioned Hugh bots are he

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,890
bought one of our key boat's name is a

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:37,530
spy in this case this is using the tool

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,970
ship it which I mentioned which is an

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,750
internal tool of ours that we used to

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:44,500
deploy for the developers we have a

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,590
number of other internal tools

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,540
such as off me which I mentioned before

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:53,440
and we've been investing pretty heavily

00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:56,860
in chat ops and so right now we have

00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,070
things like we can enable our ddos

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:02,500
countermeasures and other various things

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,450
we have a huge wish list of things that

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,620
we want to get in there that's something

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:10,630
that interests you come talk to me

00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,180
monitoring and alerting those two tools

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,620
which nobody can pronounce we have five

00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,500
or six different pronunciations across

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:21,220
the team so I'm not even going to try we

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,050
use the second one unfortunately back to

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,700
the email thing that's what my inbox

00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,250
looks like after two days of it chirping

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,340
at me so we're working on it it's not

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:33,100
the best tool but what these do provide

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,960
is immediate feedback in terms of when

00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,270
things are down gives us an area to

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,200
scheduled downtime let people know ahead

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:42,280
of time kind of what's going to be

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,750
happening and while we'd like to build

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,430
some more chat ops tooling for example

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,320
around this to eliminate the pain of the

00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,290
horrible dashboard and lots of other

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,580
awful aspects of using it it's pretty

00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:55,720
critical tool at the moment in our

00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:58,150
infrastructure to know what's up we also

00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,880
you splunk pretty extensively I don't

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:03,640
know if anybody's used splunk common

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,210
conception is that it's for dumping logs

00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,970
to which it is we use splunk very

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,190
heavily we are current licenses at a

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,710
terabyte a day and feels like every

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,930
month we're bumping that up but we use

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,480
splunk for way more than logs we have a

00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:23,920
lot of custom dashboards alerting

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:26,200
notification and email unfortunately

00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,690
communications that come in to help us

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,300
support our workflows and so these are

00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,970
things like log anomalies which might

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,440
make sense payment gateway errors but

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,410
also things to help support our workflow

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,290
so if a chef client hasn't checked in

00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,850
for some period of time on the server or

00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,070
there's an environmental change our

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:47,710
reader writer VIPs on one of our

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,230
clusters changed things like that this

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,810
is a way to alert us and and handle the

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,300
communication we also have a second

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,760
instance for our card server environment

00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,590
which I mentioned before

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,780
stats D and graphite were mentioned

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,570
before we use those pretty extensively

00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,400
we also use data dog as a service we're

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,170
using both at the moment because we have

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,690
some custom dashboards and tooling and

00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:13,240
things that still depend on our local

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,530
graphite instance but data dog has been

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,470
pretty great if anybody is looking at

00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,900
that very base level that's kind of like

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,030
a hosted stats d but there's an event

00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,890
stream that people can sort of

00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:26,140
collaborate around and it's given us a

00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,780
way to keep context a little closer when

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,680
an event does occur to communicate their

00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,970
verses in flow dock or over email where

00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:38,980
there's coordination points to go back

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:40,210
and forth also a stats D and graphite

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,360
are a little painful for making your own

00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:45,340
custom dashboards or can be data dog has

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,740
been a real win sort of for the rest of

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,080
the team and the rest of the company in

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,400
a lot of regards we've been using it for

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,210
a little over two months now maybe and

00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,520
actually did a little slightly longer

00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,100
than that but we have over 120 custom

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,370
dashboards at the moment pretty much

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:06,190
every team across the company has a KPI

00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:09,970
dashboard or several that they monitor

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:12,760
and keeping the state of the

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,620
infrastructure the company health etc

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,460
all of the various things that we track

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:20,350
in here has been pretty crucial and I

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:23,770
mentioned we have some custom tooling as

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:27,280
well this is Stanley one of our internal

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:29,410
dashboard tools again pretty much every

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,390
team has their own sort of KPIs and

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:33,760
things they monitor we also have

00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,260
dashboards and lobby for social things

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,790
and things that might interest visitors

00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:41,800
and dashboards all around the office so

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:47,530
the the information flow keeping things

00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:52,300
flowing is is pretty critical and all of

00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:54,910
these things are managed by a chef and

00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,270
this is roughly at the moment sort of

00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,240
our chef workflow pipeline if you will

00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:03,160
we've recently started using vagrant

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,200
transitioning from boxin vagrant has

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,600
been a pretty big win the stack team I

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,080
mentioned before spent quite a bit of

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,169
time on that excuse me that's Nate

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,320
our developers to a have an environment

00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:18,669
that's much more like production and be

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,169
ease the transition of getting them

00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:21,970
working on their own chef cookbooks and

00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:24,970
things like that as well gives them a

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:27,549
local place to get their hands on things

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,730
feel free to break it it has questions

00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:32,710
various things like that and really

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:35,169
shorten the lifespan of going through

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:38,250
there we have an internal tool called

00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:40,570
cooker which I'll talk about in a second

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,450
vagrant and cooker together have

00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:45,220
basically eliminated the need for

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,659
development environments for us so in

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,580
addition to staging a lot of companies

00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:50,260
or a lot of groups will have sort of dev

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,710
instances in the cloud where they can

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,510
collaborate or share this that

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,970
combination is pretty much eliminated

00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,799
the need for that for us our staging

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,630
environment pretty closely mirrors

00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,809
production and that's where we'll do

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,519
sort of acceptance testing run our run

00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:07,600
migrations and things like that to see

00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,649
how long they're going to take and what

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,320
sort of impact it will have on the

00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:14,549
production system before we go live and

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,549
production is pretty self-explanatory

00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:22,029
cooker cooker cooker sits in front of

00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:25,029
our chef server and pretty much manages

00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:27,070
all aspects of our chef integration and

00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:30,250
workflow for us does that in three

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:33,639
primary ways one is by using

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:36,850
environments and every time a branch is

00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:39,309
pushed to github or to whatever get

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,519
environment a new cooker environment is

00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:45,039
created that mirrors that branch name

00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:48,730
things like data bags rolls cookbook

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,200
versions will be named spaced so that

00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,159
they're isolated from the rest of the

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,649
environment while things are actually

00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:56,409
being worked on when a branch gets

00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:59,260
merged or deleted cooker handles

00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:00,940
cleaning all of that up it will if any

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,159
nodes have manually been switched

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,799
environments cooker will switch them

00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:10,240
back remove the namespace trolls data

00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:13,389
bags etc things like that data bags

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,610
which we rely on pretty heavily with

00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:18,309
cooker sitting in front cooker actually

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,770
handles sort of our encrypted values and

00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:23,020
our data bag workflow so in our git

00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,519
repository and locally all of our data

00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,099
bags are available in crypt

00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,349
did we use our standard knife data bag

00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:31,149
edit those sort of commands but cooker

00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:33,190
transparently sits in front intercepts

00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:35,999
things handles encryption and other

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:39,489
various things for us and it also

00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:42,669
provides a testing platform and so when

00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:44,679
we push to github it sits kind of like

00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:46,659
our CI status and will tell us things

00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,209
like you're trying to push a cookbook

00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:51,219
where whose version is frozen or any

00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:54,669
number of various things that would fill

00:28:51,219 --> 00:28:56,649
the build so to speak right now that

00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:58,869
testing support is pretty basic but in

00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:01,419
the future ideally that would be running

00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:04,749
things like food critic chef spec test

00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:09,849
kitchen etc to provide sort of more

00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:11,139
detail than better feedback as we go I'm

00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:13,059
running out of time so I'm going to go

00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:14,709
through a little bit but here are some

00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:16,839
examples of our cooker integration with

00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:19,059
flow doc kind of keeping everybody in

00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:21,099
the loop as to what's going on I can see

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,570
cooker failed to build because of a

00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:27,690
frozen cookbook version that somebody

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:31,119
pushed cooker uploading a version etc

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:34,959
also here's an example of you know

00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:37,829
master going up and so changing notes

00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:41,859
data bags environments etc as required

00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:43,450
it's a cleanup example again on the

00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:45,879
communication front cooker also helps us

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,499
directly on github as well so we have a

00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:48,639
lot of things going on at any given time

00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,589
a lot of people working on a lot of

00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:52,899
different pieces and sometimes start

00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:55,209
something and get get pulled away from

00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:57,190
that cooker will hopefully remind us

00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:59,559
that hey you've got some a note or some

00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,299
nodes that are a little old probably get

00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,539
those caught up and or get rid of your

00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:06,940
branch so this is sort of using our team

00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:08,619
dynamics to work with our tooling to

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,729
help reinforce the things that we want

00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:17,440
which are move fast don't break things

00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:19,209
and sort of keep it fresh the other

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,619
aspect of cooker that we use a lot of

00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:26,859
knife plugins so we use the command line

00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:29,229
a lot we use knife the way a lot of

00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:30,909
people might use rake with rails it

00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:34,179
wraps a lot of tools for us you can see

00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:36,789
some examples of things that that we use

00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:37,870
knife plugins for up here there are

00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:39,430
quite a bit more

00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,620
and we'll probably use more and more of

00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:46,600
them but the command line is pretty

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:48,160
powerful thing should use it so as I've

00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,770
got about 30 seconds left I just want to

00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,870
point out this is the tech ops team at

00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,600
the moment at Shopify you could be in

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,760
that square right there that's missing

00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,880
and I just want to thank the Shopify

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,650
team because technology is one thing you

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,780
can find interesting technology anywhere

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:07,360
but a compelling work environment is a

00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,850
little harder to find and shop flies got

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,270
both in case i missed anybody that's the

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:15,010
entire Shopify team at the moment want

00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:17,110
to thank all of you very much for your

00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:20,559
time and attention and I will take

00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:22,840
questions comments concerns heckles well

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,980
I've got a minute or so comments no

00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,980
thank you all very much

00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,560
