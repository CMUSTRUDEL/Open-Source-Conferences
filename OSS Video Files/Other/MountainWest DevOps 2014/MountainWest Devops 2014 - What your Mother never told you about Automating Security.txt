Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: MountainWest DevOps 2014
Description: 
	Your mother might be cooler than mine, but security is hard work. Heavily automated environments like "the cloud" bring both new strategies and new challenges. We'll work through some real-life problems and solutions; topics maybe your mom forgot to mention. Off-topic topics will include: controlling and tracking network access; 2-factor authentication and you; security-minded logging and metrics, and the importance of using protection for data at rest. There will be code.
