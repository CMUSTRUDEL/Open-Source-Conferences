Description: 
	By Thomas Hatch

SaltStack does a lot of stuff, mostly focusing on infrastructure automation, configuration management and cloud orchestration. Quite simply, our software helps automate DevOps tasks for speed and scale on the Internet assembly line. But there's much more, so Tom will provide a quick overview of the SaltStack platform and share a few things you probably don't know about how SaltStack is used in DevOps organizations today. Tom's talk will highlight the need for speed and scale in DevOps, put an end to an age-old holy war in configuration management, talk about why we need more lightweight cloud control, outline the benefits of automation glue for all the infrastructure things, and show how test automation can be easier and faster combining Salt, Jenkins, Docker and Git.
