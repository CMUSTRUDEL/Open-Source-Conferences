Title: MountainWest Devops 2014 - "DevOps" in a Post-DevOps World by Paul Reed
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: MountainWest DevOps 2014
Description: 
	Has "DevOps" jumped the shark?
Some say yes; others say 2014 will be the year DevOps dons its Fonz-esque leather jacket. Whichever you believe, the marketing feeding frenzy has begun and the dilution of the "DevOps" concept to include everything (and simultaneously mean nothing) is palpable.
But DevOps has a dirty secret: many of its core tenets are ancient computer history: configuration management, version control, automated builds, and metrics-driven decision making: all old news. So what caused these long-known best practices to congeal and pop together, becoming part of the industry consciousness? And why have some been so successful at implementing it in their organizations while others continue to struggle?
This talk deconstructs the meta-elements of DevOps that made it resonate so strongly with so many and allowed those familiar DevOps poster children—Netflix, Etsy, and others—to deploy the methodology with such success in their businesses. We'll go beyond DevOps' classical CAMS (culture, automation, metrics, and sharing) definition to discover what exactly what made DevOps relevant, and what about it is so timeless and foundational that it will make whatever-follows-DevOps relevant, too.

alright the hardest lot of the day so we

00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:39,030
started today talking about tools and we

00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,200
had some culture talks and for the last

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,739
of the day I want to talk a little bit

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,879
about the future so this is DevOps in a

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,040
post DevOps world so Who am I I'm Paul

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,579
Reed I go by the silver build engineer

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,989
Twitter silver build Inge I 15 years

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,960
experience as a build release engineer

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,300
so I come from the more the ops side of

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,070
the house I know whether people asking

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,240
are there other opps few all their other

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,460
build engineers here probably not I've

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,320
been a DevOps consultant for the last

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,710
few of those years we'll laugh about

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,180
that in a moment and as you can see if

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,560
you're curious about that where the

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,869
nickname came from you can actually ask

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,330
me for at the bar for the story it's

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,039
kind of funny if my voice sounds a

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,080
little familiar we have a podcast called

00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:27,210
the ship show those are my coasts

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,670
they're great you can check us out at

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:35,760
ship show at does ship show calm so in

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,130
conversations with friends and

00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,920
colleagues at conferences I've started

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:46,110
hearing some murmuring about has DevOps

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,750
jumped the shark which may seem like an

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,110
odd question to ask especially after we

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,909
everything we've talked about today so I

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,920
mean obviously DevOps is going

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,200
gangbusters if you search Google for

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,229
DevOps you're going to get 16 million

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,229
hits you've got your tools up there you

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,170
know your DevOps in a box all of these

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:11,009
things and which might lead you to think

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:18,930
it's about the tools so you obviously

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:22,079
download devops easy as that make sure

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,760
your tool is developed by devops from

00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,989
dev ops 2 devops i don't know what

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,690
that's supposed to mean is that like

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:30,660
some kind of inception reference or

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,370
something i did want to know if one of

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,260
the vendors and i won't tell you which

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,879
one on the page

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,500
talks about their DevOps tool and if you

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,849
click on the link and search for the

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,909
phrase DevOps and there was in the

00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:46,500
resulting page you don't get anything so

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:47,670
it's like some weirdness there okay so

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,049
maybe it's not about the tools maybe

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,450
it's about the company culture you can

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:55,980
search DevOps and jobs listings you'll

00:02:51,450 --> 00:03:00,049
see there's 4499 exactly devops jobs

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:03,180
apparently if you're not sure you can

00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:05,579
get devops certified the complete

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:10,010
certification kit so on Amazon three

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:17,340
hundred dollars because we all know that

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:18,750
tomorrow's jobs our DevOps jobs if

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,940
you're having trouble you want to make

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,569
sure you get your terminology right so

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,310
if you're looking for ops dev engineers

00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:28,769
you're going to have not as many search

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,010
results you'd be wondering what where

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,959
the crowd is and of course if you're

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,349
having problem with your tooling maybe

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,060
your tool is to static your your dev ops

00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:44,280
2 list to static you want a dynamic

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:46,349
DevOps tool um and then you know so

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,599
recruiters are loving this right and and

00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:50,280
I got this ping from a recruiter and he

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,750
said the definition of DevOps is an

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,250
elusive one indeed and I'm like great

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,480
the recruiters gonna they're going to

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,769
help me help me understand what's going

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,000
on here but anyways one of our clients

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:06,510
at downtown San Francisco blah blah blah

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,340
and you're like okay maybe not uh

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,900
indella ops is like one of the fastest

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,190
growing segments of the entire economy

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,010
apparently if you search for DevOps

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,780
you'll get a hit in length this linkedin

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,139
obviously for an executive chef for the

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,359
ucsf medical center I've heard in of

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:25,860
infrastructure as code but I've never

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:30,240
heard of food as code and then of course

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,889
if you go to a DevOps info which patrick

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,630
dubois she registered used to have a lot

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:38,130
of info there it's now a bed and

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:41,669
breakfast in Belgium I think so we have

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,469
our own bed and breakfast now sometimes

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,330
I just feel like I can't like I'm the

00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:47,580
kid in that picture I can't I can't even

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,699
I can't DevOps anymore I just

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,960
can't do it when I see stuff like that

00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,939
and in all seriousness I mean a lot of

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,710
companies is trying to help their

00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,810
customers understand and embrace the

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,120
whole DevOps movement and react they're

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,099
reacting and the shift in the market to

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,030
the shift in the marketplace and I

00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:07,469
understand that I so it's you know I and

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,080
that's good right because it bring more

00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:12,060
people into the fold but sometimes I

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,360
just see something and it just makes me

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:19,710
wonder like are we really are we jumping

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,110
the shark here so before we can actually

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,520
discuss have we jumped the shark are we

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,629
jumping the shark it's it's good have a

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,150
working definition we're going to talk

00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:30,180
about DevOps of what DevOps is and i saw

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,280
it i think in bridges presentation john

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,370
willis quite elegantly i think actually

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,889
defined it as cams culture automation

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,050
metrics and sharing if you're unfamiliar

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:45,029
with the post you can read it there it's

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,919
actually 2010 there's no post but here's

00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:50,129
what I never really understood we had

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:53,129
all of these things for a long time I

00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:54,930
mean the mythical man month and death

00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:58,069
march i mean the mythical man month was

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,740
published in 1975 and again in 1995

00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:05,599
Death March 1997 20 years of pearl books

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:10,409
in automation if you don't like she'll

00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:12,900
CES man open source felons CPS CF engine

00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:17,039
was released in late late nineties

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:21,060
anyone remember mr TG yeah mr t GE

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,879
awesome graph everything um and then on

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,979
the sharing site we had the GPL we had

00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,779
used next we had lugs Linux even

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:31,469
remember linux users groups people do

00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:33,180
that so what made devops pop what it

00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:37,430
mean made it resonate with everyone in

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,430
like the last five years three years

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,960
well to look at that i think it's useful

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:46,529
to take the derivative and if you don't

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,509
like calculus which is me another way to

00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:51,719
say it is take a look at and made a look

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:54,779
at why the devops pop in the way that it

00:06:51,719 --> 00:07:01,030
did so i submit to you that if we solve

00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:05,240
this equation we get this did

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:07,789
cam's bids which stands for value

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,569
realignment individuality don't be an

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:14,500
 and self-awareness so let's talk

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:17,780
about what these four things mean so

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,509
value realignment what we're time not

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,069
talking about the Bitcoin crash although

00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,889
I do you think that's an interesting

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:28,940
graph um what we really talking about is

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:31,310
looking at value and it's generation and

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,080
including things that detract from that

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,490
value so in the example we've heard a

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,960
number of times where you've got

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,610
developers installing things differently

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,610
I mean that that's just a waste of work

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,280
and time ultimately and that detract

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,229
from value and it includes everyone and

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,449
their activity activities within the

00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:49,970
organization in that particular

00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,770
calculation and then part of that too is

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,719
mapping its flow within the organization

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:57,409
and yo y'all hear that referred to often

00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:59,449
is the value stream so it may seem like

00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:01,009
business business major e stuff but the

00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:04,460
quintessential example that we always

00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:06,889
hear of of a dev developers throwing

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,770
stuff over the wall to ops that's really

00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:11,479
uh tracking the value and the value

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,909
that's lost in doing that and the

00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:16,250
developers go home and ob's has to deal

00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:18,979
with with that mess and getting it

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,539
working and that lost value that they're

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,520
having to repeat so much of that work

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:25,340
it's really just looking at the value

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:29,090
and looking at how it's flowing through

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,529
that organization it's also

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,959
acknowledgement that this sort of

00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:35,570
attitude does not work this the

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,270
developer is King attitude and I know

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,190
there are a lot of developers here but

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,570
you know this talk about ascending to

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,849
the throne and getting the royal

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,450
treatment and all of that this is the

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:48,860
wrong attitude and we've realized this

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,110
because know how that matter how good

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,839
your software is or how compelling your

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,670
software is if you don't have someone

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,380
responsible for operating it or if you

00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,360
still ship it someone's responsible

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,270
building and releasing it it does not

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:08,480
matter anyone remember the Amazon

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:11,209
outages so this resonates with everyone

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,680
who isn't a developer bringing up the

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,480
point that it's not just developers

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,220
anymore that

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,240
creators of value lots of people are

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:22,420
involved in that process and everyone is

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,779
responsible for it all right next up

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,880
individuality so I do not mean that ever

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:29,910
by this I don't mean that everyone is a

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,779
unique snowflake even though we all are

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:36,610
what I actually mean is in develop

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,529
individuality in this context so this is

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,810
something called the Canon framework

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,980
it's it's a Welsh word so it's spelt

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,180
kind of weird and it's hard to pronounce

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:48,750
at least for me I was mess it up but

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:53,019
it's a sense making framework and it's

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:55,660
basically a way to look at a situation

00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,220
before you have when you just have data

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,269
and you can't put it into categories

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:03,760
because you don't really know what those

00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,980
categories would be so I want to ask a

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,839
question who here would describe their

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,740
work or their software that they're

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:15,250
working on writing as simple would

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:18,790
anyone I see one person going like this

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:22,500
so I'm going to say no it's sort of

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:25,839
simple the reason i ask that is because

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,899
that means that we all operate in this

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,519
complex and complicated space and the

00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,529
reason that i point that out is because

00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,050
if you're in this complicated and

00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:38,230
complex space the decision-making that

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:44,079
you make fall under good practice not

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:46,930
best practice and in fact best practices

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,250
are legitimate in the simple domain but

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,829
they're illegitimate and all of the

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,569
others and in fact i'm the guy who came

00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:55,060
up with this he said forcing best

00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,910
practice on people when good practices

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,490
what's called for well and i quote him

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,949
piss people off because and caused them

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,800
to avoid best practices entirely and

00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:08,170
I've actually been trying to change the

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,930
language my language with clients

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,790
because we're so tied to this idea of

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,889
best practices and even with developers

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:20,860
we don't call it that fact the next

00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:25,019
slide is is hacker news right the you're

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,259
doing it wrong and it's the idea that

00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,790
when we

00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:30,879
working in complicated and complex

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,470
systems there is no best practice best

00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,720
is superlative it means there's one

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,449
there may be there are certainly bad

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,069
practice but there we're working in

00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:42,100
space where there are good practices

00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:44,619
there are multiple reasonable solutions

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,479
today outcome based on data we generally

00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:48,249
don't have which is why I hacker news

00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:50,529
threads can be so infuriating to read

00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,720
because most of the time these people

00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,699
don't have the data that that we might

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,839
have when we ask a question in a forum

00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:02,139
and get this you're doing it wrong next

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,089
up don't be an this is a book

00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:08,229
called the no rule who's heard

00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:10,559
of this book so man's who's read it so

00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:13,149
hands ok good um this was written by a

00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,399
researcher at Stanford and I pardon the

00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,169
language but apparently it's a technical

00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,589
organizational dynamics research term

00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:22,839
now he actually goes at some length into

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,299
the book talking about why he didn't why

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,100
he felt it was important to use the word

00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:29,139
 and he said you know if we

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,649
watered down to say the note jerks rule

00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:38,410
or the no negative nancy rule it takes

00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:41,859
away from the impact that the discussion

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:45,339
has about what these people do to other

00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:47,019
people and how those people feel so he

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,249
uses that word throughout the book I was

00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,459
trying to get an account of how many

00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:55,139
times he uses the word in the book this

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:59,079
is not being an the old UNIX

00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:01,749
neckbeard from Dilbert um he's very

00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:04,720
specific about an arrow in his

00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:08,379
definition of that um and and that's

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,980
important so I this may be hard to read

00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:14,799
but he give he provides two tests one of

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,329
them is after talking to the alleged or

00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,949
test one is after talking to the alleged

00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:21,159
 does the target feel oppressed

00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:23,529
humiliated de-energized or belittled by

00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,269
the person and in particular does the

00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:28,779
target feel worse about him or herself

00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:31,089
and test two is does the alleged

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:33,429
aim his or her venom at people who are

00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:36,879
less powerful rather than those who are

00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:38,739
more powerful if your organization

00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,699
allows this you should buy this book and

00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:46,480
give it to

00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:48,609
someone upstairs this is not cheap there

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,679
are some interesting quotations he goes

00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:52,749
into more detail but there couple I

00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:56,199
wanted to bring up on there talking

00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:57,549
about a CEO who had personally

00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:00,929
criticized lots of the employees and

00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:04,949
they said that the middle management

00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:07,569
revealed of course anonymously that that

00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:09,839
behavior robbed the company of talent it

00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:12,639
needed to maintain quality operations

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,779
one set of researchers tried to miss

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,239
estimate the TCA total cost of

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:21,699
for one person at a company for one year

00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:24,389
the bill came out to 160 thousand

00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:27,759
dollars they factored in all of the

00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:30,489
legal fees all of hrs time dealing with

00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,519
this all the CEOs like HR talking to the

00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:40,600
management all of those people's time

00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:42,699
and and so this is costs real money now

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,189
we all have bad days the book makes the

00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:46,749
distinction between a temporary

00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:50,319
and certified which apparently

00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:52,299
are technical terms we've I said we've

00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:54,220
all probably been temporary at

00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:56,889
one point or another we'll talk more

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,919
about that in a sec and finally a

00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:01,869
self-awareness I don't mean this in the

00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,749
clinical sense of the word where you

00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:06,129
know your dog barks at the mirror

00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:12,579
because in that sense we are all

00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:14,529
self-aware I mean it in this sense how

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,419
many engineering meetings has hangar

00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,489
ruined right you get an engineering

00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:20,799
meeting right before lunch and then

00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:22,239
around 11 action baby right now right

00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:27,939
you know like I want to go have dinner

00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:31,089
um so it took me that in into my 20s to

00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:34,029
realize like I kept being an

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,980
actually the people and friends in the

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:37,929
mornings it was cuz while I grab a cup

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,209
of coffee and go to work because I was

00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:43,749
in a rush and took me a while to realize

00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:46,199
there's a reason for that um oftentimes

00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:49,509
one way that I like to think about

00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:52,290
self-awareness is a watchdog timer any

00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:53,970
like old hardware hackers

00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,100
you know Cisco routers you to have this

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,199
little hardware thing in them the OS

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,110
would poke it and if the OS ever hung

00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,880
then the hardware timer would reset it

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,100
right and so there's sort of list

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,680
background thing that's sort of checking

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,750
to see what's going on we had the

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,699
Mountain West j/s before us it's like

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,850
that dialogue that comes up it's like

00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:16,470
you calm / being an jayus is

00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:21,470
taking too long would you like to

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:24,060
continue yes or no um i actually have

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,160
started like thinking about it as

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,959
there's like this little voice slow

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,250
voice back here going you're being an

00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:34,350
 you need to stop it a couple of

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,880
this you know so hangers kind of it you

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,579
know an interesting one it took me a

00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,069
while I realized that but these they're

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,449
they're actually real stories here and

00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:44,430
this happens to us more often than I

00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:48,300
think a lot of us realize certainly for

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,850
me have you ever had a really passionate

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,130
technical argument with someone and then

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:56,209
you realized after it was over you're

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:59,670
like I didn't really care that much um

00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:01,350
when I was in my first job I had a

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,459
really really good friend and he was

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,040
just out of school and I'd been working

00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,510
there for a couple years I said hey can

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,790
work can work with a company with me and

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,620
so and so we was there for summer as an

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,030
intern and we hung out all the time and

00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:16,140
you know we playing video games and

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,819
stuff and we had a fight one night so we

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,339
left we were angry at each other and not

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,110
whole thing and the next day we had a

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,199
build team meeting and we were talking

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:28,350
about third-party source management

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,470
which is an important topic but not the

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:34,130
most exciting topic and so we're there

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,290
with the entire building he and I and we

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,090
start arguing with each other and what's

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,880
funny is we're having the same argument

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,320
with same energy about the argument that

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,330
we had last night we drug it into the

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,460
meaning but all couched in terms about

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:51,419
patch management and third-party

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:54,120
open-source licenses and the media ended

00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,070
people left and my mentor stayed back

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,750
with me knee and it was like both you

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,270
guys both really care about this third

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,610
party source stuff and in the meeting

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,400
there was nothing here going hey you're

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:11,730
being a jerk stop it

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:13,110
um so this is being realized in the

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,350
industry this was an article recently

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,520
empathy as a core engineering value is a

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,820
core engineering value and there's a

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,760
link so post discussing that this kind

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,310
of hearts back to don't be an

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,750
but it's hard to be empathetic when

00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:31,140
you're sort of unclear on what's going

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,750
on within yourself when you're kind of

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,540
like I'm I'm acting a way that I don't

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,660
normally usually act and your voice is

00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:44,580
like what's going on and you can't

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:47,130
really answer it so that's vids so let's

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:50,820
talk about how does this fit we define

00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:53,280
DevOps is culture automation sharing

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:57,120
metrics I got this triangles backwards

00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,200
but that's okay well so if you actually

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,750
categorize these I mean obviously

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,210
putting CDs into trays on thousands of

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,130
servers detracts from value so

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:12,630
automation clearly goes in the value

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:14,670
column and and so it also when we look

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,590
at automation it talks about like it's

00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,760
optimizing how we actually deliver bits

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,350
which is what continuous delivery

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,300
pipelines are actually all about that

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,200
 whole purpose is optimizing that

00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,660
process sharing obviously internally

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,300
addressing how stuff goes but flows

00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,700
between Devon ops and those teams and

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:36,120
how that stuff works clearly that's part

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,580
of that individuality metris allows us

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,170
to get the data that we need to be able

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,430
to react to complex and complicated

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:46,890
systems because we can't rely on best

00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:49,110
practices merely good ones so sharing

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,310
also becomes critical in that because we

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,380
need to be able to communicate about

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:55,470
what the possible solution good

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,610
practices solutions are and then

00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,080
obviously on they don't be an

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,740
and self-awareness culture is a huge

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,210
factor in that if you read the Phoenix

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,760
project to talk about the first way

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,990
second way and third way of DevOps if

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,050
you haven't read the Phoenix project you

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:13,260
should go read the Phoenix project so if

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:18,960
we stick that into the model systems

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:21,059
thinking is necessary to map value

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,640
um optimizing feedback loops that's the

00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:29,299
second way same sort of thing that's

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:32,880
about looking at the value stream in

00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:34,620
individuality to be able in complicated

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,539
systems the model for looking on that

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,159
stuff is sense analyze respond so we

00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:41,399
actually have to amplify the feedback

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,770
loops which is the second way and then

00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:44,669
again of course a learning organization

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,529
understands that it's systems are

00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:47,880
complex and complicated so there isn't

00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:49,409
an obvious solution they're not going to

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,539
try to shoehorn a best practice because

00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:52,950
they know that's not going to work the

00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,649
third way also talks a lot about fault

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:59,960
injection which you get into with

00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:59,960
complicated and emergent systems

00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:06,000
obviously for don't be an if you

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,610
the third way talks about becoming a

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,760
learning culture which says it's okay to

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,799
fail and making that not something that

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,230
you can be blamed for fired for so

00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:20,010
obviously that's part of though don't be

00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,990
an and and then of course for

00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:25,200
organizations we talked about

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,370
self-awareness at the organizational

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,380
level like what does that actually mean

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:33,029
well it turns out but that's actually

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:36,480
systems thinking because it's an example

00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:38,490
of where you've got you know dev maybe

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,990
dev says oh I need to change the version

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,250
of a boon to who are using and they

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,950
don't tell ops that until they try to

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,840
deploy it fails right so it's one of

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,760
those who develop the developer says oh

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,740
I'm going to change the version of the

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:56,070
JDK there's something back there going

00:21:49,740 --> 00:22:02,340
and I should tell those guys it turns

00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:04,049
out that you can map this stuff to do so

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,570
this is the five values of extreme

00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:09,510
programming communication simplicity

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:13,470
feedback respect courage they map into

00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,940
this too so communication obviously its

00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,279
impact on the value stream is pretty

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,630
obvious simplicity again optimizing the

00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,750
value stream so now building stuff that

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,970
we're not going to use feedback is

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,289
basically an example of sharing so

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:30,210
you've got that in there I actually

00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:32,340
didn't put feedback into individuality

00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,049
but again it's an example

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,880
in the complex space you probe since

00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,020
respond so that's where the feedback is

00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,850
relevant because you're probing

00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,929
something and then you need to sense how

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:44,549
it responds and then so you can respond

00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:46,559
either don't be an respect

00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,120
obviously that's pretty obvious courage

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,470
you need that to actually stand up to

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,409
people who are doing that in your

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:58,620
environment and what's interesting is

00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:59,789
under the self-awareness part Kent Beck

00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,190
actually at a quote where he's like

00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:04,830
optimism optimism is an occupational

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,690
hazard of programming feedback is the

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,809
treatment so it's one of those things I

00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:11,850
mean we've all done this where it's like

00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:13,500
we all sit them in the room and we say

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,649
this is totally going to ship on spec

00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,750
and on time and in the background our

00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:21,059
self aware just going not going to

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,720
happen and so that's extreme program

00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:27,809
that's how it tries to solve these areas

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,549
you can take a jal's for values people

00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:31,620
over tools in process working software

00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:33,020
over documentation customer

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,640
collaboration over contract negotiation

00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:39,840
responding to change over following a

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,149
plan you can map them in on the value

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,020
stream valuing actually working software

00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:48,960
over right only wiki's documentation

00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,600
that nobody reads again valuing

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,970
individuals over process because there's

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,070
you know maybe multiple good solutions

00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,270
and responding to change over following

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,320
a plan because again we're talking about

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:03,690
complex complicated systems in the don't

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:09,059
be an you know I didn't put it

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:10,350
on there but the valuing customer

00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,779
interactions over contract negotiation

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,640
because some people think a contract is

00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:16,890
an excuse to be an but so you

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,590
could put that in there to the SD stands

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,909
for scrum and so obviously if you're

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,830
going to be aware of the system around

00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,360
you scrum is a way to actually let teams

00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,250
communicate and let people by just

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,049
standing there absorb what's happening

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:32,580
with the system around them so there's a

00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:34,110
bit of a self-awareness with that and we

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,820
all had this right where we're talking

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,890
about you know the solves the I said

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,779
this was two story points and again the

00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:43,190
self-awareness is like not to story

00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,190
points or like 12

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:50,380
and you can actually do it with I

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,810
promise this last one you do with Lee

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,550
nighty where they talk about value

00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:57,190
streams and value stream mapping and

00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,540
flow and pull demand systems obviously

00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,520
the value stream value stream mapping

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:04,480
stuff it's clearly in the value

00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,250
realignment space flow causes people to

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,180
shift away from best practices to just

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,760
in time for what the organization

00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,980
actually needs and then of course flow

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,130
relates to being aware the systems are

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,110
the organization's own limitations and

00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:21,160
so when pulled amana tries to address

00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:23,440
those things so if we so that got a

00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,590
little crazy at the end that oval graph

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,080
with all those little dots and stuff but

00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:31,510
trying to answer the question what's the

00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,020
derivative of DevOps and I think the

00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:36,880
answer is vids it turns out it's the

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,200
same it's also the derivative XP and

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:47,940
agile and scrum and lean IT so has

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,940
DevOps jumped the shark I don't know

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:54,240
what's next so you're a lot of talk

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:57,610
about this concept of flow or ops flow

00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:01,390
is it like sales finance build dev up

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,700
dev QA ops all smushed together is it

00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:06,760
Enterprise DevOps the next generation is

00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:12,300
it magical unicorns and rainbows working

00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,300
together develop software I don't know

00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,590
what I do know is that whatever it is

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:20,320
it's highly unlikely to involve these

00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:23,800
four things value realignment

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,900
individuality don't be an self

00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,500
and self awareness and systems thinking

00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:32,490
and if we all strive towards getting

00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,200
good at these in ourselves and in our

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,810
companies will build better software

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,150
will operate our sister our services

00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:43,210
more adeptly will be better to each

00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:48,030
other and that's an industry I want to

00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:48,030
live in and I hope you do too thanks

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,260
