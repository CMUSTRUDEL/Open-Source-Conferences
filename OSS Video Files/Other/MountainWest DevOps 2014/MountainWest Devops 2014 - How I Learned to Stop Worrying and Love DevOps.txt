Title: MountainWest Devops 2014 - How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love DevOps
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: MountainWest DevOps 2014
Description: 
	By  Bridget Kromhout

I was a college-student BOFH, an ISP sysadmin, and an academic IT manager. If I wanted a curmudgeonly sysadmin, I could just look in a mirror. Most developers were unlikely to be granted root on any systems whatsoever, and servers were carefully hand-whittled works of art. You know, The Way Things Were.
Moving to a role doing operations at a developer-centric startup was both a culture shock and a great learning experience. I'll discuss what worked for me (and what was challenging!) in terms of my transition to a DevOps practice. Spoiler alert: change is scary, but awesome developers on the team make it much easier for an old-school sysadmin to be assimilated into the DevOps of Borg.kromh

okay so obviously i'm not an

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,420
audio-visual professional my boyfriend

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,450
actually is so if you watching the live

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,250
stream hunt back from Minnesota I'm not

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,900
trying to do any live demos that require

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,030
the internet I know that's the number

00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,520
one rule of conference Wi-Fi is always

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,190
going to be a problem so my name is

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,230
Bridget creme how I do operations for a

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,750
small social commerce startup in

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:56,130
minneapolis called eighth bridge I have

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,200
a t-shirt and today I'm going to talk

00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,270
about that stuff that Mitchell alluded

00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,100
to earlier when he started us off saying

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,750
culture is important but he's going to

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,530
focus on the tools well I'm gonna talk a

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,660
little bit about the culture and to give

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,720
you an idea of why I am the right person

00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,119
to talk to you about this I've been

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,740
assisted in for a long time like long

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,970
enough that I poured one on the curb for

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,430
you know son was for 13 and some of the

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:28,290
some of you have nostalgia there um and

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,869
I didn't I don't think I started out

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,150
being this you know horrible rigid

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,710
bureaucrat right I mean I started out

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,330
thinking hey I in one of my earlier

00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,640
lives one of my earlier incarnations I

00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,619
worked for a giant telco which shall

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,960
remain nameless because of what I'm

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,299
about to tell you so they had a 42-page

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,520
change management process form that we

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,330
were supposed to fill out if as this

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,330
admin's we wanted to do anything but if

00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,950
it was an emergency then we could just

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,860
do whatever we wanted and then just fill

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,640
out an emergency form later um one guess

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,380
as to how many emergencies there were so

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,079
it's not that I was always all about

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,470
process and bureaucracy but for some

00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:15,540
reason over the years as a sysadmin I

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,340
started seeing know a lot mostly to

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,590
developers how many developers are there

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,049
in this room yeah how many of you have

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,959
ever had assisted minccino to you yeah

00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:26,489
so and the ones who haven't you probably

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,230
just don't have any assistance people at

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:33,510
your organization right and so that was

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,180
not actually the best way to relate to

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,269
developers

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:41,739
on my previous gig before the startup

00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:44,859
that I'm at now I I was at an academic

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,540
research institute for seven years and I

00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:48,489
ran a group of sustenance and developers

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,230
but there were these other developers in

00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,769
the other team the application

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,719
developers and I pretty much developed

00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:58,620
this attitude that they were an

00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:01,150
especially dangerous breed of users on

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,670
who under no circumstances should be

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,870
allowed to do anything to production

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,720
because you know think of what they

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,599
would do to it and a lot of that was a

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,129
product of the time that the tooling I

00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,829
mean it was some of it was culture but

00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:16,750
some of it was oh gosh we carefully hand

00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,400
whittled these servers what if the

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,620
developers touch them what if they tip

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,389
over oh there's this special snowflake

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,639
server that does this one thing and you

00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:26,260
know some guy named Bob knows everything

00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,879
about it and he has a bunch of bash

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,159
scripts and that's the only thing that I

00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,349
can make that server keep working well

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,159
if we let the developers loose on it

00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:39,190
what's going to happen and I think that

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,319
having that kind of you know problems in

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,500
your organization which I definitely

00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:47,260
contributed to from the system inside I

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,359
is what leads to these silos I I took

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,459
this picture from Amtrak in North Dakota

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:53,530
I'm pretty sure that that installation

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,720
is some sort of fracking thing on by

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,780
Halliburton but it sort of made me think

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:02,199
of how separate dev and ops can be in

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,180
different organizations on when I

00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,909
decided to go to a startup as their

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,220
first ops higher it was a big adjustment

00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:12,579
because first of all I was coming from a

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,639
fairy like oh well we have ldap and and

00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:17,620
a fest and mysql and whatever is coming

00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,239
from a more old school environment and

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,180
jumping to a whole bunch of tools that

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,490
were new to me it's like AWS after my

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,690
first interview I went and set up the

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,280
free tier and tried it and then came

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:33,400
back and said yeah okay i've used it now

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:35,500
um hey and they hired me so um but a lot

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,659
of this stuff was new to me I was so

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,400
used to thinking about protecting the

00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,900
servers from the local users because in

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,500
an academic environment if you have

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,029
several thousand active accounts and

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,409
maybe some of them are active under the

00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,849
names of someone who is not

00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,860
person who's supposed to be using them

00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:52,959
whether or not the original owner knows

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,729
about this you spend a lot of time

00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,300
worrying about local user privilege

00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:00,009
escalations and going into a

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,119
software-as-a-service environment you

00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,919
spend a lot of time worrying about your

00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:05,050
API endpoints this is different set of

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,519
worries but you know what kind of data

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,999
are we exposing their that sort of thing

00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:12,489
but it did lead me to suddenly need to

00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:14,199
adjust to dealing with everything from a

00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:17,019
developer point of view since I joined a

00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,669
dev team is the only ops person to do

00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:20,129
you know all the dev in the ops makes

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,629
you chocolate with your peanut butter um

00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:26,229
and I got to tell you frankly this was

00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:28,689
terrifying um I was scared because

00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,699
suddenly I'm out of my comfort zone it's

00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:33,909
difficult to change is hard you guys

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:36,039
change is difficult and especially if

00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:37,269
you're used to be very comfortable and

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,129
everything that you're doing and knowing

00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:42,189
everything you're doing it's really hard

00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:44,289
to change and learn that maybe some of

00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:47,319
the ways that you're doing things are

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:52,419
not the only way or even the best way so

00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:55,389
that it is difficult and you know yeah

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:57,459
made me feel like that but it did hire

00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:59,769
me for a reason right there were a lot

00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:01,629
of things that the the shoot from the

00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:04,269
hip developers if you're watching guys

00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,429
hi a lot of things that they actually

00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:08,439
wanted someone to specifically focus on

00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:13,449
all those things that the apps folks are

00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:14,889
known for and the dev ops ii tools are a

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:18,639
great way to get a lot of these things

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:21,459
done I mean yes I mean yes I I do now

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,929
right enough Python to use boto or maybe

00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:26,889
a little more and enough Ruby to you

00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:28,929
chef I still tell Python to use bash

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:32,919
stuff from time to time I mean I use

00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:36,489
subprocess I'm not totally evil but it

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:38,829
was really I feel very lucky that I

00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:41,559
adjusted to a DevOps you sort of way of

00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:45,249
working in this team of people that were

00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:47,769
fine with not forcing me to start using

00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:50,649
sublime text or whatever it's like okay

00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:53,169
I'm happy in VI I want to use it and

00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:55,569
they're like oh but pycharm is great but

00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:59,079
you know what as long as I'm committing

00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:01,240
to the same you know repos etc it

00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,560
doesn't necessarily matter I mean so

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,810
again

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,169
you've got your your pillars of DevOps

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,090
or whatever I had a lot of trouble with

00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,960
the pillars thing just because that

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,150
makes me things that they're all

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,700
separate and I don't actually see these

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:17,490
as separate things because the culture

00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,570
makes a big difference to how all of the

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,910
rest of this plays out in your

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:25,290
organization and yeah so I just I don't

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,570
know I see it is like one giant pillar

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,830
one giant CN Tower you've got your

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,780
sharing right there if you ever go up

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,820
the CN tower in toronto and stand on the

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:38,550
like plexiglass platform can look down

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:40,650
um and yes okay so yeh culture let's

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,840
have a touchy-feely culture talking

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,540
glitter bomb with you with dev ops yeah

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,970
um it actually does matter but not

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,639
because DevOps will just be something

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,110
that you can you know open the Pandora's

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,070
box of and it makes your organization

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,870
happy and better it's more that when I

00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:02,010
was a system in and they were the

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:04,470
developers and we were fight we weren't

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,640
necessarily working to the same goals we

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,789
were working towards the goals of our

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,789
small subset of the organization not the

00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:15,360
goals of the whole organization and the

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:17,039
DevOps mindset is yes you're actually

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,320
working towards the goals of the whole

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,590
organization and when I mentioned before

00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,510
about tools okay yes of course you need

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:29,340
to use your source control in your group

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:31,950
chat and whatever but if I want to use

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,330
or see or vam or whatever that's not the

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:39,479
end of the world as long as we get the

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:41,250
same end result on again the it's i

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,229
think in dev ops stuff and dug up

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:48,450
circles we focus a lot on tools and they

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:50,130
are important but you also saw that you

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,020
know again in mitchell slides there were

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,630
a lot of different tools that can be

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,520
worked together to do different things

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,260
or the same things and as long as your

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,779
organization is on the same page when it

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,790
comes to yeah ok you have group chat

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:06,060
you're going to use you know you can use

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,160
IRC or campfire hip chatter your slack

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,470
is the new hotness is anyone here using

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,529
slack yet ok so is it the new hotness

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,139
it's pretty nice ok

00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:20,410
I don't know we move we move from RC or

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:22,600
from IRC to hipchat and I don't know

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,730
maybe select we'll see but anyway so

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,259
yeah okay if you have the one person on

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,269
your team who you have to go over on

00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:29,410
skype or on you know google chat or

00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:30,519
whatever to talk to them because they're

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,559
not on the group chat with everyone

00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,300
that's a huge problem but which group

00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,610
chat your organization is using that

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,160
doesn't really matter right I mean

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,620
feature wise it might matter but as long

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,089
as you're actually doing this stuff it

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:48,519
doesn't the tool is not the most

00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:52,029
important thing and yeah okay we use

00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,800
chef there are plenty of other choices

00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:56,230
to use for your infrastructure as code

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,730
piece but the important part is so that

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,129
you don't have that special snowflake

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,259
server where the dude named Bob is the

00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:03,759
only person who understands it because

00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:05,139
I'm sure and I've never actually worked

00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,240
with anyone named Bob that I can

00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,860
recollect but I'm sure that all of you

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,480
are aware of this metaphorical Bob

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,009
person where you're like who you're a

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,339
terrible blocker you know the Brent from

00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:17,499
the Phoenix project and if your

00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:19,240
infrastructure is actually not

00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:21,250
documented in something that's hopefully

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,439
correct but actually reproducible from

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,629
code that's going to make a huge

00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:27,279
difference so that's in your automation

00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:29,410
but again that's part of your culture

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,800
too since people have to actually buy

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,449
into this in the whole cams thing the

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,269
measuring the measurement thing is great

00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:39,370
I assume you most you have probably read

00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,500
the coatis craft blog post about

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,050
graphite and stats d which is what this

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,089
quote is from Ian actually lives in

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,649
Minnesota one of the one of the few etsy

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:50,110
employees or maybe only its employees

00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:52,629
who does but he came and gave a great

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,240
talk about Etsy's culture of failure is

00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:57,429
always an option and again a lot of why

00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,870
they can move fast and any organizations

00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:01,660
that want to act like that can move fast

00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,189
and actually accomplish stuff is you

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,980
know what you're doing because you're

00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:07,540
measuring it and again tools not

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,420
necessarily the most important thing I

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,829
do like graphite and stats d I could

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,970
talk about them at length but I'm not

00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:14,439
going to because this is not a tools

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,410
talk and also everything is running long

00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:18,459
and you all want lunch but anyway just

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,550
the idea of being able to actually

00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:23,110
measure stuff but again your

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,199
organization has to actually buy into

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,300
this so it comes back to culture the

00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:31,600
transparency fig was actually a big deal

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:35,290
me going to a startup that had you know

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,850
much more open year they had they had a

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,060
big board in the war room they had a you

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,680
know a much more open exposure of the

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,260
stuff that was happening in the

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,930
development operation then you would see

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,630
in some big companies or it's some big

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,180
companies not all or academia or whatnot

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,880
and that actually does make a huge

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,310
difference so you get your you're

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,200
blameless post-mortems and what have you

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:03,880
it does help a lot um this is a good

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,200
example of something that we actually

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,430
experienced a couple of weeks ago on is

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,950
having the stuff up on the big board

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:17,560
made it really really obvious coming in

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:18,970
one morning that we had a we had noticed

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,670
that I've removed any identifying

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:25,540
details to protect the guilty we had a

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:29,140
client whose third party provider of

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,490
other services clearly messed with what

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,740
how our stuff was being delivered to the

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,360
client and you could the the purple

00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,220
stuff is what the traffic had looked

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,020
like the previous day what it should

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,290
have looked like the green stuff is what

00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,150
happened that morning this is the sort

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,070
of thing where yes you could get really

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,840
fancy with some anomaly detection but

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,760
would you have really thought about to

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,300
set thresholds for these specific

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,700
problems well on the graph it was very

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,130
very obvious that something is very

00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,080
wrong and has been turned off and our

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,390
client success person was able to get on

00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,820
the phone immediately with the you know

00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:07,180
relevant parties and get this cleared up

00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,490
you can obviously see right where up but

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,680
this is the sort of thing that having

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,960
that out that kind of information out in

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,640
public that people like clients client

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,560
success can look at makes a huge

00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,280
difference to the transparency and also

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:25,570
communication in your organization and

00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,970
also again there's a Jeff Cessna has a

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,460
really good blog post about empathy in

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,610
dev ops and I recommend everyone go read

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,930
it and I don't have a link to it here of

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,800
course because that'd be too helpful but

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,330
you know I'll put something on Twitter

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,560
later and the idea being that yes I

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,860
might be

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,900
down focused on HBase this day and yes

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,760
this front-end person might really be

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,200
trying to get something to work for

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:56,410
production with nodejs and the idea of

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,570
empathy is yes this I care whether or

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,640
not he's having a good day so that's

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,950
enough to make me care even temporarily

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,480
about nodejs which is saying a lot

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:09,790
because this happen but the idea being

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,580
that yes sometimes it's going to be

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,900
difficult or aggravating to actually set

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,339
aside the thing that you're working on

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,550
if one of your colleagues has something

00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:20,710
else that they really need but again if

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:26,560
dev and ops are going to cooperate you

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:28,029
need to and the other thing is you yeah

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,680
okay we hear about the whole no ops

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,600
thing or whatever and anyone who's in

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,150
apps kind of laugh single aha good luck

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:39,670
with that but ops is changing and you

00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,950
can't necessarily be a system in the way

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,210
we're a system in you know back when you

00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,450
were running son of us and everything

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,220
was super and you know and I us had to

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,440
come along because sons yellowpages was

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,750
a thing you can't necessarily operate

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,070
exactly like that forever as people were

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,220
saying earlier today this feels

00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:59,650
constantly changing and you know Deming

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,440
has a pretty good insight there yeah

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,360
okay um winter isn't coming for that

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,130
snowman I mean there's if you don't

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,660
change there's a storm sewer that would

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:12,600
be perfectly happy to have you melt into

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:17,050
it but changing probably a better option

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,000
so basically this is it's been kind of

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,400
an interesting this has been about a

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,400
year and a half for me I'm changing from

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,740
being a really you know sissa man who

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,570
thought that developers were dangerous

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,440
Cowboys shoot-from-the-hip probably

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,160
shouldn't be allowed to touch anything

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,610
ever to person who cheerfully showed you

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,350
know the front end a guy in question how

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,520
to kick off yet another chef Ron if you

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:45,029
want something updated and proud

00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:47,680
immediately it's you have to have the

00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:50,020
humility to accept that you have to

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,350
learn new things but also you have to

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,500
have like the I don't know just the

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:59,439
attitude of

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:02,709
the developers have a lot to offer their

00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:04,389
tools are really useful & simmons and

00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,310
developers working together makes stuff

00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:10,779
a lot better than people then working

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:12,459
apart so there's this is one day of

00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:14,350
DevOps in Mountain West hack week which

00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:17,259
is pretty awesome and I'm glad that they

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,230
have it and there are also DevOps days

00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:22,149
which is two solid days of all dev ops

00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,250
stuff and we're going to have one in

00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:26,379
Minneapolis mid-july probably we're

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,579
still locking down the date but i'm

00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:30,189
still looking down the venue but we

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:31,810
should know very soon and just devops

00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,800
days dot org gives you a lot more

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,850
information about stuff like this and

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,050
I've been to a couple of them and

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,329
they're really valuable and really

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:43,230
interesting lots of tools stuff also

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:48,790
some culture stuff you know a good mix

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:51,970
so anyway um so that's all I have in

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,620
this particular talk if if you want to

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,980
hit me up on Twitter you can talk about

00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,379
dev or apps or commas and direct address

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:05,230
because details are important and that's

00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:07,530
always driven me crazy um so yeah that's

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,530
my talk

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,760
