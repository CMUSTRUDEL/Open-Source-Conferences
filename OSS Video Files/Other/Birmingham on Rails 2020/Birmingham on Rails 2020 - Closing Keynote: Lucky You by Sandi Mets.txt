00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,210
[Music]

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,210
[Applause]

00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:23,250
all right I have a I know it's the end

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,470
of the day and you gotta be tired all

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,990
right you get like congratulations on

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,109
sucking it up and doing it and how many

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,020
people have like snuck over and gone to

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,399
the Science Museum and instead of every

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,320
time I go out there there's some small

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,730
child having fun and something I want to

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,680
play in my talk exactly fits in this

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,820
time slot so I kind of got to get going

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,440
but there's just a couple things I want

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,469
to do before I get started one is that

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:56,699
I'm gonna think of sponsors like they

00:00:49,469 --> 00:01:00,210
pay the bills yeah let's do that you

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,129
know there's a thing that like we can

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,390
communicate and hang out online but it's

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,610
really different to be here together and

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,280
I want you to really appreciate what it

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,780
means to all be together and meet each

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
other and look at each other's faces and

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,330
they pay to make that happen so good on

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,750
them the other thing is I'm so grateful

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,400
to the organizers like for those of you

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,490
like I do not have the event

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,170
organization gene which means that if it

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,020
works I mean we would never get to do

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,780
this and I live a life now where I do

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,180
like I go to conferences fairly

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,770
regularly so I get to see not only how

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,770
much they matter to us as a community

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,229
but how much work it takes to get one

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,270
done and so if you haven't yet stopped

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,009
someone who seems like an organizer and

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,140
shaking their hand and and thank them

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,850
you should do that before you go I can't

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,240
want them to want to do this again next

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,439
year right alright so go tell them tell

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,860
them how much you appreciate the work

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,659
they've done all right let's do one more

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,740
thing it's a really bad wine doing this

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,310
because sometimes it's hard to get you

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:09,179
back look around you have a met the

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,910
people that you're sitting near alright

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,870
so I'm making like 30 seconds

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:18,110
introducers

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,110
to someone sitting near you do it gone

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:27,330
you should have done it soon okay can I

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:30,120
ask it's just am I too loud loud okay

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,530
too much so it's funny you know when

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,110
you're up here you can't really tell is

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:39,480
that loud enough can everybody hear is

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:42,840
that okay that's so really right here is

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,940
that true a little bit more okay so in

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,640
the back it's your job to tell me if I

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,950
drift from this mean all right so just

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,780
yell tell me louder or softer and I'll

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,810
do it I really will I'm so be in that

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:59,310
way all right so let's go we're short on

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,930
time so oh my gosh like I am someone

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,010
whose name you might know for some of

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,140
you that's probably true and it is so

00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:10,410
amazingly unlikely that that would it

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,980
ever have happened I've been so

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:19,890
incredibly lucky and it makes me wonder

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:21,030
about you I am so not oh there we go

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,739
here wait let's see that again

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,239
you know the clicker someday I'll get a

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,090
whole slideshow without screwing up and

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,569
clicking I already this one is not gonna

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,519
be that one is it cuz I just did it

00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:35,400
sorry lucky what do you think

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,870
fortunes smiling on you yeah I see heads

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,010
nodding that's good alright you know cuz

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,139
some people when I ask that question

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,859
they're like now I have a black cloud of

00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:48,870
evil bad luck following me around which

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:49,829
is true sometimes so if you're one of

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,750
those people if you're one of the people

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,090
it feels unlucky I have good news for

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,489
you the sky you seems Richard Wiseman

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,690
he's a psychologist at university in the

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:02,790
UK he did research on luck he did 10

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,500
years study and it was his results are

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,790
written up in this paper all this

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,410
stuff's gonna be in the references later

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,139
so I wrote a paper called the luck

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,329
factor and he discovered that there are

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,030
four principles so that lucky people

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,880
used to generate their own good fortune

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,489
I mean which means that luck can be

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,039
hacked this is the first principle pay

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,860
attention all right so what he was he

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,780
took a bunch of people and he had them

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,750
sort self-select themselves into groups

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,330
where they consider themselves lucky or

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,860
and he interviewed them he did

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,330
personality profiles and tried to figure

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,250
out what was different about the people

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,440
who are lucky versus the people who are

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,690
unlucky all right and so these are four

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,450
characteristics of lucky people first

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,090
they pay attention which means that

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:51,960
they're not they're not focused inward

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,700
they're focused externally there's a

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,830
famous part of a study you might have

00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,810
heard of it there was a place he gave

00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,760
people a task of looking through a

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,680
newspaper and counting photos of a

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,750
certain thing and so he told people

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,190
here's a newspaper go through it and as

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,750
fast as you can and count the number of

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,750
times you see picked a picture of thing

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:13,290
X and on the second page it said stop

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,760
counting there are 43 but what happened

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,350
was the lucky people were actually

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,240
looking around and they would notice

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,580
that in quit counting the unlucky people

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,770
could not see it because they were they

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,690
were so tunnel vision and concentrating

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,760
on trying to find the photos it did

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,250
thing the the photos of the things so

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,240
the first thing is pay attention the

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,340
second notion is to be open it turns out

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,840
that lucky people were one of the things

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,660
that makes them lucky as they listen to

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,730
their intuition so they have some sense

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,140
of what might be true in the world and

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,800
they're kind of willing to go with the

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,140
flow

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,440
so openness paying attention and being

00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,030
open this one is a little

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,180
counterintuitive lucky people it turns

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,700
out they just didn't expect to be lucky

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,980
there it's almost like they're

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,500
practicing luck there they create little

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,460
self-fulfilling luck prophecies that

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,980
then can't become true and finally the

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,630
last one is you have to interpret the

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,020
lucky people interpret the things that

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,730
happen to them as if it was luck right

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,170
there's this thing called counterfactual

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,840
reasoning where you make up little

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,310
stories to explain reality and one of

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,800
the things that lucky people do is they

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,200
use they interpret things as if they

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,380
were positive like I was in a bank that

00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,760
got robbed I could say oh my god I was

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,100
in a bank that got robbed what bad luck

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,130
you know even of course me it had to be

00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,510
me or he could say I was somewhere where

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,250
there was a robbery and not only was it

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,890
a tremendously interesting experience

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,889
but nobody got hurt all right it's a

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,719
matter of where you look at it I I first

00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:47,009
herd so here's the list I first heard

00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:50,039
about this research from a woman named

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,569
Sarah May a number of years ago and who

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,960
gave a conference talk on it and right

00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,240
after that rafter I heard it there I

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,520
went to Spain and took a bike trip and

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,229
it was a self supported by trip and we

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,490
got maps and directions from someone who

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,919
probably should not have been in that

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,860
business and so what that meant was we

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,870
got lost every day we spent the whole

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,729
time driving pedaling through basque

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,439
country and it would be like getting

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,569
dark and raining and we would be

00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,569
searching for the hotel at the end of

00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:19,740
every day and and the my partner who was

00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,620
with me at the time we look at each

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,629
other we just read this research and at

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,639
the end of every day since we're having

00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:28,259
so many opportunities for new

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,210
experiences we look at each other and

00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,870
say well at least we're improving our

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,439
luck and it it actually made everything

00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,930
better

00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,279
like we could in time the times a day

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,289
when we might have otherwise been having

00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,120
a fight and being grumpy we were

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:45,949
laughing like hyenas because we felt

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,449
like our luck was being improved and so

00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:52,250
taken together this list of things

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:54,479
suggest that you can make your own luck

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,430
and it really is true

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,110
alright so Wiseman he'd learned he'd

00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,699
done one of these things and he took the

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,699
unlucky people and he taught them these

00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:07,649
principles and they indeed reported that

00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,939
they were luckier later so maybe you're

00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:10,770
already making your luck I don't know

00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:13,199
maybe you should go try to practice

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,990
those things a little bit more um I can

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,919
tell like I know that you're pretty

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:22,500
lucky cuz you're here alright you're in

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,509
this room today you got time off work

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,250
are you like like normally I would say

00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:28,560
you paid something but you're so lucky

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,839
that they found sponsors to pay for you

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,279
and that's super lucky right you live in

00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,110
a town where there is a conference you

00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:38,039
live in a place where you can have a job

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:40,620
like this as a group programmers work

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,680
we're just amazingly lucky I have some

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,800
data about this this is the 2017 data

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,610
set from the Bureau of the US Bureau of

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,319
Labor Statistics and I said programmer

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,970
issued jobs here because it is really

00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:55,500
hard to get a list the way they

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,560
categorized jobs of every

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,940
that would be a programming job so your

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
mileage may vary here's what I did I

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,870
went and found all the jobs that had the

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,760
word computer in them and I threw away

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:11,250
everything that said repair or

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,140
maintenance or testing maybe not a good

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,200
idea but that's what I did and once I

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:22,890
did that I was left with 2.3 million

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:24,600
programming jobs in 2017 and this data

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,540
said I picked this dataset because it

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,560
had incomes in it and at that point the

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,800
median income across all these jobs was

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,390
$85,000 now we just had a Anthony

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,260
wherever he went he was talking about

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,880
how averages will lie to you and so I

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,490
feel I needed to give you the tiny

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,550
little stats lesson here okay imagine

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:51,860
that you had 10 scores and nine of them

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:54,630
were won and the 10th was a billion

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,570
what does does he is the average and

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,700
accurate reflection no it's not right

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,680
which is how averages lie to you the

00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,440
median score is the score on the

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,140
midpoint of the line if you put all

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,500
those numbers down so median score isn't

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,780
much it reduces the effect of outliers

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,950
and so all the numbers I give you I'm

00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,970
not gonna give you a verges I'm going to

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,240
give you Millions

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:22,230
and so the median score the - 2017 and

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,760
median wage of programmers was $85,000

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,100
in this data set I think that's an under

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,310
reporting there's a there's a lot of

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,230
good data like there's 2018 data that

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,540
suggest that programmers make more in

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,400
the hundred thousand the median income

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,580
for programmers is when I got her

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,580
thousand maybe first system e-type

00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,380
people more like 110 and and so because

00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,150
I know a little bit about the more

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,910
current data I'm gonna just round this

00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,500
up a little bit and call it ninety-three

00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,110
thousand dollars I'm kind of making that

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,650
up but I picked this number for a reason

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:58,170
and this is why do you does anybody can

00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,790
you be guess what the median income of

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,030
the average worker in the United States

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,030
is

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,420
all right so you're you're either you

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,660
are probably either already making her

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,290
gonna make three times as much money as

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:20,320
the average worker in the United States

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:22,990
now because I have this data set I can

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,220
break this up by gender now do not

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,470
imagine that I'm unaware of the

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,600
demographics of this room don't be

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,130
nervous

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,320
all right it's just tell yourself it's

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:36,010
just data all right because that's what

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,290
it is okay so for gender so if there's

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,560
this two million three hundred thousand

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:44,500
such of people then of those illness

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:48,610
data set he reported about 1.7 million

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:51,670
males and almost 600,000 females but if

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,519
you believe the NIH when they say that

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:58,660
about 390 out of every hundred thousand

00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:02,350
humans are non-binary then this really

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,329
proudly looks more like that now we know

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:08,920
why it's reported as male or female it's

00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:12,750
because on the the Bureau of Labor and

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:16,029
Statistics website had two radio buttons

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,829
one for me and one for female right and

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:19,750
so everybody had to fit themselves into

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:22,839
one of these two categories I put this

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:25,630
on here I put that number on here like

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,060
I'm gonna turn into percents like that

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,100
then the number is so small that you can

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,329
almost not see the color on the graph

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,760
here but and I mean thousands on people

00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:38,050
is a lot of people and I think I think

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,519
it's time to sort of wake up to the fact

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,870
that there's a bunch of people out there

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,550
that don't fit in these categories and

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,320
then you have the power to give them

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,890
their own radio button you should

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,230
consider doing that now I was sort of

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,459
struck by the binstock on language is

00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,470
like I don't know how if you're a

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:54,820
non-binary person which is a little bit

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,709
conceivable to me but it is true that

00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,089
there are people like that like I don't

00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,610
know how you live in them if your

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,370
language is gendered it must be so

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,040
disorienting I don't know by this number

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,529
like if in a room this size there is

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,630
likely a person in here and it feels

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:12,910
like there are they and not a he and she

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,920
and it just feels like we can be general

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,500
enough generous enough to make space for

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,660
that in the world it is what it is

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,830
all right so now we got from now on I'm

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,140
not putting a number on the rest of

00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,940
these just because I don't I can't make

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,980
up D I don't know how to derive that

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,470
data from the data set I have but you

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,080
should consider that when you collect it

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,430
yourself all right so I had ethnicity in

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,960
the state said take a minute and just

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,250
this is actually this is a different

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,790
data set this does for 2019

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:44,950
take him and imagine I know you're gonna

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:47,650
be shocked and this it turns out this is

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:50,080
for computer all programming jobs in the

00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,940
United States it turns out that for the

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,730
numbers are worse for the really big

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,390
tech companies like if you go to Google

00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:02,170
or Facebook or Twitter they're more like

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:04,180
56% white and more like 37% Asian and

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,920
way so what we know is like the more

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,110
important the businesses the bigger the

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,960
influence it has the less diversity they

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,890
have which it isn't it doesn't really

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,440
seem like a good thing

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:19,830
so now let's go let's look at income now

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm back in at 217 Dave 2017 dataset so

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:26,770
whatever the medium was a 5 but because

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,740
there are women get paid more than women

00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:33,880
so the median for males is that for

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:38,200
women is that it turns out that's not

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,870
really bad that's like 90% which is

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,270
pretty good relative to the rest of the

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,240
world like in most jobs women make about

00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:49,180
eighty eight eight eighty cents on the

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,110
dollar of what men do and so in some

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,060
ways you can think that's good the the

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,300
thing that makes it a little bit bad

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,750
news is that in out of the world world

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,780
women hold about 43 44 percent of all

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:07,720
jobs and in programming it's more like

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,540
25 and so it's a good news bad news

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,950
thing all right like the there's less

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,160
disparity in terms of pay across gender

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,770
and programming but there's fair women

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,860
here there's less diversity - so I'm

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,050
glass half full and then because I had

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,700
this data and I could do it I kind of

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:27,250
wanted to figure out who got what part

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,579
of the pie because I had this data and a

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:33,220
Google Google spreadsheet foo and so

00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:37,199
here's what we have so the men makes

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,309
because there's more man they take

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,799
there's more higher percentage of men

00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,910
and they get paid more so this over this

00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:46,299
is higher than their actual

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:47,439
representation and the data set so we're

00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:49,509
going to get less than their

00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:51,129
representation it turns out that if you

00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:53,889
if you start putting ethnicity on here

00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:56,170
then the whites white men and women make

00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:59,110
up about get about 50% of the money paid

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:02,470
to programmers if he had Asians in your

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:05,110
about up to 80 this is the key for

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,910
everybody else who's who take on some

00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,489
some little money I couldn't even put

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:12,239
their percentages would not fit on in

00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:14,259
the spaces I had on the graph all right

00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:16,259
and so I'm not trying to make you for a

00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:19,149
bad this is facts right it's just data

00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:21,279
what we know though so so what we know

00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:22,239
from how the scene is like we have it

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,239
pretty good

00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:26,889
I no matter what category you fit into

00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:29,350
we're doing great here in programming

00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:33,369
but but it is true that if you were an

00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:36,040
alien and you came to Planet Earth

00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:37,899
and you want it to be a programmer and

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,829
you got to choose your gender and

00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:43,540
ethnicity will you make a white guy

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:47,739
alright you just would that's that's an

00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:49,709
absolute fact all right so well it might

00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:53,339
be true that you can improve your luck

00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:57,100
you just came with your demographic

00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:59,169
mostly that's mostly true and so if you

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,329
happen to have been born into one of

00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:03,519
those demographics well lucky you all

00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:05,169
right that's like there's no way in

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,689
which I think you are responsible for

00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:11,889
the situation of your birth but it is

00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:13,720
also true that some some both the

00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:16,600
demographics are luckier than others and

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,329
that's just a fact um but now we're

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,769
talking about being born it turns out

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:25,209
that the neighborhood that you were born

00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:26,829
in also matters a lot this guy's name is

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,559
Raj Chetty

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,570
he's a micro economist at Harvard and he

00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,279
did a bunch of research that created

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,769
this website it's called the opportunity

00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,419
atlas don't go look at it now but you

00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:39,399
should look at it later he's the black

00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:41,500
hole you see a radical from which you

00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:43,559
will never emerge when you start looking

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,680
at his day so here's what he did he took

00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,720
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,910
Americans and they're in their mid 30

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,080
city the ages that probably some of you

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:55,060
are and he got he got data from the

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,040
census from federal income tax returns

00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:01,060
and from something called the American

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,550
Community Survey and he combined all of

00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:08,730
that data into a big database now here's

00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:11,770
what the database does it it tells you

00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:15,970
things four qualities that people have

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:18,970
today it tracks them back to where you

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:22,000
were born and they such that you can do

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:24,430
some predictions you can find out you

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,200
can figure out the influence of the

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:29,950
conditions of your birth in your

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:34,710
neighborhood what how that matter later

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:37,570
in life all right and one of the things

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,970
so they they know like your parents

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,440
income and what they map all the way

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,170
down here I'll show you the map here

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,450
they map down to the census tract so

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,370
census tract is like four thousand some

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,190
people this isn't the homepage of is

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,900
that for you so this is just what you

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,470
see if you go right the very first time

00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:00,130
you go to that thing to the website this

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:03,630
shows current household income for all

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:06,970
genders in any race who grew up in

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:09,280
families of any income who were born in

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,830
these census tract for families that had

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,350
any income so it's it's telling you how

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,860
people are doing today and we're born in

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:20,350
these places the colors that one colors

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,650
represent less money that number is 25

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,560
less than $25,000 the blue colors the

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,150
corner colors represent more money so

00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,190
now I'm going to zoom back in it back

00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,350
out again and let you look at the whole

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,850
map you can so you can draw some

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,210
conclusions just from looking at this

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,010
like the south as always takes it on the

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,670
chin

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:45,280
here's Birmingham you can see that up in

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,680
the middle of the country the outcomes

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,240
for kids seem to be better all that blue

00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:54,380
except for these places in South Dakota

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:58,550
can't guess what that is

00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:00,590
yeah Indian reservations I don't know I

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,770
feel condemned already all right I'm

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:06,050
gonna second but this is a and the

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,610
census tract is often a much smaller

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,120
thing this is this is the combined

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:13,670
tracks I'm gonna zoom into la here this

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,590
is sorry here I did an extra click you

00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:18,020
see if I can go back so this is a

00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:20,420
household income current household

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,570
income for children born to low-income

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,580
parents in these places and you can see

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,990
that there's a big disparity here and

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,870
you get this you start getting a sense

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,650
here of how close the census tracts are

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,700
in a place is densely populated as LA

00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,650
what you can find

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,060
so now we're looking at incarceration

00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,640
rates there's a whole bunch of very

00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,470
interesting data here so this is an

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:46,100
incarceration rate for black boy

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:49,700
children born to low-income parents this

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,870
is that's watts right there that's at

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:56,810
one census tract

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:59,510
here's Compton right there I'm gonna

00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,920
zoom in just a little bit more notice

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,740
there are only different colors the

00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:08,300
incarceration rate for black males born

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:12,560
to low-income parents it's 44 percent

00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:15,830
for kids born in watts and it's 6.2

00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,200
percent four kids born Compton these

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,170
neighborhoods are demographically almost

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,660
identical they're two and a half miles

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:26,540
apart in Los Angeles and yet the

00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:31,220
outcomes for children are really really

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:33,530
different and it because so many other

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,590
factors are the same you have to think

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:38,960
that it is not equality of those boys it

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,430
is not equality of those men but

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,260
determines whether or not the end up

00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:47,480
being incarcerated it's something about

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:49,940
the neighborhoods where they grew up so

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:53,060
this is the promise of America this is

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:56,090
the dream that if you work hard and you

00:21:53,060 --> 00:22:00,410
do well you can succeed even if you

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:02,600
start out with nothing they have the

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,810
data on this how often do you think in

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,809
the modern world how often is that dream

00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:10,039
achieved

00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:12,499
what is the likelihood if you're born in

00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:13,909
the bottom quintile in America the

00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:16,340
bottom quintile of income the bottom

00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:21,679
fifth of income that you can rise to the

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:23,029
top it's seven and a half percent it

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,799
still it's a little bit better up here

00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:29,779
this is more like 14% up here it's sadly

00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:33,950
way worse down here where we live most

00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:36,350
of us live some of the places down here

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:40,789
like Atlanta and Charlotte like there's

00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:44,149
no super economically prosperous cities

00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:45,590
in the south and yet you can see by

00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:48,049
looking at this map that somehow that

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,970
prosperity is not shared that the

00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:51,679
children growing up in these places born

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,369
to low-income parents in these places

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,769
are not they're not able to improve

00:22:55,369 --> 00:23:00,320
their lot as if their life skills as

00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:02,389
their lives go on so what is it about

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,989
neighborhoods it turns out there's

00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:09,470
Chetty identified four factors one is

00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:11,590
that this was this was amazing to me I

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:15,889
read it places where people are

00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:20,239
segregated by race and income have poor

00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:21,320
outcomes for everyone all right it's not

00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:23,539
just people at the bottom of the

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,080
socioeconomic status that whose outcomes

00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:27,229
are bad

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,059
everyone's outcomes go down in a

00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:32,840
community where there's a segregation by

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:34,549
race or income and I'm gonna be really

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,859
careful about how I say the second one's

00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:40,309
neighborhood neighborhoods where most

00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:42,499
families are one parent families have

00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:44,479
poorer outcomes for children now let me

00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:47,720
be really clear it is not the condition

00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:49,970
of having a single parent it is a

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,399
condition of living in a neighborhood

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,749
where most families have one parents so

00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:55,729
if you're the child of a two-parent

00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:58,519
family in a neighborhood that's mostly

00:23:55,729 --> 00:24:00,710
one parent families your outcomes are

00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,509
worse all right it's not about your size

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,460
it's about it's not about your families

00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:08,210
about the neighborhood that you're

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:10,190
living in the third was schools schools

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:13,369
really matter outcomes can be directly

00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,840
you can draw a line back from kids kids

00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,789
income kids outcomes later in life to

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,769
the schools I went to and finally

00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,570
there's this idea of social capital like

00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:21,560
your neighborhoods or communities where

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,780
people know each other

00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,240
and Kant will pitch in and help if

00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,670
you're in trouble or you need a you know

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,050
care of some sort like that if the

00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,940
neighborhoods that are high in social

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:36,050
capital that outcomes are better for

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:38,210
kids and so here's what Shetty did he he

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:41,990
put they put a number on what it would

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:46,280
mean like if you could take many cities

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:48,470
have census blocks that are good for

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,690
outcomes for children and not so good

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,550
for outcomes for children and Chetty has

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,920
calculated that if you could take a kid

00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,840
at birth and move them just across town

00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,850
like in their same County

00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,990
into from a neighborhood that had poor

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,790
outcomes to a neighborhood that had

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,470
better outcomes that their lifetime

00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:07,310
earnings would be two hundred and six

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:09,260
thousand dollars greater this is such a

00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,850
big number that they're they're actually

00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,010
running experiments in Detroit and

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,630
Seattle right now where they're doing

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,430
just that they're trying to break down

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,980
the barriers that keep people from

00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,440
moving out of neighborhoods many of

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,420
which mostly boil down to no one will

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,740
rent to you in those other neighborhoods

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,240
if you've come from a low-income

00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,630
neighborhood especially if you've ever

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,790
been evicted and so we're working on

00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,560
that they're they're spending tax

00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,970
dollars for advocates to help people

00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,610
move because they think that's an

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,770
investment that will pay off in terms of

00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,030
the tap that by increasing the ability

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,050
of those people to make higher income

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:47,030
and pay more taxes later and so the data

00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:48,770
you know this it remains to be seen how

00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,180
those experience will turn out but it's

00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,950
a super interesting idea and people are

00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:56,270
doing practical things on the ground

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,950
with a Chetty data so neighborhoods

00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,240
matter but it's also true that they

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,600
don't matter in the same way for

00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,070
everyone if you compare black in white

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,360
boys who are growing up on the same

00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:09,620
block both who have parents working from

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,750
temporary families that are earning

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:14,390
about the same amount of income the

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,430
black men have a much lower chance of

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:18,560
upward mobility in them than the white

00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:20,600
men and it's also tributes a double

00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,390
whammy if you're a black man and your

00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,040
parents are high income your chance of

00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,320
falling back down the income ladder is

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,660
much higher too and I have a direct

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,250
quote from Chetty he says if you think

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,960
about upward mobility is climbing an

00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,120
income ladder for white men it's more

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,250
like being on a tread

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,929
for black men so the neighborhood you

00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,700
grew up and has a lot to do with your

00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:46,150
ability to be more successful than your

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,650
parents but even so recent gender really

00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,679
matter you can't take that out of the

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,679
equation

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,710
this is Randolph Drive in Parkersburg

00:26:54,610 --> 00:27:00,760
West Virginia the street on which I grew

00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:02,470
up my house is right there I'm gonna

00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:06,940
turn the picture and then let you see it

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:10,419
my dad was thoroughly dyslexic and in

00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:12,429
the mid 1940s he quit going to school

00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:14,860
because he was he was 15 he couldn't

00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:16,539
read and he got tired he was just bored

00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,279
got tired of sitting in the back of the

00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:19,390
classroom and so when the truant

00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:21,159
officers came he got him

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,010
they told him either had to go to school

00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,720
and go to jail or they gave him a third

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:29,740
option they would help him lie about his

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,419
age and he could join the army because

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,070
that was back when they weren't such a

00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:35,559
good data about when you were born

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,020
so they forged the birth certificate for

00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:39,730
him and he joined the army he meant he

00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,830
meant that when he became my mom he he

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:46,090
was stationed to Fort Benning in Georgia

00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:47,860
and he met my mom there and then I don't

00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:50,140
know like the army still thinks he's

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,490
older than he is like when he goes to

00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:56,200
the VA hospital has a different date

00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:59,230
than his real birth date but they knew

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,600
the people like his sergeant and his is

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,890
like the other people that were in with

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,080
him at boot camp knew that he was

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:07,210
underage but apparently he was kind of a

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,130
smartass like they try to protect him

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,830
for a while but he somehow made somebody

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:14,380
mad and so they like said okay that's it

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:17,140
you're going to Korea and so he was

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,700
fighting in Korea when he was 15 years

00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,950
old I know it's amazing this is like

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,039
it's hard to believe this story as well

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:29,679
all right and so he got discharged came

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:33,340
back married my mom and they returned to

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,020
Parkersburg his hometown there he drove

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,350
a bread truck for a while and he got a

00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:41,049
GED and then he became an apprentice

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:43,000
mechanic at the local newspaper he was

00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:44,740
making 75 cents an hour which is not as

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,809
bad as it sounds all right so that's

00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,779
about like 130

00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:51,879
a month so he was an apprentice and the

00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:55,090
GI Bill paid another hundred and forty

00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:57,700
so he was making 270 a month back in

00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:59,139
back in the day whenever this was when

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,730
he finally finished his apprenticeship

00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:02,559
program and took a real job he only his

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:05,590
pay raise was only actually ten bucks a

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,710
month because of the full-time wage for

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:11,379
a real Pressman mechanic at the

00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,990
news-press and purpose word was 280 so

00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:15,669
the government was deeply invested in

00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,620
people getting education in jobs that

00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:20,200
work such that they would pay you to

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:22,149
learn a trade just remember that for

00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,240
later when we get back to education in

00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:27,039
this talk so he joined the Union which

00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,749
because there were unions he joined the

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,460
Union at the newspaper and they bought

00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:32,350
this house

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,230
his mom his official mortgage rate was

00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:37,899
8% but after he became a full-time

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,600
employee at the newspaper in a few just

00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:44,799
a few years he took took advantage of a

00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:48,399
workplace program where they bought your

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:51,309
home mortgage and lent the money back to

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,440
you at half the rate just because they

00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:54,940
wanted to be good citizens it was back

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,470
in the time when they weren't trying to

00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,869
squeeze every dime out of every business

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:01,059
for the stockholders they believed that

00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:03,399
they were there to support the community

00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,009
and so his at that point times mortgage

00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:08,440
rate went from 8 percent to 4 percent

00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:10,899
and they paid wasn't long before they

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,039
paid off this house so I spent the first

00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:16,539
17 years of my life in this house on the

00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:20,409
street in Parkersburg here's a Chetty

00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:22,990
map of that area that houses right here

00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:24,519
I this I don't know what this black

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,470
thing happened since I lived there I

00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:30,549
promise you that like whatever's there

00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:33,629
wasn't fair when I was a kid this orange

00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:36,999
color this color that we're in is about

00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:39,369
$40,000 a year and and this is the

00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:42,249
household income the current household

00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:44,799
income for female children of parents of

00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:48,519
any income all right and so what we what

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:53,190
we know is that I'm doing a lot better

00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:55,779
than making $40,000 a year I'm I am way

00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:58,139
luckier than most of the people that I

00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:00,509
grew up with and went to school with and

00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:02,999
it is true I've worked

00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:06,209
hard I expect that you are working hard

00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:08,639
like I I know that I've done well and I

00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:11,219
believe that I should get some credit

00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:13,499
for my success but it feels like my

00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:15,869
efforts and my natural good nature just

00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:18,719
aren't enough to explain it like how

00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:20,579
could it be what is it that made such a

00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:22,320
difference in how my life turned out and

00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:25,859
the life of all my peers from

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,699
Parkersburg my parents relative to their

00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:32,129
parents are way more successful and

00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:33,779
their gradual movement of the income

00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:39,059
ladder started with buying that first

00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:40,829
house and in the u.s. there's a the

00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:42,899
history of housing in the United States

00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:47,129
explains a lot about who gets to be

00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:48,599
lucky it can be the difference between

00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:51,839
getting wealthy and being stuck in

00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:53,579
poverty it turns out like you and and

00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,919
and that is a kind of wealth that can be

00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:57,149
passed down through generations my

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,259
parents had a tiny house then they got a

00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,819
bigger house I think on a bigger house

00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:00,899
and I started out with little houses and

00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:02,699
I eventually got big houses and

00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:04,889
eventually if you do that it turns into

00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:07,469
real money but you have to be able to

00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:10,349
buy that first house and there's a huge

00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:14,789
gap in America between who gets to own a

00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:16,019
home this is 2016 dated your again if

00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:18,659
you're an alien you want to be white

00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,129
that's absolutely true and this gap this

00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:24,659
gap what you see on this chart right

00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:26,299
here has historical roots in 1865 after

00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:28,559
then at the end of the Civil War

00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:32,339
probably in here in areas right around

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,119
here what happened was the homemakers a

00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:35,039
new thing

00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,679
all right the slaves were freed the

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,359
plantations got broken up and the people

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,029
who were formerly slaves got given plots

00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,039
of land and that was under Lincoln and

00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:46,109
then Lincoln got shot and then when guy

00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:50,279
Johnson came in became president and he

00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:52,169
took it all back now in these days where

00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:53,819
there's impeachment is in the news every

00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:55,259
day there are four presidents who've

00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:59,549
been impeaching the history of America

00:32:55,259 --> 00:33:01,940
right top now beforehand Clinton and

00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:05,099
before him Nixon and before him who

00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:07,590
Johnson and it was over this like it's

00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:10,950
more topical than you might think

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:12,450
all right and so that so in 1865 if

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:17,159
you're black you can only land in

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:19,500
America and over the next few decades it

00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:23,909
was very hard it was not a train that

00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:25,529
reversed the most blacks didn't have

00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:27,419
enough money to buy property outright in

00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:29,340
mortgages here's how you get mortgage

00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:32,340
you took 50% down on the balance had to

00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,570
be paid off in a year or two and so she

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,440
didn't already have a lot of money there

00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:40,230
was no way a buy a house buy there was

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,779
so and this went on for like it's not

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,590
very long between 1865 and 2000 like

00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:48,659
three decades all right half a lifetime

00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,130
by the twenties by the 1920s in the

00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,539
Great Depression there's there was a big

00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,620
boom one of the things that happened

00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:55,080
that caused the Great Depression was

00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,299
there was a housing boom and bust cycle

00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,240
and so when we're deep in the depression

00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:02,870
in the 20s in America not even a

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,390
lifetime from the end of the Civil War

00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,980
the Walters in America decided that the

00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,080
government ought to get into the home

00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,149
ownership business and start lending

00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,200
money because they want to stimulate the

00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:18,659
housing market they thought like the

00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,490
ordinance they made was that if the

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,649
governor would subsidize mortgages it

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,540
would drive we could operate at scale

00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:26,369
and it would drive down the cost of

00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:29,070
homeownership and then people could

00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:31,200
start accumulating wealth and the

00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,149
government one of the ways they did that

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,919
they could provide they could provide

00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:37,349
mortgages for lower down payments for

00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:39,570
longer terms and provide insurance so

00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:41,070
the lenders wouldn't get screwed if

00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:44,599
somebody defaulted on their there's

00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,599
apparently more risky mortgage

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,460
unfortunately these programs these

00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:52,889
federal programs were the government

00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,780
us.we right did this well we're insure

00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,420
we're giving people money to buy houses

00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,339
and we're insuring those mortgages

00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,530
against default there were three

00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:04,109
principles that under law that

00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,030
underlined underlaid three things

00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:09,000
underlying this issue there are three

00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:12,119
thoughts they had they assumed that

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,740
people could be divided by race they

00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,940
assumed that only white communities

00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:19,740
would hold value and therefore they

00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,280
thought that segregation by race was

00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:25,020
Ness

00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,910
Cerie in order for to protect white

00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:30,720
property values and have people not be

00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:33,450
defaulting on those loans and so this is

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:39,030
a time when it has become cheaper in

00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:41,310
America to own than to rent and so the

00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,630
the government this is a document I'm

00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:45,510
gonna zoom in a minute this is a

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:48,360
document from from the federal home

00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:51,030
owners Loan Corporation and what they're

00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,230
trying to do this is from 1937 what

00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,320
they're trying to do is figure out where

00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:56,820
it's safe to lend people money and so

00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,960
what they do is they go around towns in

00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,490
America this happens to be the town I

00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:05,450
live in right now this is Durham North

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:05,450
Carolina and they grade neighborhoods

00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:20,760
the greens are a their first the yellows

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:23,610
and the blue so B is blue yellow B's

00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:27,150
blue C is yellow so these are where you

00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:29,190
live if you're Jewish I gave this talk

00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,600
at Ruby conference someone came up to me

00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,850
and told me about a neighborhood their

00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,320
parents had tried to move into in Durham

00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:37,020
where they were not allowed to buy a

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,930
house cuz they were Jewish like 30 years

00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:44,820
ago all right and so it all starts here

00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:46,500
all right so wait the Greens the band

00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,820
see er where you can live if you're

00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:54,930
Jewish if you're any neighborhood that

00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:57,780
has blacks in it is called D fourth

00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:59,520
grade that's they actually I can give

00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,430
you so this is what they say about so

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,090
maybe that's their brewery or whiskey

00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:06,390
neighborhoods that have blacks

00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:08,010
immigrated D no matter what economic

00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,180
status people had like you can be as

00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,210
much as you want but if you're a black

00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,340
your D and their movies are considered

00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:17,310
direct quotes worthless were likely to

00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:21,450
decline value and no one could be made

00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:22,530
either for purchasing or upgrading all

00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,630
right so what they were doing the

00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:27,930
renders we get these maps from the HLC

00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,490
and they would outline the pick the the

00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,930
years of the mountain red on these maps

00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,850
the lenders would go in there and they

00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,600
would take red pin and they would draw

00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,970
around those new

00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,580
and that's where the term redlining came

00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:41,040
from um

00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:43,440
the greeting got done here's a here's a

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:49,020
document these archives have terrifying

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,550
data in them so this is a - for those of

00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,040
you can't read it that says description

00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,930
of terrain it's gently rolling favorable

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,180
influences it's got utilities and

00:37:54,930 --> 00:38:00,350
schools and this is what dick amber she

00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:05,640
is in turn so the college is their

00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:08,460
detriment type okay so as professors

00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,380
business executives they they're making

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,530
between three and eight thousand dollars

00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,790
a year and these muskets just it's just

00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:20,850
sad why did this like this is America

00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:24,020
foreign-born nun negro nun infiltration

00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:30,120
of what does that mean I don't know none

00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:34,200
no my family's house is rented repair 90

00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:36,630
percent of the homes are owned there's

00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:41,640
plenty of mortgage money ample money for

00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:48,300
a purchase in building more w pal not

00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:49,980
21st 1937 now I never signed you I know

00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:55,860
that 1937 might seem like a long time

00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:56,820
ago my father was born in 1932 and I

00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:02,270
talked to him on the phone

00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:05,960
Tuesday four summers born in 1932 a

00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:09,860
lifetime before that puts you in 1865

00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:15,780
this was yesterday it just happened

00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:18,030
let's look at D six he's got city

00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,820
conveniences it's of course it's next to

00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,860
the railroad tracks Labor's it's got no

00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,720
fully born yes my growth question if

00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,840
there are Negroes in the place you got

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,720
to have the percent ninety percent okay

00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,330
we grew populations slowly increasing

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,330
that's what infiltration means that's

00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:39,060
how you like who infiltrates you it's

00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:42,780
like the enemy's right you don't get

00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:45,330
infiltrated by friends many release

00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,550
families fair to summer fairs and

00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,930
rapport fifteen

00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,780
percent of the people who live here own

00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:54,620
their own homes and there is no mortgage

00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:59,660
money all right

00:39:54,620 --> 00:40:01,800
the FHA and the VA adopted these rules

00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:04,200
because of what they were afraid of like

00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,400
at that point in time so segregation

00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,860
there was already segregation in America

00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,410
but it got WAY worse after this happened

00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,930
because what it meant was that if you

00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,490
lived in a neighborhood one black family

00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,980
moving into a neighborhood could get you

00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,600
downgraded which meant that everybody

00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,790
was afraid that property values were

00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,830
gonna fall and so it became really

00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:26,430
important it's cheetahs now cheaper to

00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:30,420
own them to rent in America but if you

00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:33,720
want to you can only get money to buy if

00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:36,000
you're white and and you have to rent if

00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,980
you're not white because you can't live

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,760
in those neighborhoods and the

00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,950
segregation might double down on the

00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:52,530
things in the system that cause us to

00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:57,450
segregate are now institutionalized so

00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:59,610
there's no money for you all right the

00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,020
repository that I got the Durham stuff

00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,460
out of it doesn't have every country in

00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,970
the United States but luckily for you

00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:08,100
Buckingham is in there and so if you

00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,440
want to look at the data and how the

00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,080
grading forms those forms I showed you

00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,840
for Durham and the maps are there I

00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,670
found like the thing I noticed when I

00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,210
pulled this map up this week was wow

00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:23,610
there's a lot of red alright and I'm

00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,960
gonna show you the table back to DOM now

00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,280
and show you the rest of the data what

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,040
we know is that stuff that happened in

00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:34,620
1937 affects everything about how cities

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:36,810
are constructed today so that's the

00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,900
grading later on the maps in Durham

00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:42,030
let's look at this is the Chetty map it

00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,330
doesn't in many places the exactly map

00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:47,280
match here they don't because two things

00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:49,050
happened in Durham and I don't know the

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,630
history of Birmingham well enough to

00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:54,000
know like in 1916 there was a big urban

00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,530
renewal project in Durham and there was

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,120
a place like the Wall Street of the

00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,740
south the black Wall Street the South

00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,270
was in Durham North Carolina

00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,100
and they raised it and put a highway

00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:04,619
through it and so there was a place

00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:09,150
where there was a thriving neighborhood

00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:10,650
that that gave folks a lot of Economic

00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,869
Opportunity and that neighborhood got

00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,340
moved down but and I Drive on highway

00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:15,090
every day I had no idea till I put this

00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,920
talk together

00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,450
and now I don't know what to do kiss I

00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,390
don't really want to go around but I

00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,460
feel bad every time I Drive on 147 by

00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,860
the ballpark so that was one thing oh no

00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,990
I never changed the you know is an

00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:31,440
additional influence on top of the 1937

00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:34,190
greetings the other one is that in the

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,920
1970s finally under court order during

00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:39,990
desegregated school system and all the

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,820
white people who lived in town did not

00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:44,960
want their kids to go into school with

00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:47,700
black kids and so what they did was they

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,470
cleverly got around segregation the

00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,970
desegregation was by making a separate

00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:55,680
school system for the city and the

00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:57,590
county and so there were lots of white

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,150
people moved outside the city limits

00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:01,920
where they could then buy property and

00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,430
so they reinforced the segregation so

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,650
the city center became much more

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,900
minority african-american and the the

00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,270
county became much whiter as a whole and

00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:16,500
so those influences change how this map

00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:19,380
looks a little bit but despite that

00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:23,850
despite those changes we can look at

00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:26,460
income and who lives where right now and

00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:30,410
compare it to those gradings from 1939

00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:35,190
for example things that were graded a in

00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:37,650
1937 sorry in 1937 85 percent of the

00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:41,310
people living in a zone now that was

00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:44,750
great a in 1937 or in the middle to

00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:44,750
upper income level

00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:59,590
all right somewhere so today in that

00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:11,350
areas that were graded in 1937 they are

00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:13,840
15% quote minority whatever that is like

00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:17,260
what happened then that's it's like

00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:19,090
today's destiny and I'm sure if you can

00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,650
get the same date and other credits at

00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,360
the end if you look at that

00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:25,840
Birmingham I'm sure you'll see some more

00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:28,990
things all right mr. Chetty um this is

00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:32,110
an area map for rather that's that's

00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:33,760
done so I've zoomed out some that's

00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:36,310
Chapel Hill where the University of

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,700
North Carolina is this is Raleigh the

00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:48,000
capital and that's suburb of Raleigh

00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:53,260
called Cary I currently live right there

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,200
where the aliens would choose all right

00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:59,530
so outside of my college years I have

00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:02,430
almost never rented I bought the first

00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:04,750
house I ever owned in 1980 there it is

00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:06,460
these are today's pictures and Google

00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:10,000
Maps that tree was not there but there's

00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:13,390
a house back there I promise then how

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,820
has he to go to college she works I had

00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:16,960
a real job by the time I bought this

00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:19,720
that's that's a much nicer house in the

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,160
picture makes it look like this is my

00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,010
first house in Durham there's a house

00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:26,260
back there you cannot make the Google

00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:29,410
Maps driver get a good real estate photo

00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:31,300
of your house so that was in 1981 then I

00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:34,960
briefly moved to western Colorado this

00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:37,300
is my house in Grand Junction and then I

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:41,320
moved back to this is the house I lived

00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:43,590
in in 1999 and then I finally bought a

00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:47,650
lot and had a house designed and built

00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:49,390
and this picture was taken actually I

00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,640
bought this lot in 2005 it took two

00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:53,170
years to get the house built my house is

00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,640
not that house or this house it's the

00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:58,660
house at the end of this driveway that

00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:02,920
you can barely see and so that just it's

00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:05,890
back there that's it you can see

00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:08,470
that cohousing you can see this hot

00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:10,720
water solar panels on the roof

00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:12,130
we actually like I said moved in in 2007

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,609
you can see that there's not even a bush

00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:17,859
here I I was threatened my partner moves

00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:19,839
a little bit house-proud threatened me

00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:21,099
if I showed you mean so I took some this

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,770
is what it looks like from the standing

00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:24,700
at that same point today if I walk up

00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,680
the driveway a little bit there's a

00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,710
little garden which I have nothing to do

00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:33,010
with because there's bees I have nothing

00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:34,660
to do with the bees this is on up toward

00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:36,880
the house so this is a beautiful house

00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,440
it's in a super safe neighborhood it's

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,089
passive solar the actually the photo

00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,589
takes you just got hooked up last week

00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,549
so now I'm not paying for electricity

00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:43,990
anymore

00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:46,390
I have solar hot water which means you

00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:47,770
can take the longest hot bath on anyone

00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,099
or night that you want guilt-free hot

00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:56,410
water from the Sun this is the west wall

00:46:51,099 --> 00:47:00,730
so that south wall is total glass it's

00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:02,950
super safe and really nice and I'm so

00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:04,240
lucky to get the live there and the

00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:06,280
reason I get the habit was because I had

00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,290
all those houses before because the

00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,280
equity that I earned in those other

00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:13,900
houses and so if neighborhoods have a

00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,660
lot to do with outcomes but you can't

00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:19,089
pick your neighborhood and only

00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:21,579
properties that path the wealth but you

00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:26,859
can't buy a house then you don't get

00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:31,480
this that sucks and I kind of hate

00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:33,970
knowing all this like I've been

00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,859
obviously successful or not I was really

00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,180
happy before I started making this stock

00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:40,059
I was really happy that I could just

00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:42,160
think of myself as lucky and it turns

00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:45,520
out that once I started looking at the

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:49,240
source of my good fortune it turned out

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:52,299
that it might a scary proportion of my

00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:56,020
luck might have originated from biases

00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:58,210
in the system it wasn't just that people

00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:01,559
could work equally as hard as I've

00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:03,760
worked and not accomplish nearly as much

00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:06,730
now everything I've told you so far on

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,130
this talk it's happened before I was

00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:11,230
born and so I feel like I can tell you I

00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:14,230
can feel safe about saying it's not my

00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,290
fault but I'm going to tell you a few

00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:23,420
more things that

00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:26,120
happened in my lifetime like this how is

00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:33,200
it that the top 1% of people in America

00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:38,120
now owned more than the bottom eet how

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:43,610
is it that 400 people in America on more

00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:48,230
than the bottom 150 million and when did

00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:51,020
we get more like China and Russia then

00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,550
like France and Great Britain and I look

00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:58,820
at this chart and I want to know what

00:48:52,550 --> 00:49:00,530
happened in 1980 and it's this this is

00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:05,330
an idea neoliberalism it's an idea that

00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:07,820
the market is better at arranging things

00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:09,920
than people now this is a not before

00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,050
don't freak out this is not related to

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,550
political ideology like these are a

00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,710
presidents of different political

00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,540
persuasions who all believed in the idea

00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:21,130
of neoliberalism it's something that

00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:24,230
economists sort of tried to talk us into

00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:26,390
and after 40 years of the neoliberal

00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:30,530
liberalism experiment I think it's been

00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:33,350
a disaster for the United States had a

00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:36,550
new book unbound goes through the data

00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:39,110
and terrifyingly readable detail

00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:41,030
liberalism is a contention that markets

00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:43,340
will self-regulate if they're left

00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:45,680
unmanaged but there's a bunch of data

00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:47,990
now that shows that there are many areas

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,990
where manage markets are fairer and more

00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:54,260
efficient than unmanaged ones and she uh

00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:59,150
she argues that these unmanaged markets

00:49:54,260 --> 00:50:01,760
are equally bad across the you know

00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:04,130
they're bad for everybody it's not like

00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,830
some people benefit like everybody loses

00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:09,170
under the unmanaged markets thing and so

00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:11,240
here's the deal it's easy it was easy to

00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:14,360
turn managed markets into unmanaged once

00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:17,600
you just privatize stuff you sell it to

00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:22,280
people you give it to companies the

00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:25,310
problem is well it's it's easy to do

00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,890
it's really hard to take back because

00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,779
the privatization of

00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:32,079
things that are public goods means that

00:50:28,779 --> 00:50:34,059
people amass enormous fortunes and once

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:38,200
they have them they don't really want

00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:40,660
things to change back the super-rich are

00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,920
quite happy with the current system as

00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,880
it is and they have the power now to

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,519
keep it that way

00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,650
and over the last 40 years a bunch of

00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:49,420
stuff that mattered to all of us has

00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:51,400
really gone downhill and I'm gonna just

00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:54,760
give you four examples there are many

00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,769
more here's the first one on the high

00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:00,010
school class of 1975 don't even try to

00:50:56,769 --> 00:51:03,339
do that math I went to school here this

00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:04,809
is a PHS and West Virginia it's on the

00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:07,240
National Register of Historic Places

00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:10,510
when I went to school there you can take

00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:13,420
French Latin German or Spanish I took a

00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,950
bunch of AP courses I sang in an

00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,779
acapella choir that was the best in the

00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,250
nation none of those things are true

00:51:16,779 --> 00:51:19,930
well it's still in the National Register

00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,309
of Historic Places but they don't have

00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:23,069
the funding to do all this things like

00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:26,440
that the quality of the public education

00:51:23,069 --> 00:51:28,420
like my path to here started with the

00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,460
public education I got there and that's

00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:34,900
no longer happening for kids who go to

00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:38,559
school there this is the spending per

00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:41,589
student by school district again red is

00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:44,740
worse now this just shows you this I

00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:46,960
think this is 2016 data it just shows

00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:48,430
you relative to other places what it

00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,099
doesn't tell you is even that is not

00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:53,710
enough money but given the green colors

00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:57,369
are not actually enough but you can look

00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:59,019
here and think of something about what

00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:01,269
outcomes are gonna what look like for

00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:03,700
children some of you those have you done

00:52:01,269 --> 00:52:06,940
proper yet may not know that schools are

00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,170
paid for very often by property taxes so

00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,000
if you live in a crappy neighborhood

00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:12,160
where people rent the schools are going

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,690
to be bad it's just the way it is and

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:18,119
that you can see that you can see

00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,119
property values reflected on this map

00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,710
generations of children are suffering

00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:28,210
under this under the scheme okay nothing

00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:30,190
men on wage on this chart the dark

00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,900
purple is actual dollar amount the light

00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:35,049
purple is what it is in today's dollars

00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:39,790
I last made minimum wage right there

00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:43,060
lucky me okay it turns out that's about

00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:45,070
1080 in today's book you the living wage

00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:47,410
where I live for a single / a single

00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:50,320
adult no children it's 12:15 you could

00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:52,420
almost make it two adults sharing a

00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,960
household making minimum wage if that

00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:58,030
were minimum wage they can survive you

00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:08,340
just you can't make a living on that I

00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:10,960
won't do it next health care these are

00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,790
these are uninsured rates darker colors

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,320
are worse

00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:19,120
the average almost 10% of the people in

00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,800
America do not even have health

00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,660
insurance

00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:28,350
two years ago my partner was diagnosed

00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:31,780
with breast cancer in that year we spent

00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:36,670
$30,000 out-of-pocket for a course of

00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:38,380
treatment that cost $100,000 the average

00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,730
median risen I'm sorry I said average

00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:43,630
but I did mean the meaning income in

00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:46,450
America is what $31,000 two-thirds of

00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:47,680
our bankruptcies in the United States or

00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:49,780
because of medical expenses either

00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,260
directly because of expenses or because

00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:55,300
of lost wages due to illnesses class 1

00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:58,420
some of you're probably still doing this

00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,890
student loan debt when you reduce

00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,960
funding for colleges and universities

00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:05,440
that means there are fewer seats and

00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:08,800
they're more expensive and privatization

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,120
happens when that happens students have

00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,830
to get loans to go to for-profit

00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:17,890
colleges and those loans are of course

00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:20,320
insured by us despite the fact that

00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:21,520
well-educated populous is good for

00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,610
everybody it's good for the whole

00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:27,510
country getting a degree today often

00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:29,770
means taking on crippling debt I

00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:31,750
borrowed money when I was in college

00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:34,270
like I don't even I can tell you this I

00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:36,760
don't remember how much and I don't

00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:38,290
remember what my payments were and I

00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,370
don't remember how long it took to pay

00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:40,750
it off but what I do remember is I

00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:42,970
bought that first house while I was

00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:45,100
paying off my student loan it could've

00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:47,080
been that bad all right it was a

00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:51,000
reasonable amount it wasn't it wasn't a

00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:52,569
life-changing amount of debt today

00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,809
almost a quart

00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:58,890
the adults younger than 60 have student

00:54:55,809 --> 00:55:01,390
loan debts and they're paying this

00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:03,839
rather than doing things that will build

00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:08,739
wealth their me paying these loans

00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:10,989
alright so the history of housing in

00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:13,269
America makes it obvious that the

00:55:10,989 --> 00:55:14,079
American Dream isn't for everyone was

00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:17,109
never available

00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:19,599
it wasn't that's a myth but what has

00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:21,459
happened in the last 40 years has made

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,829
that dream be increasingly out of reach

00:55:21,459 --> 00:55:26,829
for anyone and we've increasingly become

00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:31,329
a society of winners and losers and

00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:34,479
winners as a non gildo says I'm taking

00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:35,949
all and now we get to the point

00:55:34,479 --> 00:55:40,869
those are winners he's talking about

00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:42,969
many of them are in tech it's us wealth

00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:44,559
has become so concentrated in the United

00:55:42,969 --> 00:55:46,209
States it's the super-rich have piles of

00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,769
money and one of the psychological

00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:50,160
effects of having piles of something is

00:55:47,769 --> 00:55:53,169
you begin to believe you deserve it you

00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:55,209
begin to believe that you're special you

00:55:53,169 --> 00:55:57,309
have a right to it and if you're super

00:55:55,209 --> 00:56:00,759
rich you must also be super capable and

00:55:57,309 --> 00:56:03,669
super smart me and it becomes easy

00:56:00,759 --> 00:56:06,400
perhaps even necessary to believe that

00:56:03,669 --> 00:56:09,329
you deserve it and that you begin to

00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:13,329
discount the role played by look and

00:56:09,329 --> 00:56:14,890
opportunity in your success folks in the

00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:17,049
top tier of wealth in the United States

00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:19,119
donate enormous sums of money to

00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:21,039
charitable organizations in an attempt

00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,890
to sort of SAP the piece out of the pain

00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,019
of the have-nots but they generally do

00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:27,699
not use their power and influence to

00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:30,069
change to champion the kinds of change

00:56:27,699 --> 00:56:31,319
that would turn those have-nots into

00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:34,209
halves

00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:36,969
Jared I suggested that whenever the rich

00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:39,369
to fund special programs that give

00:56:36,969 --> 00:56:40,839
teachers extra pay that instead we need

00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:45,039
a rich to fund programs that teach

00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:47,229
teachers how to organize public funding

00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,819
public education funding is broken and

00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:51,969
the people that know how to fix it other

00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:53,319
people that do it they actual the people

00:56:51,969 --> 00:56:55,779
who are working in those schools the

00:56:53,319 --> 00:56:58,689
super-rich are finally doing good but

00:56:55,779 --> 00:57:02,289
they adamantly resist the idea that they

00:56:58,689 --> 00:57:04,329
should instead do less harm we have the

00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:04,980
powerful fighting to change the world in

00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:07,740
ways that

00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:11,670
essentially keep it the same or maybe

00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:14,369
even make it worse how did us ask two

00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:17,540
questions are we ready to hand over our

00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:20,369
future to the elite was supposedly

00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:23,820
world-changing initiative at a time or

00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:26,340
is mournful democracy in which we all

00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:32,550
potentially have our voice worth

00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:36,060
fighting for I am almost done and I

00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:38,580
suspect I behaved like I really did I

00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:40,859
promise I just sat down and make it talk

00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:43,350
a cheerful little talk about being lucky

00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:44,760
and the problem is I started doing

00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:48,330
research and look what I found

00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,800
alright and throughout this research the

00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:52,080
whole time I was following the line for

00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,550
block into neighborhoods how

00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,560
neighborhoods determine outcome and then

00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:57,000
how Red Lion chose neighborhoods to

00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,770
Brundage's and home ownership and wealth

00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
and rental prices and the evictions and

00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:02,070
all kinds of stuff I didn't even talk to

00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,900
him about the whole time I was ringing

00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:12,570
all this stuff I kept hearing myself say

00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:16,650
that's not my fault I didn't do it all

00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:18,930
around a certain age the trouble is it

00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:23,570
wasn't in real life I'm someone telling

00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:23,570
me I could legitimately say ok bummer

00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:29,400
and I thought I was just hardworking and

00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:31,950
lucky but now I have to learn it if I've

00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,670
spent my entire life surfing the final

00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:38,970
crest of the last wave of the American

00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:41,130
dream I don't have to turn this into a

00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:42,570
place where a few people make piles of

00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:45,480
money of lots of folks get thrown into

00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:47,340
jail that evicted from their homes take

00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,830
on a corona / to get yours less

00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:51,720
educational credentials go to crappy

00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:53,940
public schools can't get a job that pays

00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:56,040
a decent wage unless everything if they

00:58:53,940 --> 00:59:01,190
get sick and live in a world that is

00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:05,700
simultaneously drowning and on fire I

00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:08,030
didn't have to do it but I stood by and

00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,030
let it happen

00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:16,670
I think I need to beg your most humble

00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:16,670
pardon for the world that we live in you

00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:25,350
[Music]

00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:30,630
make it it's gonna be on our head to fix

00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:33,690
it so what should you do

00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:37,290
all right here it is pay attention to

00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:39,240
your complicity it doesn't matter that

00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:42,420
you didn't do it if you're benefiting

00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:44,400
from biases in the system pay attention

00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:48,710
to that and acknowledge is the truth of

00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:53,190
it it is what it is take responsibility

00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:56,030
give back where you can this means like

00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:59,220
I promise you I up my charitable giving

00:59:56,030 --> 01:00:00,930
I'm a big Habitat for Humanity fan but I

00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:03,270
also found another place that does

01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,980
housing for homeless folks tries to get

01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:07,650
people off the street and into housing

01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:10,230
and I have like I actually I probably

01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:13,010
giving by order of magnitude and you

01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:15,990
probably should too

01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:18,090
also down the best tech you can right

01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:20,160
where it's possible make a decisions

01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:22,560
there all right but these are things

01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:28,140
that you can do personally I want you

01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:32,720
also to think bigger need solutions that

01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:36,840
are public Democratic Universal and

01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:39,620
institutional if you were born after

01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,620
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:48,180
you spent your whole life listening to

01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:50,670
the news saying the scariest in the

01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:54,930
English language is I'm here to help you

01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:57,720
I promise you the last 40 years have

01:00:54,930 --> 01:01:04,410
shown us that in truth they are far

01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:07,620
scarier things in a democracy the

01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:09,630
government we need a tax code it fixes

01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:09,920
in a wealth gap and say to the middle

01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:13,050
class

01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,000
we've federal housing programs that give

01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:17,430
everyone a chance at common ownership

01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,980
we need to fourth we deal with our

01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:21,540
legacy as a slave nation and consider I

01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,430
never thought I would say this but I

01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:28,740
know too much now we need to consider

01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:31,410
reparations we need empowered workers

01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:35,010
that can bring balance to this loan a

01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:41,180
form of capitalism we follow him United

01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:44,400
States and over stop climate change yo

01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:48,630
are the smartest and the brightest and

01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:54,140
the best and you were also the luckiest

01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:58,080
and the most amply rewarded I trust you

01:01:54,140 --> 01:02:00,810
to transform the system into something

01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:03,330
that works for all of us and it's not

01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:06,660
going to be easy and it's not gonna

01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:10,880
happen by itself so you need to go get

01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:10,880
busy thank you

01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,120
