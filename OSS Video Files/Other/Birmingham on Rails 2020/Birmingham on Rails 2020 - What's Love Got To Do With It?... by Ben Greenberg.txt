[Music]

00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,210
[Music]

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,210
[Applause]

00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:25,289
[Music]

00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:27,510
yeah how's your day been so far I see

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,359
that thumbs up I see a great for nods

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,980
it's three o'clock I know it's that time

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,290
of the day so I'll try and do a little

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,820
more energetic that normal I just had

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,879
another cup of coffee I'm only on number

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,800
seven so I think we'll be okay I'm gonna

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,800
take taking the last cup of coffee from

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,559
the urn I apologize so we're gonna talk

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,570
about Ruby and sentiment analysis what's

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,780
love what's hatred

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,520
what's anger what's joy what sadness

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,250
what's it got to do with it right

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,739
creative title but before we get started

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,629
on that one who I am so as mentioning

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,949
has been I'm a second career develop

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,140
right here the second career developers

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,610
here any bootcamp people psyche new

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,080
developers yeah so I spent a decade as a

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,479
rabbi at a community organizer

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,430
throughout the US you move around that

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,860
often even if you're working in the

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,340
military or in the clergy so I'm using

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,130
the ladder and I lived in San Diego New

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,570
York City Boston and Denver I've seen a

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,580
lot of different expressions of

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,229
sentiment and the way people spread

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,229
their sentiment and Mercia Valatie in

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,200
the US and I now and outside Tel Aviv in

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,840
Israel and I am a developer advocate and

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,610
next mode the varnish API platform we

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,320
have a suite of cloud communications API

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,759
platforms you might have seen my

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,700
stickers I've been throwing around on

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,829
the tables and coupon cards and we have

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,840
a great ruby gem I maintain it I think

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,079
it's pretty awesome and so that's a

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,630
little about who I am what are we gonna

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,380
do today together so we're gonna do a

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,060
few things

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,740
well first gonna take a bit of a

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,060
high-level approach and trying to

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:06,130
understand why this entire conversation

00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:09,369
matters why is it important that we even

00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:12,489
in the contours and sort of the shape of

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:14,140
human language why should we even invest

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,160
the time in that so to do that we're

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,430
going to take a little bit of an

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,830
adventure into linguistics and so the

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,440
nature of human language little bit of a

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,660
detour from coding and more into did a

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,760
type of coded the coding of our thoughts

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,680
in the ways in which we speak to each

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,690
other and then from now we're going to

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,849
talk about it in the balcony perspective

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,610
around what is natural language

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,560
processing what is happening what are

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,780
the rules that inform the algorithms

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,370
that perform those tasks and then as a

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,410
subset of that what specifically a

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,269
sentiment now this is and then we're

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,760
going to say well now that we know what

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:51,130
these things are what can I actually do

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,780
with it what can I build with it to give

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,849
some insight in the world that we live

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,260
in and lastly we're going to build it

00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:58,569
because that's we're gonna do together

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,519
and build something and then we're going

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,530
to run it and then analyze the data and

00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,019
understand where what cousins back to us

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,760
from these analysis and take a deep dive

00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,790
into that actual data that we get back

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,579
does that sound good yeah okay so let's

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,609
actually get started we've got that big

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:17,590
question that huge question why does

00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,239
this matter why should I not just walk

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,230
out of here and get smart candy from the

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,750
sponsor out there

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,130
why should I actually focus on their

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,660
Valentine's candy by the way so they're

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,380
pretty good but why should I actually

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,569
focus on this subject so to answer that

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,480
question we actually have to start with

00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:38,079
a pretty big claim and that claim is

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,859
that language human language is not only

00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:45,040
a passive vehicle for information and

00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:48,880
what I mean by that is that language is

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,180
more than the conveyance of point a from

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,120
person X to person Y a pure transmission

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,239
of data language has to be something

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,980
more than that language itself shapes

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,230
the ways in which we think it shapes the

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,010
Rays and what we think we ought to think

00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,690
about that makes sense and I'm going to

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,609
give you just a couple quick examples

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,459
before we get into the rest of our

00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:17,250
conversation together so one example is

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,380
might what might happen as a

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,299
the cold water cooler conversation

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,680
between you and your panda friends and

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,300
you were standing around the water

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,930
cooled and you save your panda friends

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,890
last night I had dinner with someone it

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,960
was delicious

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:35,370
pretty simple English sentence right not

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,890
so complicated not super uber complex I

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,770
had dinner with someone a human being

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,590
and that dinner it was what the Internet

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,110
sentence their dinner right the dinner

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,120
was delicious what I'm choosing to

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,800
reveal because as an English speaker

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,530
what I'm choosing not to reveal is

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,930
guided by the rules of the language that

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,030
I'm employing right so another example

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,410
that exact same sentence is a language

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,080
you might not even know what that is

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:04,260
what is that that's not Klingon that is

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,940
Hebrew and so Hebrew like other many

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,720
other languages in the world German

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,730
Italian Russian French etc etc etc etc

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,490
do things a little differently so that

00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,110
sentence would say and I'm gonna be for

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:21,740
you in English last night I had dinner

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:23,960
with a male someone and she was

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,240
delicious

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,950
why do I need to do that because what do

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,750
many languages in the world have which

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,950
English does not and used to by the way

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,000
in the evolution of English but no

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:37,979
longer does gender masculine and

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,370
feminine assignments for proper named

00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:44,190
entities right so dinner uh-huh

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,560
and Hebrew is a feminine word there is

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,229
no such thing as its you can't say

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,620
something isn't it it is either a he or

00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,900
a she

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,520
so referring to the thing by not

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,060
referring to advise me and to think I

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,950
have to say the she she with delicious

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:03,120
furthermore there is no such thing as a

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:05,580
someone what is this someone you are a

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,870
male sub whether a female someone there

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,750
is no non-gendered person so in that way

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,970
I in the water cooler talk have to

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,210
actually reveal to my panda colleague

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:21,390
the gender identity of the person that

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,330
I'm having that I had dinner with that

00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:27,020
may or may not be more or less than I

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:30,050
want to tell that person because

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,729
nuance there right some of the things

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,710
might shift if I say I have dinner with

00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,289
a female someone or a male someone is

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,940
different than you say as someone

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:40,250
because the rules of the language again

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,830
changed the contours of what we have to

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:47,930
actually think about and one last

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:50,539
example is how we see ourselves in the

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,409
world our place in the world of their

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:56,449
physical selves so if I were I telling

00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,650
you how to get to the coffee shop down

00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,800
the street from the McWane Science

00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,930
Center and I'm a speaker of English I

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,810
might say something to you like you go

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,520
out the door pass the popcorn stand on

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,830
your right and don't buy any popcorn

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,110
because it's not good for you and then

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,580
make the left and then another left and

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,990
then a right and it's right in front of

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,590
you that sounds pretty reasonable right

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:21,110
but if I speak a language that thinks of

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,389
myself and all of us in a different

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,240
context as far as what was situated in

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,770
the world I will say something like you

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,490
go out the door go north

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:33,080
then take a West another West and then

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,840
it's at southeast and it's right there

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,080
in the southeast corner and the people

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,449
who speak those languages actually at

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,909
all times understand the cardinal

00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:45,770
directions around them where north is

00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:47,930
where East is where West is where South

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,880
is and a great example of that would be

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,610
if I take my index finger and I point to

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,009
my in this way and I just correct myself

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,750
because it's so obvious I point in this

00:07:55,009 --> 00:08:05,840
way what am i doing I'm pointing to

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:07,789
myself pay attention to me I'm here if

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,560
you're a speaker one of these geocentric

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:12,229
languages what are you doing you point

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,690
this way you're pointing throughly

00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,840
yourself you're pointing to the cardinal

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:20,360
direction behind you and this is all to

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,419
say that language does more than convey

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,000
information language helps shape the way

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:28,759
we understand and see the world language

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,800
itself as a medium is a tool that helps

00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,329
us think about what we ought to think

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,219
about and how we are ought to think

00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:36,169
about how we authorize on English how we

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,300
ought to think about things because

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,990
language is ultimately a conduit

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,020
construc

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,420
sir an understanding language helps us

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,580
in understanding the world that we live

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,370
in if you think about our world as a

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,740
society of a human society it is shaped

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,260
by the words that we are inundated with

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,149
the words that I create the word that

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,640
you create the words that we all create

00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,890
together and understanding those words

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,370
helps us understand the world we live in

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:06,260
and algorithms natural language

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,750
processing can help us in getting to

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,880
that level of understanding so then my

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,750
friends what is natural language

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,180
understanding what is this tool that we

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,630
have in front of us and as a subset of

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,089
it what is sentiment analysis so to

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,459
answer that question we turn to Alan

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:27,649
Turing feel familiar with Alan Turing

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,230
the Turing test is something really

00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:32,690
intelligent as a thinking or not Alan

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,130
Turing prophesied you know he was a

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:38,540
prophet I didn't know either he

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:42,020
prophesized that by 1999 what alien now

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:45,410
2020 by 1999 we would look at the two

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:48,890
words machine and thinking the

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:52,160
juxtaposition of the two and not see a

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,600
contradiction between them we will look

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,490
at a machine we're looking at this

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,589
MacBook this beautiful MacBook with that

00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,480
touch bar which is kind of annoying and

00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:04,660
you look at that machine and you would

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:07,810
say that machine thinks are we there yet

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,850
that's the question are we there yet

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:14,600
because what does it mean to think in a

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,640
human context you imagine thinking in

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,680
many different contexts but within a

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,750
human context you can imagine that

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,620
thinking is understanding the

00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:28,279
ambiguities the nuances the complexities

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:32,230
the contradictions of human language so

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:34,610
you can understand the ways we

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,870
understand ourselves you can understand

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,000
the ways we understand ourselves and

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,589
understand others you might be able to

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,200
articulate the idea that you are

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,990
thinking it's not the only way to assess

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,390
thinking but it is a one possibility

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,699
so within natural language analysis

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,990
let's take that sentence that we had

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,770
before last night I had dinner with

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,140
someone

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,340
and this is a sample of data you would

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,680
get back from a natural language

00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,960
analyzer on that sentence you would get

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,750
back things like the sentiment score the

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,210
semantic roles the keywords emotional

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,820
scoring and categories right so under

00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:10,820
semantic roles receiving an analyzer was

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:13,010
able to identify that the subject was I

00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,690
that the sentence is able to pick out

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,920
and see the full continuous sentence and

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,290
the object was dinner

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,400
the road was have and it was conjugated

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,730
in the past tense

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:25,880
I had dinner there for my keywords in

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:29,000
this very complex sentence not were last

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,540
night and dinner last night primarily

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,220
and dinner secondarily tertiary right my

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,000
primary intention is telling you what I

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,640
did last night

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,560
and secondarily what I did was I had I

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,360
had dinner and went to the food hall was

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,550
really good and then I then went home

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,730
that's that is essentially what's

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:49,730
happening in this analysis so how do we

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,310
actually process that how do we get to

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,930
that kind of data we get to that data by

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:57,170
employing a bunch of different rules

00:11:53,930 --> 00:12:01,190
from English language from languages in

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:03,800
general structures so for example so

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:07,990
things like formal grammar inflectional

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,410
endings so for example if the police

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,350
know okay

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:15,560
if the police helps dog is it working I

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:19,370
was working police helps dog bite victim

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,500
versus police help dog bite victim very

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,600
different intentions between those two

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,000
things inflectional endings really

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,590
matter is part of the rules that's great

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,990
is that what the way those were the way

00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,550
all right that was really good

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:34,520
inflectional endings parts of speech

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,860
tagging parsing sentences the root forms

00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,110
of words taking the relationships of

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,660
main entities of who to whom what to

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,370
what and the different probabilities of

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,890
the meanings of any particular word

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,180
because any one word in many different

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,430
languages can mean different things

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,110
depending on the context and the

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,580
algorithm needs to score the likelihood

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,870
of different probabilities of that

00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,000
meaning to be really understand that

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,670
sentence so all these things and there's

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,430
so many more come into play with mine to

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,200
understands and analyze human language

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,750
but that's understanding human language

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,210
visa

00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,510
things like its semantic roles the

00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:12,450
grammar the objects the categories how

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:15,420
do we get to things around um polarity

00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:17,760
and things around sentiment analysis we

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,880
get to that by trying to then understand

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,400
the emotionality of a sentence and one

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,130
of the primary tools understand

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,080
emotionality is a concept called

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:30,090
polarity polarity really means right

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,010
what does polarity mean the extremes

00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,990
between two things right and so

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:38,010
happiness what the extreme of happiness

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:41,220
the other extreme tired

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,440
happiness sadness anger joy things like

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,930
that and so the algorithms have to be

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,460
trained to understand the polarity in a

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,220
sentence as well so maybe these three

00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,350
examples in order of difficulty of

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,330
understanding the polarity you can help

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,350
me score these things so the first

00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:00,690
example I dislike broken cars but the

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:04,080
polarity of I dislike broken cars with

00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:08,670
the scoring it's probably a little angry

00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:11,070
upset discontent I just like broken cars

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,510
it's easy that's super easy for an

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,080
algorithm to process the polarity of

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,910
that let's take another example I really

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,370
truly love going out in this weather

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,950
what's the polarity of that well it

00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,780
could be to one of two things it's sunny

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,360
outside it's a beautiful day let's go

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,040
see the Vulcan statue it's amazing I

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,670
really truly love going out in this

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,240
weather or I really truly love going out

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:39,180
and this woman it's raining outside you

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,220
don't want to go outside it's gross you

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,440
know and Tel Aviv if it rains the entire

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,960
city shuts down you don't want to go out

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,660
in that kind of weather and so that's

00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,560
sarcasm how does the algorithm

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:56,390
understand sarcasm does anyone know

00:14:51,560 --> 00:15:01,530
what's the primary I understand sarcasm

00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:05,190
context what is sarcasm except for its

00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:07,620
context that's what defines a sarcastic

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,000
comments context because when it's

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,920
written you can't get the inflectional

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,410
endings right you have to get it from

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,430
its larger context and the last one

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,860
which really just

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:22,029
as for a loop every time is the

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:23,740
following I love my mobile this is

00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:26,350
written for a British audience of cell

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,430
phone I love my mobile but would not

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:33,520
recommend it to any of my colleagues

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:35,910
what's good on there I love my cell

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,830
phone but I wouldn't tell you to get it

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:41,560
what's the plan with the scoring of that

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,720
sentence is it a happy sentence I'm

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,790
really joyful I got the new Google pixel

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,980
phone and it's amazing or is it oh my

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,589
gosh I got the Google pixel phone and I

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,020
liked it but you would you're not free

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:55,510
you particularly here in iOS person you

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,339
should you stupid iOS and so where does

00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,339
it come from well the problem with

00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:03,850
sentences like that is that they are

00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:05,290
contradictory but and the problem for

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:09,399
algorithms is how to score a

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:11,890
contradiction and that my friends yields

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,810
a huge issue because this may come as a

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,970
huge shock it came as a huge shock to me

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:18,730
I'll tell you this people are

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,730
contradictory we make contradictory

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,620
statements we don't always make sense I

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,870
know that's like outlandish ly crazy

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,020
that we don't always make sense what we

00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,850
don't and so if we want understand human

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,550
language and understand the

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,980
sentimentality of human language we have

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,110
to actually understand paradigms like

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,990
that where they are utterly

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,540
contradictory so now that we have a bit

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,830
of a balcony perspective really need a

00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,050
balcony there because he's so much more

00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,360
he's an entire day on natural language

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,830
processing let's think about what we can

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,240
build with it so what we can go with it

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,220
I'd be a little self-interested and

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,580
really build something that would help

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,829
me anyone else like am I the only one

00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,700
who first thing I wake up in the morning

00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:02,980
I check my phone

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,380
does anyone air phone you can admit it's

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,089
a safe space were in right now I see one

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,910
hearing that everyone else your hand

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,870
should be up I know you are and so when

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,419
I checked my phone what do I see that my

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,799
I see news headlines and they can be

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:21,049
really overwhelming those news headlines

00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:23,720
a lot of words and I just want to know

00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:26,270
can as it's safe to get out of bed

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,370
is it safe to get out of bed or should I

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:31,220
pull the covers for another hour and

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:33,140
retreat from this crazy world that's the

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,480
only question I have in the morning

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,650
do I have to well honestly as a parent I

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,260
have to get up I don't have a choice

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:41,480
because you know school and lunches and

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,370
all that stuff but do I have to get up

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,980
or do I not have to get up if you just

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,510
want to know what is the mood of the

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,070
news so that's what we're going to build

00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,840
together a mood of the news application

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,580
and we're going to build this as a

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,470
whatsapp application so the user is

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,940
going to send a topic that they're

00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,980
interested to see whether they should

00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,570
pull up the covers or not that topic

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,480
will then be scoured of all the news

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:04,760
headlines of the day on that topic we'll

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,010
take all of those headlines send them

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,720
for a MLP natural English processing

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,820
analysis and central analysis and

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,559
threaten send it back to the user as

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,799
through whatsapp and when you give us as

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,679
a rails application sound good okay so

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,480
let's do this I say let's build it how

00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,919
you say it get her get her done right

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:28,460
that's done maybe that's a okay get her

00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:31,250
done so we're gonna use me API is to do

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,870
this if you saw it this in the spirit of

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,770
what you can possibly learn from this

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,539
maybe you learned a little bit along

00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,799
with sticks and you haven't thought

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,690
about that before maybe you've never

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,909
worked with an API where he working with

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,710
external API is maybe you haven't built

00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:44,600
a rails application that really doesn't

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,610
have any views and only works about

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,140
about what data transmission and working

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,210
with data different things that

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,100
hopefully will for you interesting in

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,799
this and you can pick out of it what is

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,940
most interesting for you in this talk so

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,840
we're gonna be working with three

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:02,630
external API s the news API IBM Watson

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,730
natural language analyzer and next mode

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,190
message API so news APL will let us

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,260
scour all those headlines the IBM Watson

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,929
we there's other services as well as

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,610
your Google Cloud we're using Watson and

00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:15,230
next mode there's other service as well

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,730
I can't say who they are but you know

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,380
who they are

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,830
that also offer you opportunities a said

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,750
multi-channel

00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,789
Haitians the message API is actually I

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,320
think really cool with just one bit of

00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,480
JSON you can basically send

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,490
communications multi-channel

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,470
communications like Facebook Messenger

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,450
or whatsapp in Europe they use things

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,549
called like viber derivative viber you

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,830
know Vipers viber and all these other

00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,419
things and you can set it all which is

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,179
basically specifying to type in a JSON

00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,440
objects pretty cool and I like all these

00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,470
three one of them because they pay me

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,549
the other two because they and all of

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,980
them because they're generous free

00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:51,510
access tier they all have a ruby SDK

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,880
which i think is critical to you up and

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:57,750
running and documentation documentation

00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:00,299
documentation documentation so important

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,460
good documentation is the tipping point

00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:04,169
of whether I will use it or not use it

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,690
and so they all have good documentation

00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:08,850
so the first thing we need is obviously

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,769
a gem file our gem file has a few

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,149
dependencies we're gonna use the next

00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:14,279
more rails gem which the rails

00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:16,919
initializer basically wraps around the

00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:20,010
Ruby SDK provides you a globally

00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,409
credential instance of the SDK we're

00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,730
going to use the news API gem the IBM

00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:25,679
Watson gem we're going to store our

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,299
credentials in advance we needed gotta

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,649
end rail gem and then we're gonna

00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,210
include a little bit emojis because we

00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:32,220
like them who doesn't like emojis so

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,679
really is like some emoji parsing for

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,110
fun why not and then of course we also

00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,419
need our wraps routes are very important

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,399
in this application you only have two

00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,649
routes because we're not serving any

00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:45,960
views which is basically to post routes

00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:47,730
for bread hooks web hooks are basically

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,490
a way of getting data from an API

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,010
without having to ask for that data all

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:59,580
the time so like in the traditional way

00:20:53,010 --> 00:21:01,350
you'd be like hey I mean for me no no no

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,389
I won't cook is like setting up the

00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,029
route you set it to open to listen and

00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:08,159
the EPA says oh by the way here you go

00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:10,230
and so it's a much cleaner way to

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,330
interact with API is you basically say

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,580
you you contact me with your readily

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,740
yeah I don't need to be reaching out to

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,360
Mary five seconds you you let me know

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,610
when you're ready and we need two routes

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,350
one for inbound web hook and one for

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,880
status updates and they're going to

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,320
reference methods and a news controller

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,970
we're going to create in just a moment

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,220
and then of course who else you need

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,810
environment variables very simple which

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,540
needed places through our API

00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:35,760
an API secrets and along with our next

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,800
one application ID basically saying we

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,720
have this application called a news

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,670
application and we created in our

00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,860
dashboard and so we need an ID and we

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,540
store that as well and our provisioned

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,850
virtual phone number for our whatsapp

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:51,450
messages as whatsapp requires you unlike

00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,200
SMS in the United States I think don't

00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,900
quote me on that

00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,940
many countries whatsapp requires you to

00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,620
have an actual phone number to send and

00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,270
work with whatsapp so you need and

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,440
that's all very complicated process by

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,960
the way together what's that phone

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,220
number it's annoying but that's what it

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,680
means like whatsapp it's not full of

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,720
tons of spam right because of that

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,580
process and then now we're going to go

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,760
into the bulk of our work together which

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:17,490
is the controller there are many

00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,830
different ways to have coded this I am

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,140
doing it and this is full disclosure the

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,490
most simplest way which is a put it all

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,200
inside the controller

00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:27,630
you could have abstracted this out to

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,790
some model methods and all kinds of fun

00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,290
stuff I know you know standing messes

00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,150
here she's like the genius on these sort

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:36,090
of things this is just all in the

00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:38,520
controller it's just just to get get er

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:41,850
done and so it's in the controller and

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,680
basically to define a few methods one is

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,710
an inbound method to reference the

00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,080
inbound route and the other one is the

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,270
status methods reference the status

00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,010
rather already doing the status method

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,540
is we're going to put out those params

00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,090
as they come in the updates to our

00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,920
console so they can see them and we are

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,490
going to add that me turn back to the

00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,350
API HTTP status code of 204 no content

00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:07,440
basically saying your way of saying back

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,490
to the web hook I got the data thank you

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,710
you don't have to keep on sending it to

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,130
me many API is if you don't acknowledge

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,810
the data we'll keep on doing what

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,400
sending it to you over and over and over

00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,200
again until you acknowledge who received

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,510
it so that's very important it's kind of

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,400
like road at this point just say I got

00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:26,250
it thank you even if you don't mean to

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,380
just say it it doesn't hurt and so once

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,260
we have the status method we can move on

00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,210
to the inbound method the inbound method

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,180
is essentially going to do two things

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:38,350
leave my methods going to take the data

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,150
that comes back from the API

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,100
sign it available so we could use it and

00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,750
work with it and it's also going to then

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,789
take those that data that's been

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,490
assigned to variables and pass it to a

00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:50,530
method that we have not yet created that

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,530
will take those variables that did and

00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,900
pass it to the news API if you get those

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,760
headlines and then send it to the

00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,520
central analysis and natural language

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,200
processor to analyze them so we take me

00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,090
what the topic what's the topic the

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,880
topic is the message at the user

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,830
sentence from there what's that message

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,659
if you're building this is a real-time

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,909
production application I'd recommend you

00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,169
validate their data you make sure the

00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,809
data is what you think it's gonna be

00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:18,789
that's he being pretty open there but

00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:20,230
this is just a sample we're not we're

00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:24,220
trusting I'm trusting myself basically

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,299
to not try and hack myself but I guess I

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,539
could do that

00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:31,990
and then the analyze headlines method

00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:33,940
which is going to take prama to topic

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,350
and the recipient passed that in the

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,450
analyze headlines method and again we

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,429
turn it 2 or 4 with any analyze

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,600
headlines method this is where the work

00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:42,850
starts so we're going to create this

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,130
analyze headlines method that's going to

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,080
then take as arguments that topic in the

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,700
recipient number and the first thing we

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:54,490
need to do is actually instantiate an

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:57,340
instance of the IBM Watson Jeff right so

00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,590
that I'm following basically this code

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,929
right here is following what's on their

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,250
documentation because I figure that if

00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:04,990
I'm gonna use something I'm gonna just

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,880
follow whether you say to do with it and

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,289
if it works that way great then I can

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,460
play with it if it doesn't work that way

00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,590
that maybe you raise a PR the

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,299
documentation right and say like what's

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,100
going on here adaptation didn't match

00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:18,309
what you said it would do and you

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,140
basically say okay what an instance of

00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:23,530
the Nou the natural language

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,360
understanding analyzer we have two paths

00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,280
in our API key which we can storing in

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,570
our environment variable and the second

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,789
and this is me figuring out where to put

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:34,000
the single comma or whatever it's called

00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:36,850
the single thing and and then the actor

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,860
passing of version date this date must

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,740
hit I don't work for IBM this date must

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,690
have been seminal in the history of IBM

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,900
2080 November 16th I don't know why but

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,420
that's the date for all time so

00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,760
in there that was huge in 2018 November

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,890
16th that's the API date and we all seem

00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,450
to specify the endpoint because I'm on

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,930
the free tier so I created my account

00:25:54,450 --> 00:26:00,420
FYI on a work trip in Amsterdam and so

00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,920
I'm tied to the London endpoint so

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,260
wherever I am in the world it may not be

00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,260
the most the fastest endpoint to reach

00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,400
but I am now tied to the one closest to

00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,410
Amsterdam which is the London end point

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,440
even though London's not part of Europe

00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:16,350
as of today but whatever and and then so

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,290
we specify that URL and now we've done

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:21,810
that we can now call the analyse method

00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,940
which is an instance method of the gem

00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:25,680
we're gonna take that demon to get back

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,660
from the analyse method and we're gonna

00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,090
store it a nun beautiful beautifully

00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,430
named response variable right very easy

00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:35,610
to know what it is and he want basically

00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:38,670
to analyze the text what is the text the

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:40,500
text is what comes back from a method we

00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:50,760
need to create called news headlines

00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:53,250
which we'll do and we weren't certain

00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,560
data points back from the analysis you

00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,810
can specify as much of the data you want

00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,490
back or has or as little the data that

00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,880
you want back and we're basically saying

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:05,180
give us the entire room for data give us

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,890
everything I want all the entities

00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,590
identifications I want the key words I

00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,600
want the sentiments scoring I want the

00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,640
categories and I want with the

00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,190
categories explanation oftentimes the

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,990
explanation is route bit redundant but

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,270
sometimes it's not sometimes it's just a

00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,230
repeat of the category but every once in

00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,390
a while you actually a little more

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,640
insight and I also want the relations

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,860
between things and I want the semantic

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,300
roles like what's the verb what's the

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,640
conjugated form to the verb is being

00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,020
used in all that kind of stuff and of

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,400
course I also want the emotion what's

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,190
really cool about the emotion by the way

00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,470
is you can specify either I want the

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,200
emotional scoring on the entire thing I

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,530
send in or I'm gonna say I only want the

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,510
emotional scoring on these specific

00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:50,250
strings of text so I'm going to send you

00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,010
this entire thing it's gonna be on the

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,550
second born piece but I only want the

00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:59,010
emotional scoring on the war

00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:01,150
the you mean emotion of the word ah I

00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,730
might tell you that the word thought

00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:06,130
doesn't have a high emotional score but

00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,420
but in this case I'm saying I want the

00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,640
entire emotional scoring the entire

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,020
document and I'm calling dummies

00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,530
alternet which basically says you're

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,020
skinny

00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:16,450
in like beautiful JSON formatted data

00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,940
that I can play with and then we did it

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,530
and that's the result and then the last

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,510
thing you do is actually just get the

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:25,030
news headlines this is relatively

00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,770
straightforward it's a method that takes

00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:29,710
in the topic we instantiate an instance

00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:31,600
the news API and we pass in our API key

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,900
and we say I want the news on that topic

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,070
for everything and I want it only for

00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,960
today because I'm only interested to if

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,550
I to get out of bed today I don't care

00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,400
what happened yesterday I don't know

00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:44,410
what happened happening today and I did

00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,590
this intentionally those different ways

00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:49,150
is sorted I want a sorted by popularity

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:52,870
why do I want to sort of by popularity

00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:55,720
what you think what's the impact of

00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,190
sorting it by popularity you're allowed

00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,500
to talk in Israel we interrupt each

00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:02,170
other it's fine why don't one is sort of

00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,700
by popularity because what am i

00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,130
interested in what's the question I'm

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,240
trying to answer what's the mood and

00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:11,980
what shapes the discourse of the mood

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,650
the number of eyeballs see something

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,180
right the more it's visible the more

00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:20,320
it's prevalent the more it's pervasive

00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:22,630
the more its shaping the mood I can sort

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,600
this by ascending or descending order

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:27,520
alphabet alphabetized I can sort this in

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,400
all sorts of ways I just would have

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,290
sorted by by a number of eyeballs that's

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,840
what I'm actually interested in a cons

00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:36,820
back as an array IBM Watson doesn't like

00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,040
arrays on like strings I make it into a

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,600
string and then I explicitly return it I

00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,730
like explicit return so I always do an

00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,620
explicit return get my data I know what

00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,500
I have and then the last thing we need

00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,940
to do is to send that message that's a

00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,160
lot of text I don't expect you to read

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,070
it I'll send you the github repo at the

00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,370
end that's basically calling this HTTP

00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:59,980
call to the next my messages API

00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:03,070
saying okay I have my URI I want to use

00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,840
SSL as a JSON application type my

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,580
authorization that JWT

00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,700
in which we still need to generate a

00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,139
generate GWT token and I my body is it's

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,360
the from it's a type of a number of

00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:15,399
whatsapp the number I'm sending it from

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,749
is my what's that number the two number

00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:18,370
is the recipient number and then the

00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:20,470
message is the message and it's composed

00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,999
there thank you for contacting rudiment

00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,909
news here's your scoring on the topic

00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:28,360
your interest and last but not least is

00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:31,059
of course the JWT token we generate that

00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,340
using the next Moe SDK passing in our

00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:35,320
application ID in our private key and we

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,240
get back a JSON web token which is what

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,059
we used for authorization to make the

00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,950
HTTP call and then now we're ready to

00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:44,320
actually just give it a go right if I go

00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,059
let's give it a go so what are we going

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,519
to call for we're going to ask for

00:30:46,059 --> 00:31:03,159
programming what's the mood of the news

00:30:48,519 --> 00:31:06,070
for programming what do you think the

00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,299
emotional scoring you see that can you

00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,340
see on the side screen over there as

00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:18,940
well but the emotional scoring what you

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:21,730
see 55% of joy and 46% of anger so an

00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:25,740
emotional schooler most prevalent joy

00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:28,779
and yet what's the sentiment negative

00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,419
this is lesson number one that I had to

00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:33,789
learn emotional scoring and sentiment

00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:39,240
scoring are not exactly the same they

00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:39,240
use different data points in that is

00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:55,539
understand the negativity of the dress

00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:59,289
it's together get in the room you like

00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:01,570
an Oprah moment let's hash it out and so

00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:04,539
to understand that we have to examine

00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:07,389
our data because as developers who one

00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:09,850
understand what did he actually send to

00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:11,919
the API what was the data we sent to get

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,139
that score it might not be what you

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,909
think it was so these are the headlines

00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:19,759
we said to get that score are we

00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:21,499
to couple them for you IBM Microsoft the

00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,899
memory of Odyssey support for Google

00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:25,940
against Oracle Supremes Java API

00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:27,799
copyright case and you know that a

00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,679
little bit further and you see John Rick

00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:32,389
TV show is moving along that's a lot of

00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,429
shooting probably in that show and then

00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:38,269
you go for and we'll further down and

00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:40,429
you see things like sherman 49ers

00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:41,899
turnarounds Wynn improvement has put

00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:44,869
team in exclusive company which is good

00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:46,580
news if you like the 49ers and iOS 13

00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:49,580
point three point one public beta to his

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,349
Bay back after a long hiatus so we

00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,570
looked at these headlines what we

00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:56,119
understand is actually that we have

00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,559
eighteen headlines feminine them are

00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:59,479
related to the topic we were most

00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,070
interested in which meant that thirty

00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:03,440
eight point eight percent of our sample

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,340
directly believe the topic that I cared

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,559
about when I was waking up in the

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,289
morning which tells us we always need to

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,639
examine our data right we're asking for

00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:12,320
something we think we know we're getting

00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:13,729
we're actually not getting exactly what

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,989
we think we're getting but we are

00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:17,359
getting thirty eight point eight percent

00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:19,970
of what we think we're getting so that's

00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:23,090
the big big point there is an examine

00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,649
your data check your assumptions don't

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,229
assume what you're asking for is what

00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:28,970
you get now furthermore if we then take

00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:31,309
a little bit of a dive into the actual

00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,139
analysis of that data well we as we

00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:36,830
mentioned a sentiment was negative for

00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:39,590
the square of negative 0.62 and the

00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:42,139
emotional results were fifty six fifty

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:45,019
five percent fifty five four fifty five

00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:47,029
percent joy and 46 percent anger with

00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:49,489
some other things in there as well so

00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:52,700
why the discrepancy between those two

00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:54,409
things why do we have that seemingly big

00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,379
discrepancy between a negative sentiment

00:33:54,409 --> 00:34:00,830
and yet fifty five percent positive

00:33:57,379 --> 00:34:03,080
emotion with a close seconds of not such

00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,210
a positive emotion so to understand that

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,309
we need to take a look at what were the

00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,500
concepts identified remember that in the

00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:11,119
initial data we looked at about I had

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,129
dinner with somebody last night sentence

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,379
and it came back that last night and

00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:18,169
dinner were the key concepts that he

00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:19,909
talked about well in that data set the

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:22,659
key concepts identified were the

00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:26,149
following top four board of directors

00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:29,750
Richard Sherman chairman and then

00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:30,470
finally API right that if you remember

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,940
the

00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,520
lines I don't specs remember them so

00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,250
I'll tell you they a lot of them were

00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,300
actually talking about something

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,619
tangentially related to programming

00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,629
these thirty eight point eight percent

00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,669
of them were talking about it but what

00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:47,139
were they talking about visa vie

00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:50,599
programming the business of programming

00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:53,450
lawsuits about Java and boards of

00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,790
directors people leaving companies

00:34:53,450 --> 00:35:00,770
different kind of things like that

00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:04,150
so in that overall context the sentiment

00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:07,400
of the headlines were not positive a

00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:09,980
lawsuit typically is not a positive

00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,470
sentiment for lawyers it's a very

00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:16,790
positive sentiment for most of us it's

00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:19,640
not positive but yet the emotional

00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,920
analysis of the text of those headlines

00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,290
so not the sentiment the sentiment with

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,040
lawsuits and board of directors accident

00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:30,560
but the emotional contour the shape of

00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,890
the emotionality of those words were

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,070
kind of in between two extremes joy and

00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:39,770
anger when something is in between kind

00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:42,230
of roughly in between two extremes what

00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:46,580
might you say it actually is trying to

00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:48,920
do I see somebody thinking about saying

00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:51,970
it but not saying it what is actually

00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,970
trying to do is trying to articulate

00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:58,070
neutrality trying to articulate

00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:00,470
neutrality what is neutrality except

00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,630
making everyone angry believe that's

00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:04,310
essentially what it's trying to do so if

00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:07,520
you look at those news headlines you try

00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:11,210
and see a journalistic attempt at

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:14,930
balancing a overall negative sentiment

00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:16,460
of topics with trying to be neutral in

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:19,430
the emotionality of how they're

00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,859
expressing them so that's the difference

00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:24,859
between emotional scoring and sentiment

00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:26,210
scoring so where does this leave us well

00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:29,150
I think it leaves us we have to take a

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,800
full circle back to Alan Turing and ask

00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:33,260
ourselves now that we have a little bit

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,790
of an introduction to NLP its national

00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,160
language processing sentient analysis

00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:38,810
are we at a place where we can say that

00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,839
machines are thinking in the terms of

00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:43,279
human thought and human language I'll

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,919
leave that for you

00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:48,289
maybe if they yes maybe I said no Yulia

00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:50,029
thinks it's probably a no I leave that

00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:52,789
for all of you to articulate and to

00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:55,069
grapple with I want to thank you so much

00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:57,859
for this time you've all been so

00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:59,509
suddenly hospitable it is amazing

00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:01,159
walking down the street I keep on

00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:04,519
checking for my wallet is it still there

00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:06,469
you're all so friendly and last but not

00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:08,779
least I just leave you this resources

00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:10,279
page here which some interesting things

00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:12,140
if you're interested in studying more

00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:13,519
about this a book called through the

00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,589
language glass why the world looks

00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,719
different other languages buy guide

00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:18,919
deutscher and then this article seminal

00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:21,769
article of the University of Chicago

00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:23,839
Press on polarity so understanding the

00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:26,359
deep inner workings of how polarity is

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,549
understood and then the API references

00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:30,049
for the three API is and finally the

00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:30,999
repo for this little application if

00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:33,260
interesting playing with it yourself

00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:39,939
thank you very much
