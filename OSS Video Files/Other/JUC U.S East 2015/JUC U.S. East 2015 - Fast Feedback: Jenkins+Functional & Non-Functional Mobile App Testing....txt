Title: JUC U.S. East 2015 - Fast Feedback: Jenkins+Functional & Non-Functional Mobile App Testing...
Publication date: 2020-01-23
Playlist: JUC U.S East 2015
Description: 
	By: Carlo Cadet and Uzi Eilon, Perfecto Mobile

Why is it that more teams talk about extending build automation to include functional and non-functional testing than actually can do it? Is the challenge in implementing automated tests that don’t require babysitting? Perhaps it is reliably executing parallel execution on real devices? Or is the real point of failure a lab that triggers a 40% false negative rate? Are there other obstacles?

This session will explore these issues and offer attendees lessons learned from multiple successful projects that are driving fast feedback through implementing a robust CI practice using Jenkins.

The speakers will highlight:

- Two preconditions for success:
a. A test ready lab offering the ability to mic end user environments
b. Automation that executes continuously and in parallel across multiple targets

- Requirements for strong test planning: 
a. Designing a progressive test plan account for daily, nightly and weekly feedback windows, along with determining appropriate device coverage
b. Inserting non-functional tests for early identification of performance challenges

Presentation examples will feature Eclipse, Selenium Remote WebDriver, TestNG and Perfecto’s cloud-based lab.

this challenge of extending your current

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:24,120
CI practice to mobile

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,250
so what we've tried to do is Uzi and I

00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,640
have the opportunity to work with a

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,740
number of organizations perfecto mobile

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,770
and I'll talk a minute about it and it

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,680
shortly has the opportunity to work with

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,900
many large enterprises and so as we work

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,840
with large enterprises and we're focused

00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,390
in the mobile space we frequently hear a

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,370
few things which is for our mobile

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:53,460
application quality program we'd like to

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:55,800
bridge it into our CI practice and many

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,720
people are trying and what we've

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,040
observed as many people are complaining

00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,450
or struggling in that process and so

00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,630
that's what this presentation is going

00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,420
to focus on in terms of the observations

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,160
or the challenges that we hear as well

00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,200
as the solutions and best practices to

00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,500
overcome some of those but before I

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,680
start let me get a sense of the audience

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:23,070
how many of you are are today doing

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,470
mobile programs great so that's about

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,350
half of you for half of you that raised

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,420
your hands from automation perspective

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,899
who has over thirty percent automation

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,270
as for tech from a test perspective ok

00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:41,789
so I'm seeing I'm sensing challenge

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:44,970
number one ok for those others for the

00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:48,080
are you using real devices yet as part

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:52,349
of your continuous integration process

00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,349
ok so this level sets the audience right

00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:58,380
away so the majority view and let me

00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:00,539
know here are looking to learn because

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,580
you it's on your road map to introduce

00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:04,590
real devices into your CI practice is

00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,069
that your number one objective if you

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,899
could just show of hands all right great

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,160
great so I think this is going to be a

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:16,860
good presentation as you plan out your

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,440
process you're gonna hear a few tips

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,280
that I think are gonna be quite valuable

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:26,030
to you let me first start off with this

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,030
notion of time

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:34,590
if the intention or one of the primary

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,590
benefits of continuous integration is

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,969
quick feedback to the developers I take

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,069
a look at it from a time budget

00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:46,400
perspective what should I do when how do

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:49,920
I manage the time differences between

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,109
for example build processes that are

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,819
triggered on commit or on the polling

00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:56,969
basis that could happen several times a

00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:00,000
day which what happens overnight and

00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:02,879
what could happen from a a weekly test

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,400
perspective and from our perspective is

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,889
that you want to maximize the amount of

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,180
feedback actionable feedback in terms of

00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:13,439
defects introduced X observe or

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,419
potentially performance degradation and

00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,209
bring that fast into the organization

00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,450
back to the dev team and as we take a

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,519
look at it we start of course with

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,469
acknowledging the importance of doing

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,590
the basics which is unit testing and

00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:30,510
getting that unit test coverage as fast

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,940
as possible but then it goes into

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,930
understanding wealthy with a larger time

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:40,530
budget what part of my test suite can I

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,449
introduce into the into the both nightly

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,299
and weekly process so I want to keep

00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:50,220
that notion of time present throughout

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:51,560
the conversation so as an overview we're

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,449
going to talk about some of the

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,319
challenges with regards to bringing

00:03:54,449 --> 00:04:00,780
testing mobile testing into the sea I

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,109
practice we're going to talk about a

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,819
working pattern that we've seen as for

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,979
organizations who perhaps there might be

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:11,009
a couple steps beyond where you are

00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,810
today they're still perfecting it but

00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,370
you know I think there's some definite

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,680
examples learned and I we have some

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,419
examples on that and then hopefully

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,190
you're gonna walk away with some best

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:24,570
practices that you could bring home and

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,159
try to smooth out your journey how many

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:31,860
of you are familiar with perfecto mobile

00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:35,270
a few all right and for the guys in the

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,950
cloud bees in the back thank you so the

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,200
perfecto mobile just a word you know we

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:43,860
really our focus is enabling Oregon

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,350
sations to perform test automation and

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,570
monitoring as well as providing a hosted

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,610
cloud facility of real devices and the

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,370
big emphasis is really on real devices

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,190
and I say that from the perspective of

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,320
from a logic chest logic perspective

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,260
emulators are great but our focus is

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,760
really from a mobile perspective and the

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,650
good news for us is we've been around

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,900
for 10 years we actually have an

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,540
established track record of working with

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:13,320
organizations increasingly folks on

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,940
agile processes let me start off with

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,230
hopefully something that's familiar to

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,240
everybody i think it was back in 2006 in

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,860
that neighborhood or maybe a little

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,560
earlier Mike cone really started

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,710
popularizing the test automation pyramid

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,260
and I think there's from it has a lot of

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,780
Merit in terms of the conversation but

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,480
what we have observed is that when you

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,150
start taking this idea which was really

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,620
built around from a web perspective when

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,950
you bring it into mobile there are some

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:50,880
differences and this actually begins to

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:55,580
change the conversation hi everyone can

00:05:50,880 --> 00:06:00,030
you hear me ok so before I drill down to

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,110
technical ideas and technical suggestion

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,230
I just want to tell you a little bit

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,210
about my day to day every day I have 90

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,370
minutes come here to work and during the

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,850
work i'm having the friend and i'm doing

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:14,630
the following some using checkbooks

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:16,890
facebook's of course i get a lot of

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:20,880
notification about the author i reject

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:25,080
it i watch my youtube video clears our

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,810
emails return to facebook answer a phone

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,500
remember it's at phone and this is what

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,450
i'm doing on my Nexus device and we have

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,570
Carlo he's doing the same but he is an

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:39,030
iPhone guy so suddenly if you're

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,160
thinking about your application your

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:46,230
application needs to handle off the all

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,880
this situation on different devices with

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,230
a different network think about it I

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,630
mean the strength of the network is

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,400
actually changing so now when you are

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,480
thinking about mobile we're not just

00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,210
thinking about

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,640
testing my mobile in clear environment

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,100
but we are thinking about more more

00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:07,770
devices different network virtualization

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:12,620
other event like for cole SMS satellites

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:15,420
later so suddenly this very good methods

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,660
automation methodology is not works

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,990
anymore for mobile and why because

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,670
suddenly we need to add more devices I

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:29,760
need two runs on my test on 10 devices

00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:34,680
20 devices ok and then suddenly I have

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:37,620
the environment parameter for example 3g

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,300
4g rotate the device the very simple

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,340
action but affect most of the

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,140
application by the way I'm talking about

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,830
application and responsive web design

00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:50,550
both are very important to test on all

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,980
the devices and on top of that we have a

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:56,640
performance issue and we have a security

00:07:52,980 --> 00:08:00,980
test that we need to run so suddenly our

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:04,950
tests that we used to run during our CI

00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:09,170
which was mostly unit tests are not good

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:12,840
enough for web for web and mobile and

00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:17,430
how we are going to solve this how can

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:21,870
we execute you either on will divide on

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:24,450
as part of our CI process so let's talk

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,060
about what are the challenges and then

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:29,370
try to understand how to solve it so the

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,550
first thing is we have and we are

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,400
reviewing our customers and our partner

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:38,640
are struggling to add real devices and

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,610
why first of all if you have one tedder

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,099
device that you add to your laptop and

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:47,850
you run some automated tests on it you

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:50,430
cannot build a full C I on top of this

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,780
because it's not stable where you are

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,360
going home the device will not be

00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,250
connected so the devices are not there

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,740
are not available and the device

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,630
readiness think about it you have a lot

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,460
of event as part of the device you need

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,400
to connect it to the y 5 maybe you need

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,490
to connect it to a different action it's

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,399
not easy to have the device

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:14,120
ready and available ready and available

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,420
so what are the solutions first of all

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,899
you must never love love means devices

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,300
or emulator available for you all the

00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:26,180
time and the idea of the most important

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,850
that's when we are talking about the lab

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,310
is the SLA why because if you are

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,459
running tense build a day you must

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,649
devices to be available for you and if

00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:39,170
you have two devices and one of the

00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:41,690
manual tester use one of the device and

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,089
you cannot run the building on top of

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,580
this it's a problem you don't have a VCR

00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:52,570
so in order to have real CI you need to

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:54,890
have a lab and you need to have SLE and

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:59,000
while I love is so important as i

00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:01,070
mentioned SLA i also want to introduce

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,160
the parallel execution when you have lab

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,440
we have a large number of devices you

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,440
can execute the test on all of devices

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,930
on the same time and of course different

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,540
devices let's talk about the different

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,790
devices so this is how it works use the

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,250
factor and what we are doing imperfecto

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,649
your support standard remote web drive

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,260
so what we have in perfecto mobile we

00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:27,380
actually support capability the standard

00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,420
capability of opium or selenium what we

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,910
are reading here is which device do i

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,800
want i would like to execute my test on

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,290
android with version five dot something

00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,300
i would like to execute my script on iOS

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,970
which located in canada and what

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,160
happened right now this property this

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,550
capability will send to perfecto mobile

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,890
cloud with the test itself and we the

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,560
cloud itself will provide you the

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,649
required device so right now the devices

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:59,120
with the specific property will be

00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:02,060
available for you another thing that I'm

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,430
hearing a lot and this is based on what

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,579
we had in the past in the past most of

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:10,399
our test was manual maybe you have T

00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:12,860
very easy to implement right now when we

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,890
are talking about development it's hard

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,070
it's a new language it's a new skill

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,080
sets that need to be developed it's also

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,300
the

00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,650
internet is not easy this is what we are

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,930
hearing from our customer and our

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,060
suggests so justin is the following

00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,790
first of all and the most important

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,710
thing is the easy object identification

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,780
it's means that most of the automation

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:41,710
at the end will be based on the way that

00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:45,280
you identify the object right so how do

00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:47,110
you have easy object identification by

00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,930
having collaboration between the

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,960
developer and the tester and you are us

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:55,780
the build manager need to have them to

00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,940
build this communication they can create

00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,660
an object with ID which makes the

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,720
automation very easy which make it Mary

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:09,340
very robust which makes all the bills to

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:12,610
pass and you don't going to have a false

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,990
false negatives which is our worst enemy

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,600
if we are talking about the build

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:20,230
environment another very important thing

00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,930
is develop a framework find a team with

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,020
a strong development capability and ask

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,450
them to develop the framework and

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,850
separate the framework from the test

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,310
itself I saw a lot of example like this

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,340
I would like to share one of you so this

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,530
is an example for an infrastructure so

00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:43,540
first of all you can use the BDD which

00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:45,600
is define your test in an English I'm in

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:49,870
the login script enter my credentials

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,590
click on login button and then so this

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,480
is done by the product owner and then we

00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,820
have this type and this is something

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,660
really important this is just a JSON

00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:05,860
which identified all the object in the

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,750
stream so I have the ID I have my name

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,800
my last name and my email these are the

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:14,010
three fields that I have in my form okay

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,830
and another important thing here that

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,720
the type used is ID why because I have a

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,690
good relationship between the tester and

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,830
the developer so each object contains an

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:31,170
NID and at the end this code generated

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:33,390
automatically so the tester will write

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,550
this definition

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,590
the infrastructure or the framework will

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,890
generate the code so in this case you

00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,690
will be able to create a lot of tests

00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,880
easily and now there are a different

00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:48,050
time implementation or so implementation

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,700
is in XML and I saw implementation on

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:53,220
Excel the test to write the test in

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,560
Excel automated script generated and

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,570
create and selenium screen so this is a

00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,160
good practice why because it's helped

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,270
you to have one strong team of

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:05,160
developers that actually maintain the

00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,740
framework and the tester can create a

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:11,400
lot of tests and increase it and manage

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,650
it and maintain this so what does it

00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:17,190
mean that build good expert and you can

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:19,500
see here an express as example so this

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,330
is starboard starboard starbucks

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,540
application and you can see the

00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,160
developers the apple developer and the

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,410
galaxy developer or the android

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,710
developer are not working together and

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,330
it looks even it's looks different so

00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,220
let's think about the first log in

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,100
action the first login actions that i

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,770
need to implement is actually find the

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,350
object username or find out of the

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:47,330
username and email and enter the email

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:49,710
right so now if i need to run one test I

00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:54,900
mean a problem because I need to have

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:58,440
two different identification so try to

00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:00,690
use and smart expert in this test or in

00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,150
this case I use the content and I said

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,040
find the element find the text field

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,230
which contains the username and then it

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,060
works on both of the application so it

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:12,270
helped me to create the right expert

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,540
it's very clear it's very robust and

00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:18,180
more important it's actually

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:22,110
cross-platform execution this code this

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:25,350
line will enter the value my email into

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,450
both of the devices iphone and android

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,660
so i have one code that worked on both

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,940
of the platform yes but the most

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,220
important thing here when you create

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,850
automation you don't have an ID try to

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,060
find the smart ways to identify and to

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:45,930
have the expat and try to have one code

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:50,019
that works on both of the devices

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:52,329
this is a classic I arrived to customer

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:55,060
most of our customer so we arrived into

00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:57,069
a customer's that running yes that

00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,779
that's a good good point Joe there are

00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:01,180
two options one your Chinese I repeat

00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:03,550
the question you see so if you have a

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,860
page of Jack methodology and then you

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,870
have two different paths based on what

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,029
you learn what should be the next page

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,410
you know how to manage the next page so

00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:13,499
there are two options one option is

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,350
actually to think about translate a

00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:18,910
transactions so the page object will be

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,579
transaction-related so you're going to

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,279
have the path and all the data will be

00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:26,230
all the tests will be in one class per

00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:30,519
transaction this is one options the

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:35,139
other options is to have the next page

00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:37,809
as part of the parameter which arrived

00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:40,870
so you are running the test and based on

00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:42,430
the based on the buttons that be

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,800
impressed or based on the data that

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,689
enter in this specific page you are

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,629
invoked the next page and it can be

00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:51,579
different page so in the page object

00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:54,550
when you have the path when you have the

00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:57,639
conditions just implement both of the

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,290
way and if you don't have the notion at

00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,029
the beginning of the test what you need

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:06,069
to do you need to have added generic

00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:08,980
data that get all the page using the get

00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:12,120
all elements use and getting the error

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:15,159
and run on the iron dust will be totally

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,539
dynamic code but it's need to be smarter

00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:20,380
because you need to understand or to

00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:23,110
analyze the the past based on the object

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:27,490
that you got from the gate elements

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:29,039
command so I'm returning into here so we

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,720
are arriving to customers at using

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,340
selenium runs it on web and now they

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,460
want to expand it to mobile and then

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,110
they said told me that I have two

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,399
thousand three thousand ten thousand

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,620
scripts and i have twenty-five percent

00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:45,220
of error and if you have twenty-five

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,690
percent of error from 440,000 script you

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,299
are not getting any benefit from

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,860
automation why it's take a lot of time

00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:56,140
to analyze the street better to have 100

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,910
test cases that you know that worked and

00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,920
fought for

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:05,340
test cases with twenty five percent of

00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:08,440
error so why and our two or three main

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,900
topic first of all I'll start with the

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,060
environment readiness sometimes the

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,220
environment is not really ready remember

00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,140
when we are running the test on a real

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,450
devices when we are running the tests on

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,420
the mobile it actually runs end to end

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:25,180
it not just a unit test that we control

00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,660
all the parameters it's actually related

00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:30,850
to the other component and it's Rick

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,820
dependent on the database and on the

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:37,630
api's so the most important thing is to

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:41,440
have a readiness of free in the before

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:43,780
test trial run a readiness function we

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,270
check that everything will just try to

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:49,270
do something very smooth if it will not

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,700
work do not continue with your test

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,230
that's one thing another thing is based

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,600
on the test itself if we are talking

00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,250
about mobile there is a lot of issue is

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,830
the device are then you have a pop-up

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:02,710
that the network is not available

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,020
suddenly you have a call SMS some some

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:08,740
kind of this so you need to implement an

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,180
error handling mechanism the best

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,100
practice in perfecto mobile is the

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,380
following when you have an error try to

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,930
get another device executed again and if

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,630
you have the same error just then

00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:21,220
notified Jeff Justin bill break the

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:26,530
build don't break the Builder to

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:29,140
matically and this is an example for on

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,150
error in perfecto mobile so I mentioned

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,650
we are talking with this is a java code

00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,420
but we can't work with any other

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,120
language and what i have here i have

00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:40,750
three layers first of all I'm looking

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,690
for the UH narrow I'm looking for

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,090
message box with a button with ok why I

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:49,060
have a lot of pop up with ok or cancel

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:51,880
so this is called the system level

00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:55,120
control I can get the button or the

00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,130
message from the device itself its

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,860
external to my application I press the

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:02,260
ok button and then I i if it does not

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,180
work i'm going to close and open my

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,390
application and restart met the test and

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:10,060
then i have if everything does not work

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:12,700
i can restart the device or get the next

00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,100
available device okay remember when we

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,400
are working with browser when we are

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:23,500
working with real devices we need to

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:27,580
have an extra an extra tests with an

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:30,280
extra functions before we are sending an

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,050
arrow to our build machine why because

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,290
it can be the environment it can be the

00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:42,130
device check it test it and then just

00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:47,040
notify their question so we talked about

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:52,780
the devices the development the

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:54,250
execution and now that the the error

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,710
handling and now let's talk little bit

00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:01,660
about the execution it's like a lot of

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:05,550
that real devices club how to improve it

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:08,020
so yes it always will be slower than

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:11,700
local browser on your machine that's

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:14,740
true but if you will be able to use and

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,600
parallel execution and said okay I would

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,430
like to execute my script on 10 devices

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,880
and it's going two runs on the 10

00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:24,610
devices you are solve the problem for

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:28,990
example I hadn't customers that executes

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:30,970
25 tests in 40 minutes and you need to

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,370
reduce it so what we did we just added

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:36,670
more devices to the cloud and now each

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:40,030
test of the test actually split between

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:43,600
the devices and we actually runs in a

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:46,330
slower within a shorter windows another

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,930
thing is the best practice for example

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:52,090
don't use a wait wait is the best it is

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,340
a bad practice use a synchronizer

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:57,310
element wait for something to be open

00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,690
identify the object of know what are the

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,000
objects that you are looking for and

00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,250
wait for the object and then it's help

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,980
you to create a better flow a better

00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:10,000
script and best practice we imperfect on

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,580
mobile we have something called

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,470
community dock perfecto mobile com we

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:18,240
have a lot of code samples I said this

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:21,130
is better than this one use xbox with

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,990
use this user ID and not expose if you

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,260
can't use an xbox with content and not

00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,870
where

00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:29,110
divx but all these data is actually all

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:31,390
these tips will help you to create a

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,370
better script you have the option to

00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:36,130
improve your script it's like a database

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:39,880
that you can improve your SQL the same

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:43,510
way good practice good code will create

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,510
a good SQL so what I want to show you

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,520
here is two options first of all manage

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,100
the timer change the timer is part of

00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,080
the script the two first line you can

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,370
change the timer during the script if

00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,020
you know that you have something that

00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,450
you need to wait only five seconds

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,850
change it to five seconds and then after

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,160
that return it to 30 seconds everything

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,170
based on you need another thing that I

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,950
think is very very important is actually

00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:11,140
the the parallel execution what I did

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,510
here i actually used test Angie I

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,010
believe most of you using testing g so i

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,280
decided to use the parallel execution

00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:22,540
and i'm providing the device property as

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,700
a property or as a parameter to my test

00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:27,160
so now my test is going to get four

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:30,160
devices and going two runs on four

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,200
devices by the way we on top of this we

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,600
have another layers i said ok you want

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,430
to execute your test on four devices one

00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,730
iphone one android one tablet and one

00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:41,830
chrome which is a pc laptop and in the

00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,290
end if in the cloud let's say you have

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,690
three tests if in your cloud you have

00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,670
three iphones the three tests will run

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,890
on each test will run on different

00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:53,620
iphone and you'll get all the report

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,840
into one centralized mechanism so we

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,730
have they execute all the tests on a

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,550
different device on the same time and if

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:04,300
it's the same device property it just

00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:09,850
going to help and execute part of the

00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:12,660
tests any questions about the techniques

00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,660
and above the cloud

00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:21,420
okay for more details if you want to be

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:25,770
to see more for example we are actually

00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:28,980
in booth number 23 it's you can in front

00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:32,340
of this door also Uzi is also doing a

00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,990
lightning talk at twelve o'clock where

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,540
he'll is going to go over a few specific

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,040
examples in terms of best practices that

00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,260
are posted right now in our community

00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,150
what I want to do is come back in terms

00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,970
of this conversation about time and

00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,950
managing the time budget from a feedback

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,870
loop perspective and one of the things

00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,940
that that we've worked with customers

00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:54,120
out is how to plan out that schedule and

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,460
have a a test strategy that dovetails

00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,310
into the CI cycle and specifically

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,140
trying to understand one of the best

00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:03,450
practice we observe Uzi kind of touched

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,460
on is understanding the test suite but

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,460
not monolithically on breaking apart

00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,530
that test suite into a variety of test

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,870
groups were you able to identify what

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,550
your priority transactions are what are

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,900
you going to do for example in every

00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,480
build what are you going to do

00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,040
periodically in terms of the cycles for

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,500
example from a weekly or a nightly

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,810
perspective another aspect of that is

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,720
from a performance perspective we are

00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:30,210
very strong proponents of trying to

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,850
introduce performance testing earlier on

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,200
in the process from a feedback and by

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:37,350
performance testing I want to make sure

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,000
we separate the idea of load versus all

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,460
the rest of the aspects that you could

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,410
learn from performance testing for

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,900
example one of the things that you're

00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:48,200
able to do early on is simply embedding

00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,520
the notion of timers or for example

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,620
specifically looking for for breakage

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,020
due to timeout failures by actually

00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,790
extending some of the transactions but

00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,460
really trying to understand your test

00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:01,590
strategy and being able to optimize it

00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,090
from a durations perspective I was

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,490
speaking to another group last week

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,310
where they were talking about on average

00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:11,280
the target for their organization was to

00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:12,770
strive to automate automated test

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:17,220
iterations that are about one to two

00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:21,770
minutes per test case but then as taking

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:24,300
a look at managing all the outliers and

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,970
aggressively trying to bring that those

00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,389
outliers down to that one to two minute

00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,190
range

00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:32,999
so therefore they can maximize the

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:35,159
executions are able to include one of

00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:37,320
the things that and I think Uzi touched

00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,959
on almost all of these aspects in the

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,700
conversation is really making sure that

00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:44,219
there's a clear test plan for it to

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,289
support the CI perspective and we look

00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:48,299
at it as a cookbook in terms of the

00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:51,959
elements that need to be in place for

00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:54,059
the process you know Uzi mentioned for

00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:56,419
example the page object model is one of

00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:59,099
the design patterns that we see as

00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:01,799
particularly effective for organizations

00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,989
in terms of being able to maximize the

00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,909
amount of reuse that's occurring and

00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,649
therefore being closer and closer to

00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:10,169
getting automation built into sprint

00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:12,659
zero and therefore getting that feedback

00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:14,700
loop going it also has to do with

00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:17,009
changing the mindset changing the

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,109
mindset in organizations where for some

00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:21,119
organizations manual is simply the

00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:23,399
default approach to thinking but

00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,950
obviously the bridge to a CI pattern is

00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:27,869
obviously going to require moving to

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:31,159
manual testing as the exception and

00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:33,779
automated testing as the norm in

00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:35,639
addition is the idea that we started

00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:37,639
back if you kind of remember Uzis slide

00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:40,999
earlier with regards to the commute is

00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:43,409
being able to think not only in terms of

00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:45,989
executing the functional test of the of

00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:48,239
the transaction but understanding the

00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:50,729
transaction in the context that users

00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:53,009
are actually experiencing and being able

00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:55,379
to factor in user conditions into the

00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:56,789
conversation what happens for example to

00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:58,469
a transaction when the battery is

00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:01,709
running low what happens to the

00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:05,070
transaction when the the network is move

00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:08,659
from LTE to 1g for example how does that

00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:11,700
impact the transaction and being able to

00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:13,529
include that and one of the things that

00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,450
we touched on earlier in the

00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:17,700
conversation was we touched a one

00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,769
example of the dev QA collaboration

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,379
around object identification but it

00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:24,690
really starts very early in the process

00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:26,609
in Sherman understanding that breaking

00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:32,249
down that wall that has frequently

00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:33,839
separated QA and Dev and so one trying

00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:37,739
to move to a close before a couple of

00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:41,130
examples is the notion of being able to

00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:43,500
share the tools between dev and QA

00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:46,680
being able to start from the same IDE

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,650
that the dev team is using the QA should

00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,720
be using for example if it's a if it's a

00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,580
Java Eclipse environment then Java

00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,060
selenium makes a great starting point

00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:01,280
from a QA perspective in addition in

00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:03,780
addition being able to over time

00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,180
developing that coding breast practices

00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:09,090
coding best practices for example in

00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,070
terms of being able to always have a

00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,920
strict kind of definition in terms of

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:16,050
object naming conventions as well as

00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,060
being able to understand that XPath to

00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:20,010
hand it over what I have there is a

00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,230
number three is that pom maintenance or

00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:25,470
page object model maintenance or with

00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:27,570
regards to whatever the test framework

00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,490
that you've built out being able to

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,860
manage that as well from a staffing

00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,870
perspective we've seen be we've seen

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,400
that the shift that's occurring as as

00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,710
the QA team becomes increasingly

00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,330
technical teams becoming able to

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,400
specialize who's actually building

00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,730
scripts who's actually maintaining and

00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,850
building out that framework Uzi provided

00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,920
several great examples with regards to

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,500
essentially dynamically managing errors

00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,960
or notifications during the test and

00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:58,340
being able to reduce the breakage that

00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,050
occurs during automation of that test

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,060
one of the things that we didn't talk on

00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:05,310
and it's an example that I'll draw on a

00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:08,090
moment from one of our customers is as

00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:11,010
part of the the build itself before

00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:12,960
launching the main suite of tests

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,600
actually being able to do a readiness

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,550
check under confirm whether the all the

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,320
web services are there confirmed for

00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,780
example that the device is actually

00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,120
ready in or in terms of being able to do

00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:27,150
or roll over to a second device as an

00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,390
example and of course Susie talked about

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:34,350
parallel execution one of the

00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:37,080
conversations that that I always include

00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:39,420
to underscore in this is the notion of

00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,770
that culture matters a lot of the the

00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,840
change that we've been talking about

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,570
obviously for a conference like this

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,790
with the conversation with regards to

00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,860
agile and being able to move to a CI

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:53,970
pattern is also changing the way people

00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,669
think and so I always include that this

00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,859
is a ploy

00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:58,629
to make sure that we not only have the

00:30:56,859 --> 00:31:01,480
tools conversation of the techniques

00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:05,259
conversation but to keep that the people

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,299
in mind from a point of view of trying

00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:10,419
to wrap this up before I provide to

00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:12,940
specific customer case studies to draw

00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:16,389
the conversation to a close is really

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,859
trying to understand how do how does

00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:20,649
this test automation that we've been

00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:23,590
talking about and real devices fall into

00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:26,529
the sea I pattern itself and so what

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:29,200
you're seeing here in this in this this

00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:31,929
depiction is being able to for most

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,700
organizations the common flow but from

00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:35,980
from dev through their source control

00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:39,009
their build process either managed by

00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,619
Jenkins or other tool that have been

00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:44,169
launching the perfecto test automation

00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:48,450
as one of the jobs in the build process

00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:51,970
and with that being able to execute a

00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:54,669
unreal devices beyond in parallel to

00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:57,309
optimize around the time and then

00:31:54,669 --> 00:32:00,249
finally to get the reporting the

00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:02,289
reporting to get to actionable defect

00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:04,029
remediation one of the things that we

00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:07,049
particularly stress is being able to

00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:09,730
understand is to lower the number of

00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:11,859
defects that declared non reproducible

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,350
by dev and making sure that there's a

00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:16,690
clear step-by-step in terms of where the

00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,909
failure occurred video to understand

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:21,340
exactly where in the application it

00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:23,499
occurred as well as including both

00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,049
application level as well as device

00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:27,700
level vitals in the report to make sure

00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:30,669
that the dev has the opportunity to

00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:34,509
attack aggressively attack that defect

00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:36,609
that's been reported this is an example

00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:40,330
of one of our customers who's actually

00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:42,730
doing see I on a nightly basis today and

00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,889
they're actually transitioning to being

00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,859
able to do it multiple multiple times

00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:50,080
during the day this is an organization

00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:52,179
that you see that there's not a lot of

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,700
activity from a unit test because

00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:57,509
they're relying on third-party dev but

00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:00,399
one of the things that I think is uh I

00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:03,220
always highlight as a key best practice

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,919
for what they do is that at the start of

00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,049
their build as they transition into the

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,500
test portion they're actually doing a

00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:10,330
seer

00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,510
of pre readiness checks that I discussed

00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:16,390
earlier and therefore the idea is to

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:17,530
minimize the false positives that are

00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,180
just triggered by the environment

00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:22,020
failures that are triggered by the

00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:26,920
environment and not by a failed

00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:29,170
transaction itself and so in fact that's

00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,120
one of the key been the key aspects that

00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:33,400
they're doing and then secondly what

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,160
they're focusing on right now is being

00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,800
able to reduce this approximately three

00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,570
and a half hour cycle and their goal is

00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,660
to be able to compress this to about a

00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,950
90 minute cycle so that they could run

00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,500
it throughout the day they're their

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,840
first goal for from a daily execution

00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,490
perspective is to be able to run it in

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,070
the morning in the run in the afternoon

00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:59,500
to get kind of inside the day feedback a

00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:01,840
second customer of ours is rabobank in

00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,720
the netherlands and this talks about the

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,880
process that they are going through

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,730
right now in terms of they've built this

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,970
out as their roadmap for their CI

00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,919
practice and being able to use it as an

00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,899
example of where they ultimately want to

00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:19,419
go is that they want they're moving

00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:22,240
towards a continuous delivery objective

00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:25,990
they've defined as for themselves that

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,139
their goal is to have the capacity to do

00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:31,300
10 releases in a day 10 releases in a

00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:35,139
day and that's not what they're

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,850
anticipating actually doing but it's in

00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,730
terms of how they're sizing their team

00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:42,760
and scaling their process to deliver the

00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,169
business agility to deliver the business

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,690
agility that they need for their

00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:49,740
organization and what they've done here

00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:52,899
is actually in terms of being able to

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:55,360
not only build out this pattern but also

00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:57,910
understand from a build perspective of

00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,610
how they're traversing there are three

00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:03,250
different test environments from dev to

00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:06,720
QA and then they have an acceptance

00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,720
environment for their business

00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,710
with that we want to draw this

00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,570
conversation to a close and take any

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,950
questions that you have but what we've

00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,560
what we've tried to do in this

00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:21,930
presentation is walk through sins to the

00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:25,080
specific challenges that we've heard our

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:27,690
customers expressed as they've tried to

00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,970
introduce real devices and test

00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:32,130
automation into their CI practice and

00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:34,590
shared with you a series of best

00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,720
practices and then concluded by saying

00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,550
that we've actually we're working with

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,500
customers we're actually successful at

00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:43,290
this and are actually maturing their

00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:46,230
implementation so take hope it's

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,960
possible but definitely apply the best

00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,420
practices that you've heard us share as

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,190
well as I'm sure others share thank you

00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,190
very much thank you so much

00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:05,920
