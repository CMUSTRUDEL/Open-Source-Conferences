Title: JUC U.S. East 2015 - It's Not Called Continuous Integration (CI) for Nothing
Publication date: 2020-01-23
Playlist: JUC U.S East 2015
Description: 
	Dan Boutin, SOASTA 

This talk will dig deeply into continuous integration (CI) and the key factors that make up the overall CI process. It will cover the relationships and process flows between change management, configuration management and release/build management. Additionally, we will explore how the CI process, when coupled with a solid performance engineering discipline across the product lifecycle, can result in a better user experience for web and mobile applications. We will speak about the entire lifecycle, the "conveyor belt" of the application lifecycle, with concentration on the Big 3 processes that support the overall CI strategy. Included will be a real-world example of how SOASTA uses Jenkins for its conveyor belt and how this process enabled SOASTA to complete over 100 product releases in 2014 and still maintain customer SLA's for its SaaS product offerings.
