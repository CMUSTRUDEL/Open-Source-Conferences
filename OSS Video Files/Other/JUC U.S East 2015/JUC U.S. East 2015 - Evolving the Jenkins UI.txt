Title: JUC U.S. East 2015 - Evolving the Jenkins UI
Publication date: 2020-01-23
Playlist: JUC U.S East 2015
Description: 
	By: Gus Reiber and Tom Fennelly, CloudBees 

Jenkins is the clear #1 continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) tool because it is very effective when it comes to automated testing and deployment of software in complex and diverse environments. Jenkins has achieved this position in spite of the fact that it doesn’t look as “trendy” as some of the other tools available in the CI/CD space.

In this talk, Gus and Tom will detail ongoing efforts to evolve the Jenkins UI. The goal of the initiative is to give Jenkins a more modern look and feel. They’ll talk about the challenges inherent in this effort, as well as some new Jenkins UI building tools and patterns being experimented with at CloudBees.

People interested in the Jenkins UI should attend this talk. Please bring your bag of ideas and get involved with this effort.
