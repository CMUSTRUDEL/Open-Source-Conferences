Title: JUC U.S. East 2015 - Evolving the Jenkins UI
Publication date: 2020-01-23
Playlist: JUC U.S East 2015
Description: 
	By: Gus Reiber and Tom Fennelly, CloudBees 

Jenkins is the clear #1 continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) tool because it is very effective when it comes to automated testing and deployment of software in complex and diverse environments. Jenkins has achieved this position in spite of the fact that it doesn’t look as “trendy” as some of the other tools available in the CI/CD space.

In this talk, Gus and Tom will detail ongoing efforts to evolve the Jenkins UI. The goal of the initiative is to give Jenkins a more modern look and feel. They’ll talk about the challenges inherent in this effort, as well as some new Jenkins UI building tools and patterns being experimented with at CloudBees.

People interested in the Jenkins UI should attend this talk. Please bring your bag of ideas and get involved with this effort.

the very first thing that we're going to

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,540
do is we're going to do a brief history

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,430
of the Jenkins you I that is going to be

00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,680
profoundly informative for all of you to

00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:28,310
kind of set the context for what we're

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,980
up to then a Tom's going to tell you a

00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,199
little bit about what he's been doing in

00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,920
the UI so far and about some of the

00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:38,840
lessons that he's learned and then he's

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,780
going to move on to show you some of the

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,110
improvements that he's made and some new

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,540
facets in themes and style ability for

00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,100
the Jenkins you want and then I'm going

00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,540
to follow that up showing a

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,920
proof-of-concept demo of the GUI so you

00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,400
all have the chance to see what we're

00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,870
thinking about for the next version and

00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,390
if there's anything that I want you guys

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,699
to all take away from this you know

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,590
despite the sort of ridiculousness of a

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,570
PowerPoint presentation and coming to

00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,170
talk to you all in this sort of venue

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,470
that the UI is actually profoundly

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,240
important especially to me also to Tom

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,950
definitely the cloud be as the company

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,609
and my hope is that for some of you all

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:26,210
here as well that it's important I see

00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:29,960
it as really the Gateway entrance point

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,640
to the product so so let me to put this

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,329
in context with that history I was

00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,159
promising okay so like any good time

00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:39,109
line this one starts with the really the

00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,000
beginning of recorded history in a

00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:43,609
40,000 BCE we had our first cave

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,710
paintings and I wasn't long after that

00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:48,320
that a man discovered that there were

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,229
bugs and software so shortly thereafter

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,210
kk invented hudson to help address some

00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,770
of that problems and really the

00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,810
brilliance of hudson although you can

00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,140
see it has a UI which was super duper

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,380
important obviously the real importance

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,149
of it was the community aspect behind it

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:08,270
so what made Hudson different from other

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:10,850
products of it's sort and today was that

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,830
people could contribute so again part of

00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,819
the reason why I'm out here and it Tom's

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,740
out here and we're going to pitch this

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,490
really hard as we're hoping to engage

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,770
you all and your brain muscles in what

00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,100
the Jenkins you I should be like we're

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,210
going to

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,310
you what we hope is a compelling

00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,690
demonstration of what it can be like and

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,550
we're eager to get y'all's feedback

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,500
about what you think what you like what

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,910
you don't like because the Jenkins

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,810
community is above all things and

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,640
inclusive community okay so then in 2011

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,950
we had the Great Schism Hudson and

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,750
Jenkins you can see there was a fairly

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,220
significant you i change the butler

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,750
looks different a little better maybe

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,820
and now we have modern times and this is

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,380
a where Tom and I come in and we're

00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,490
going to start showing you what's going

00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,960
on with these pieces all right so early

00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,200
progress I'm going to hand this over to

00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,200
Tom

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,000
so as I said over last year I've been

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:12,250
doing bit to work on the Jenkins UI and

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,860
the most lead what we're talking about

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,270
the recent past has been kind of

00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,760
refreshing to look and feel a lot of a

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,020
changing so I am just listing some of

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,000
the things we can't book through things

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,420
but what kind of the the highlighter

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,250
guess would have been replacing of the

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,980
table based layouts with div base layout

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,900
so which allowed us basically to do

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,140
responsive make the UI more responsive

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,910
so I different types of devices stuff

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,380
like that the layout kind of adjust

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,690
itself more appropriately for that

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:45,010
device and also did some other things

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,810
including css-based and icons as opposed

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,740
to the old image-based icons no reason

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,900
why I'm listened out here is because

00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,400
relevant to the demo we're going to

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,960
doing a little bit but I suppose

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,390
importantly as well one of the things we

00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,910
tried to do is not disrupt the current

00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,060
set of plugins or make them unusable in

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:04,810
any way so if we did do that were not

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,600
aware of it and that is no am but I

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,209
think the most important thing that and

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,800
we got from the exercise over the last

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,900
year where the things we did that we

00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,550
learned in terms of what what's wrong

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,049
with Jenkins UI and the sort of

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,930
improvement that we need to make to it

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,360
to gently score in order to make a more

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:26,140
profound improvements voi and the user

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,320
experience in Jenkins and so basically

00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,760
what did we learn so did I'm going to

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,520
list basically list a few things here

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,620
that the areas where we think if we make

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,360
improvements in the Jenkins uie we can

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,370
then make major improvements in terms of

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,930
user experience in Jenkins so one of the

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,380
first things we're going to talk about

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,380
is CSS and modernization CSS is a

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,270
problem at the moment so basically there

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,300
is no real marginalization with the CSS

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,750
so we think if we if we can fix that we

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,210
can make some major improvements

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,250
in the Uni to see new pretty cool new

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,640
features this is something going to talk

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,340
about more detail now a few minutes and

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,960
another problem when people are either

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,630
very where it is maybe not might not be

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,860
aware of the cause a gasp or everyone's

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,730
aware of the fact that configuration

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,720
cane pages William Jenkins are pretty

00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,270
painful experience sometimes especially

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,550
if you've got lots of plugins install

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,050
all the stuff like that and the main

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,810
reason for that is is basically how the

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,370
page is laid out in terms of dis

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,350
semantically over the page it's kind of

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,690
hard to infer things about the layout

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,070
and make adjustments good this is some

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,730
that course is going to go into detail

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,800
in his partner to talk and he's got

00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:41,400
really cool demo on that part of that

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,880
and then finally hopefully we get talked

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,230
a bit about how modulation with a of the

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,550
JavaScript code in Jenkins UI is and not

00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,950
exactly what it should be at the moment

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,840
or no real modulation so if you know the

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,550
coral Jenkins you know the most of the

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,160
javascript is in far as like Hudson

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,260
behaving and it's basically like a dog's

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:08,669
dinner of JavaScript there's all sorts

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:10,590
of stuff thrown in there okay so am so

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,970
basically we reckon if we can if we can

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,530
sort out some of these problems in a

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,169
meaningful way would be able to start

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:23,100
doing kind of new approach tested to a

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:25,110
UI development in Jenkins and the terms

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,870
of moderation CSS so that was the first

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,890
thing I hadn't list there and one

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,750
approach that we've been looking out

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,460
recently and have had some success with

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:36,780
is using less or less is basically a CSS

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,060
preprocessor mature people are aware of

00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,590
it or not for them basically what what

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,610
it was one of the things less will allow

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,169
us that it would allow us to do a number

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,850
of things but but the first and probably

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,040
most important part about it is that it

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,440
allows us to actually modular i use the

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,860
CSS or rather than having one big CSS

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,720
but with all the style in there we can

00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:00,750
basically break it out into more logical

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:03,360
and CSS components second thing that CSS

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,280
allows us to do is parameterization to

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,920
CSS so if you look in the CSS and

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,810
changes at the mall

00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,030
there's there are different types things

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,660
like colors and different background

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,120
colors order parameters of that bottle

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,160
weights great border radiuses all sorts

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,470
of impact on politics that are kind of

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,730
all over the place in the CSS what less

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,060
of that would allow us to do is actually

00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,770
kinda centralized those in one place and

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,290
kind of have a more consistent and

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,420
looking feel in terms of the CSS

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,890
properties of the pages so that the

00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,000
variables can be used instead of the

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,460
actual raw colors and then thirdly and

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,590
partly for us i think what less will

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,110
allow us to do is actually namespace to

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,380
CSS so what that means then is we can

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,150
start making use of some really useful

00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:52,330
CSS libraries out there like bootstrap

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:55,600
and jQuery UI and you have used them in

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,890
a safe way such that the CSS rules known

00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,840
conflict with each other and stuff like

00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,300
that so there are some of the benefits

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,860
he is good that those three benefits in

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,050
themselves or well they're very useful

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,300
and Starling concerned I think one of

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,330
the most most important things about

00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,370
moderate the CSS will be the fact that

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,250
it will let us introduce new kind of

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,500
ideas into Jenkins and the main one

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,870
being at the moment that we can see it's

00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,570
the idea of user interface teams and

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,940
speaking CSS modularization will be a

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,830
very important part of that so basically

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,690
what would happen over there with you I

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,170
teams is the idea of place to allow the

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:34,180
user to customize cleanness style and

00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:38,080
behavioral characteristics at you I and

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,540
to do that on a pair of login basis so

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,460
instead of everybody that on the Jenkins

00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,350
instance having the same user interface

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,570
that the base we allow them to actually

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,580
could you choose it because my interface

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,560
in a way that suits them so basically

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,140
like credit stylistic things like change

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,030
the headers and icons and stuff like

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,520
that but also if you have a preference

00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,740
in terms of how we want the mayor that a

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,930
lot of men useful okie can tweak them

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,000
for your login change the status Paul

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,160
stuff like that that you should be able

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,519
to do this kind of thing with with

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,850
you a teens and CSS would be important

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,310
her that but and it's not just kinda eye

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,240
candy stuff that this is important it's

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,100
not just for that reason that is

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,560
important in terms of solvent and

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,379
Sullivan kind of important usability

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,300
issues you I teams tinker can play a

00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:27,699
very important role so like for people

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,829
of color blindness or other visual

00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:31,689
impairments we can date they will be

00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:36,699
able to actually customize the UI to

00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:41,079
suit them ok so the station gonna little

00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:43,750
demo so I actually have a quick question

00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:49,930
for for all y'all out here how many of

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:51,759
you all make plugins so a few okay and

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,800
use plugins are there a lot of you that

00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,810
use plugins pretty much everybody uses

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,949
some set of plugins how about folders

00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,319
that are a good setting you guys get

00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:02,319
these folders when you use folders use

00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:04,569
them extensively awesome that's just for

00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:08,379
my benefit not for years I don't you

00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:15,130
guys just works here that was just for

00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:16,810
me yeah so some while ago actually it's

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,160
a probably two or three months ago at

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,310
this stage I started playing around with

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,170
this idea of using less tu madres the

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,939
CSS and Jenkins and they started

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,610
building some components components

00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:30,459
around that so there's a UI teams pogin

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,990
and under some other components that get

00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:33,430
built into need to get built into

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,170
Jenkins corner this isn't in Jenkins

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,709
cold today but I've got a Jenkins

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:42,759
instance running here with it in it okay

00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:44,079
so I've got to two browsers okay neither

00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,300
from logged in so i'm going to log in to

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,610
different users first one is going to be

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,069
myself as you can see the janky the

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,750
instance here by default looks basically

00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:54,540
looks the same as jenkins at the moment

00:10:52,750 --> 00:11:03,149
even though the teams are running

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:03,149
underneath sorry

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,020
whereas you would

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,899
sorry

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:33,240
let's get this up again okay now we got

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:37,350
it so I've got two logins here I'm from

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,320
myself and then another account here go

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,360
wit goes okay and so as you can see the

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,300
both the same style got the same layout

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,160
so they're not much DC durable what when

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,230
I actually go into the acted the user

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,050
account I have this icon here on the

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,240
left hand side you I teams what it

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,920
allows me to do it brings up the UI team

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,040
configuration for that user so by

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,630
default the user has we have done is

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,780
extracted a number of different types of

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:05,550
teams out of the style that CSS into

00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,760
modules of their own and created actual

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:10,260
teams okay so at the top here you can

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,820
see on the tabs you can see the

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,710
different teams that have got at moma

00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,550
which we could extract a lot more sort

00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:19,350
of page header icons status balls

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,270
console output and then along on the

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,730
left-hand side there in each case what

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,260
we've got is an implementation different

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,760
implementations of each of those teams

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,850
and the idea is that you can contribute

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,490
people can actually create new

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,810
implementations of different teams and

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,580
contributed so that users can actually

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,050
start using them so it BK so Starla

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,870
install a different plugin or whatever

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,850
for a different icon set and you can

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,960
start using those icons okay so for my

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,270
account here what I'll do is change the

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,310
icons to use font are some icons I'm not

00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,710
sure if you're aware desert of fantasy I

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,850
cantar some icons what you can see is on

00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,700
the left is that when i change that

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,170
there are the icons automatic change and

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,960
this is going back to what i was saying

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:03,600
earlier about CSS changing the d icons

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,060
in Jenkins from be using images to CSS

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,650
is something we did earlier so that that

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,330
change has made this pretty looking

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,970
possible so if you actually look at the

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,640
source there are now instead of an image

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:17,700
what you actually get to see is just a

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,190
simple span element that get styled so

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,080
when we change the team did this panel

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,840
don't get styled differently okay so

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,820
they touch the icons there and i'll

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:31,150
change the status ball so you know the

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,770
build status indicators classic

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,140
indicators are the icons that are all

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:38,020
used it at the little bounce in animated

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,300
gifts so if I change those we ated it

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:44,620
and another implementation of the status

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:46,660
balls team which is using CSS animations

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,130
so basically it's not using images at

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,450
all it's just using the browser itself

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:56,440
to animate the animated Dave okay so

00:13:52,450 --> 00:14:00,010
we're going to change my status balls to

00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,110
use css3 animations I will flick over to

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,450
so if I go at it bandpage now you can

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,800
see how the look and feel is a little

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,570
bit different but he as you imagine if

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,890
you did put more working this weekend in

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,030
today's we can do a lot more radical

00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,830
things as well but this is like this is

00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,690
just a small bit of work and we've kind

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,910
of been able to make different changes

00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,910
so for a colorblind person for example

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,900
they could actually changed or their

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,720
status ball to be something different

00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,710
for if blue is the or sorry if green is

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,150
not a color that tattoos or so so so

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,550
it's time saying that I think the value

00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:34,690
here is really sort of well really

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,790
threefold so one is with this sort of

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,500
mechanism you know it's possible to

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,700
package up themes that are pre can see

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,130
you wouldn't have to necessarily take

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,450
the time to configure it all yourself so

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:47,470
that's one big benefit another big

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:49,930
benefit is for those who have very

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,550
specific usability needs the UI itself

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:55,360
doesn't need to sink to that common

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:59,190
denominator and and finally this is

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,540
setting up really the groundwork for

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:04,210
potentially much more significant UI

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,600
changes that then Jenkins has seen so

00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:10,240
far so you know having X pillars and

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,300
plays provides a good foundation to put

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,480
a variety of new rappers on top right

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,100
check so like CSS with just one part of

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,210
you I teams as I see it like I think it

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,250
we can start doing other things as well

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,350
that would allow different types of

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,120
behaviors like with the with the menus

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,980
and stuff that made them collapsible

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,450
make things visible or not visible

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,190
dependent on I mean if you're not

00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,410
interested in having bill q status and

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,970
stuff them in your navigation here that

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,790
you should be able to just check box

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,680
that the manor a kind of thing so just

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,480
continue anyway and on my account here

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,910
I'll change my team to look slightly

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,880
different

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:48,670
and I'll give it use this light team

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,320
here so it's basically just as you can

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,860
see all of the teams here are different

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,080
and options here that you can configure

00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,270
so this goes back to the using less and

00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,950
the parameterization value unless so

00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:04,330
what we've done here is exposed a number

00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:06,190
of parameters in those in those teams

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,350
and made them configurable to the user

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,360
so the user can change the image on the

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,700
top there for example or the background

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,010
color themselves or just pick the little

00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:19,230
light team so I'm gonna just pick that

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:21,220
and then so friend I've got visual

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,410
impairments or green doesn't work for me

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,680
I'm going to change the status balls to

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:34,290
be blue for success just change this

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:37,450
right here in some way apply that and

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,520
then I can change this as well so i'll

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,320
use the the console output i'll change

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,900
that to be a dark so some people like

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,570
Derek as opposed to wait let's change

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,420
that so when I go back here now you can

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:55,930
see my login and so I you refresh the

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:57,190
page looks different and courses okay we

00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,440
can kick off a build her now and I just

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,070
see what happens when with the

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,070
animations

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,839
oops sorry

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,810
okay we can go into the build here for

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,810
example I think this is the wrong

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,510
just the main takeaway is that my mother

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:33,040
is in the CSS and parameterizing and

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,510
stuff like that we can we kind of were

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,420
able to build features on top of that

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:39,310
that make it kind of easier to pull out

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,350
to kind of the behave different

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,880
behaviors and make them easier for users

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:50,680
to configure that's probably the main

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:52,510
take a later alrighty so if I'm sitting

00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,850
down here can you still hear me okay

00:17:52,510 --> 00:18:02,560
through this microphone okay good so I

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:04,270
through this so all right so the work

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,550
that comm showed you as I mentioned the

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,400
important aspect of it is it really sets

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:11,560
the table sets down the framework that

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,400
we can build on to potentially

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:18,400
dramatically affect the polish of the

00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,200
Jenkins you I you know Tom Tom showed

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,090
that we can surface some of these

00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,860
decisions into the GUI itself so that

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,210
you as an end user could tweak it

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,340
without necessarily writing your own

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:31,240
code or plugin or anything but on top of

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,860
that we as cloudbees engineers can equip

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,720
the jacobs experience with something

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,750
that's a little bit more higher polished

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,200
and professional then maybe Jenkins has

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,060
been today so so the beginning here this

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,890
is what the intros for you detectives

00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,410
could look like just a little spit and

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,240
polish not a huge amount to but the idea

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,220
is to make it clear what the very first

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,440
action is the very first action here is

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,000
creating an item normally what you would

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,710
do is use this plus so that's all

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,230
explained here without a lot of

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:04,630
distraction all right so creating an

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:07,390
item okay so if you have a lot of

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,740
plugins and Jenkins you may know that in

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,510
your first section where you choose the

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,940
type of item you want to create it

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,320
doesn't take all that many plugins for

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,900
this to become sort of a toilet paper

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,700
list polluted with every other plug-in

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,590
that you may have installed it has its

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,240
own special item to create so this guy

00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,580
can get to be incredibly long and

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,870
difficult to manage but as part of the

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,420
Jenkins community we want to encourage

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,789
blogging growth and we want people to go

00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,440
and add a new kind of

00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:33,840
that can be created so we don't want to

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,159
have any kind of limit on that so the

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,649
solution is really to come up with some

00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:40,259
sort of categorization for them right so

00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:41,879
if the types of items have some sort of

00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,249
category then you can put them in some

00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:45,690
kind of box and then you can easily scan

00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,639
and find the category that you care

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,590
about without wading through like I said

00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:51,960
a giant toilet paper list of other items

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,129
so to make up for the fact that the

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,869
comments are gone so now i have the

00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:58,950
comments coming back and hover and one

00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:01,109
of the things that we'd like to keep

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,940
getting feedback from you guys is is

00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:05,609
this the right form factor for

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,769
displaying these categories you know

00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:09,570
that's well open from the debate really

00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:11,190
easy to change the names of the category

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,960
is easy to change should they disappear

00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,190
if there's no items in them all these

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,039
kinds of questions are questions that

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,019
come out in discussions with with real

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,940
users like you so what I'm putting

00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,259
together here is just a guess so I'm

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,210
saying I think this is better and

00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:25,979
interesting it shows my point but for

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,649
all these things what I really want is

00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:30,809
will put up places where you can see and

00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:32,519
interact with the UI and I want your

00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:34,019
feedback I want you to tell me now Gus

00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,950
that was really stupid don't do the dumb

00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:41,999
why do it's a good way so yes it looks

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:46,139
create this guy all right module giving

00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:48,059
so let's do it correctly so just for the

00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:50,820
record there are going to need some bugs

00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:53,249
in this this is a actually running on

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:57,809
top of real Jenkins but it's not really

00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:59,970
done code it's just code for the demo so

00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:02,220
I am and in fact I'm going to very

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,529
specifically show you some bugs kind of

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:08,039
on purpose so that you'll know some of

00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:09,929
the areas that were navigating around if

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,729
you are a plug-in creator you probably

00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,409
care very greatly about this

00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,539
configuration form that I'm showing that

00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,799
because your plug-in probably interacts

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,989
with it and you probably had to think

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,460
about how these form controls work and

00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:22,499
which ones you were going to choose and

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,509
Here I am potentially changing them so

00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:26,129
again if you are a plug-in developer we

00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:27,929
definitely want to hear from you we want

00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:30,029
it get your feedback and what kind of

00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:32,159
form controls you wish we're in Jenkins

00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:34,229
and uh we want to have your feedback

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,669
about how you feel your plug-in may or

00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:38,460
may not be affected by some of these

00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,649
potential changes alright so this should

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,080
start to look fairly familiar but with

00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:43,669
the big difference that

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,380
I've taken these guys and I've blocked

00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,690
them in again into clear categories in

00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,909
sections so Jenkins already has the

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:55,700
notion of categories for these items but

00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:58,159
if you look at Jenkins today there's no

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,710
real clear visible divide between the

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,120
sections again this becomes really kind

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:07,309
of a homogenous toilet paper list of

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,080
items in which it's really hard to tell

00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:13,070
which are the important ones and which

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,480
ones are just generic items so here some

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,860
of these will also be generic items

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,809
obviously they have to follow to some

00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,330
degree the same form factor but these

00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:22,190
guys are minimal minimal I zabal so as

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,980
you go through you can put away the

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,299
pieces that you don't want so here we

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,980
are to one of the more important pieces

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:30,200
what kind of source control management

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,630
are you going to use so as you probably

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:36,580
also know in the Jenkins you I these

00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:39,019
components are potentially nestable so

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,549
and sometimes in the current Jenkins you

00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:43,610
I it's a little bit difficult to tell

00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:46,370
what is nested within what it's all

00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:48,980
white they're all kind of again same

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:53,169
heading level so here we have really a

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,730
clear differentiation of the nesting so

00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:58,519
and again this is this is actually the

00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,139
Jenkins configuration page so the same

00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:03,380
metadata that is in Jenkins today is

00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:05,600
what's manufactured this page so the raw

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,919
materials are all there to break out

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,529
that information a little bit more

00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,389
cleanly so get is a little bit more

00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:14,120
popular these days so here's what the

00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:16,370
get guy looks like and already this is a

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,960
significant amount I've been I mean I

00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,970
made it so obviously i love it but it's

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,080
i think a significant of an improvement

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:26,809
over where we are today the hetero list

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,909
control is another important guy and

00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:31,220
it's the control here that's with build

00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,570
steps so one of the things that sort of

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,710
bugs me about this guy is it doesn't

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,720
quite have the prominence that it

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,070
deserves right your build step is

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,039
probably the most important piece of

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,750
your configuration in most cases

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,399
especially in a freestyle bill and this

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,750
guy doesn't have a lot of emphasis so

00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:45,610
one of the easy things I did is just let

00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,170
you know that it's here

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:50,049
even when there's nobody in it so it

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,540
still occupies some visual space but to

00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:55,059
show that these guys are nestable so you

00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,280
can pop in a guy and he's in there he

00:23:55,059 --> 00:24:01,390
still has the same draggable mechanism

00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:03,400
we can add as many steps as we want and

00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:07,240
they're going to continue to nest and be

00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,220
draggable just like you want but again

00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,780
with with some visual differentiation

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,730
not just to make it look nice although

00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,730
that is important to me as a you know

00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:19,390
it's an art school reject but a to make

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:20,620
it actually more more usable all right

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,030
so I'm going to go ahead and save this

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,669
and you're going to get to see one of my

00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:26,679
many bugs okay so one of the hard things

00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:30,040
about this configuration page is the

00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,870
JavaScript that assembles the object the

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,340
JSON object that describes the thing

00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,500
that you submitted it's a little bit of

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,090
technical mumbo jumbo but but this ties

00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,120
back in directly to what tom was saying

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,820
the javascript libraries that are used

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:47,350
now to assemble the Jenkins you I do

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:50,049
some kind of crazy wacky stuff so so I

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:52,510
need basically Tom and people like comic

00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:56,320
help me get in there and straighten

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:58,600
these pieces out to make it so that this

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,940
submit object actually works correctly

00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,640
and you get what you want but regardless

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:06,730
this did in fact create the job so we

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,830
can look at it ok so you made it notice

00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:11,620
that a some things are missing from the

00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:16,690
Jenkins console you I here and there's

00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:17,890
some new coloring buttons instead so so

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,600
this is this is again this is somewhat

00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:22,240
of an ask to you all this is a concept

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,679
that i'm going to put forward that i

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,200
don't know for sure that I have the

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,790
right answer but I think this is a step

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,110
in the right direction and eventually

00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,780
I'm going to looking for feedback from

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:34,660
the community about so I have this

00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:38,559
belief that some of the widgets and

00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,990
Jenkins are better contextual and some

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:44,260
of the widgets in Jenkins are better as

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:46,240
a sort of global system entity so what

00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,059
do I mean by that so if you look at the

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,370
Jenkins dashboard today right first off

00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:54,490
you have this Actions menu

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,710
here and bleeding directly into it these

00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:01,000
are what's called widgets and Jenkins

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:05,230
land down here so in my use of Jenkins

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,600
anyway this build q this widget this is

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,150
important to me regardless of where I am

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,940
in the product you know I want to see

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,620
the bill that's coming next because I

00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,600
may be carrying about an upstream build

00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,520
or a downstream build and when I go

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,170
navigate somewhere I still want to

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,850
follow the build that I was watching

00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:24,490
before I don't want this guy to change

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:26,020
in it but today in the Jenkins you I

00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,850
especially if you're using folders as

00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,800
you navigate into the folders the

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,720
context of what's showing up in the

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,490
queue is dependent on the folder so as

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,100
soon as you navigate into a folder this

00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,860
guy will change if you don't use a lot

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,090
of folders you may not have noticed that

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,620
may be noticed it but you didn't really

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,960
notice why suddenly the thing you were

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,780
watching is gone that's a usability faux

00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,040
pas in mind so so this is what I mean by

00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,820
it something that might be better as a

00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,980
global widget these actions here because

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,570
they are all contextual just as a fact

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,780
of Jenkins's again maybe something you

00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,679
notice maybe something that you haven't

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,929
again depending on how much you use

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,020
folders these actions it needs to be

00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:06,580
clear that they are going to take effect

00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,150
on the particular item that you're

00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:14,140
looking at not in a global context so

00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:15,880
what have I done okay so here first off

00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,380
the create button I'm saying this is a

00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,870
global context from anywhere you should

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,120
be able to hit the create button for the

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:25,210
build q you should be able to see the

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,620
build q wherever you are and you should

00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,880
be able to choose whether you're using

00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,670
that in the context of a particular

00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:34,270
folder but by default you should see the

00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:35,590
build cube every right so that you when

00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,600
you navigate around you don't actually

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,660
lose track of the build that you happen

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,040
to be following right so so that's what

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,510
I'm doing here and I suspect that

00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,800
there's a couple of other elements that

00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,830
would fit this notion of a global

00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,720
context an easy one is just navigating

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:51,429
the Jenkins system settings there's

00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,470
really no reason why you should have to

00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:54,730
navigate away from your build

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,010
configuration or whatever

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,260
looking at to go and change some

00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,669
specific setting within genki you should

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,720
be able to do that immediately so if

00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:04,090
you're looking at this thing and you're

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,630
like oh crap I forgot to add plug in X Y

00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,919
or Z you know it should be a click away

00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,720
you know ideally you wouldn't even lose

00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:11,890
this context on the page change but you

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,080
know we're going to we're going to walk

00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,210
first some other suggestions here might

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,740
be the support bundling widget so

00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,570
probably part of cloudbees jenkins

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,950
enterprises it support bundle so you can

00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,240
check things that you want to send off

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,620
to tell the support people with problems

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,320
you're having that would probably make

00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,120
sense as a global context documentation

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,910
might make sense this guy here this

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,350
guy's meant to be fingerprints I haven't

00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,570
finished all my homework sorry teacher

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,400
some of these pieces don't actually work

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,830
yet but that's that's the idea here

00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:42,730
that's the concept ok so then on the

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:47,650
other side we have the traditional

00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:49,780
Jenkins actions so these guys I've move

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:52,120
them over to the right and I in general

00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:54,040
I view this as a UI faux pas write these

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,169
things used to be on the left and now

00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,530
here's this art student coming along

00:28:56,169 --> 00:29:01,179
suddenly putting them on the right

00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:03,910
normally I would not like to do that I

00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:06,549
know it's shameful but the reason why

00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,380
I'm suggesting it is because I do think

00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:11,080
it's important especially in the case of

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,580
new adoption to have a uniform context

00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,809
for what you're going to put on the Left

00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,460
versus what you're going to put on the

00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:18,400
right so since I've introduced this

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,720
notion of a global context to me global

00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,730
context makes sense to be on the left

00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,350
you come from the broad view of the

00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,720
world move to the narrow view on the

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,970
right so that's my sort of justification

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,370
for actions on the right versus on the

00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,200
left and then also just a matter of

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,240
screen real estate and I want to be able

00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,040
to fit all of these guys on potentially

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,760
at once and I don't want menus

00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,559
clobbering menus so despite the fact

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,780
that I know it's a usability faux pas to

00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:45,900
just up and move critical piece of

00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,370
functionality to the other side of page

00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,929
I'm suggesting with here anyway for

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,720
those reasons so then again this is a

00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:55,120
spot where I'm really hoping you all

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,140
might have some time to experiment with

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,340
the pieces we're going to try to get

00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,500
them out somewhere where they can be

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,360
experimented with and you can tell me oh

00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,190
my god does it's so annoying I keep

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,899
trying to click

00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,909
action button and you when you moved to

00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:09,029
the other side I hate you forever like

00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:10,950
yes that'll make my inner child cry but

00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:14,159
it's important for me to know and I'd

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,330
much rather know it early so that I so I

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,610
can juggle that in with the other

00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,110
factors that were considered I think

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,120
that kind of ties back as well to the UI

00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:23,159
teams like so some of these these

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,629
behavior things if you're not maybe she

00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,679
should be configurable like and it

00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:28,379
should be an option to people when I

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,539
prefer that the other way around my

00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:32,070
global is on the right and locals on the

00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,419
left and it should be just a case that

00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,539
for your login you can switch at the

00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:38,580
other side if you want and that's our

00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:40,830
mutual boss has been using the sort of

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:45,120
catchphrase perspective perspective

00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:48,210
perspective perspectives similar to what

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,950
Eclipse has I don't usually think of

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,799
eclipses like my favorite you I an

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,149
example of good you are but but there is

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,830
something clever about the way you can

00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:57,299
sort of define a workspace I don't think

00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:00,029
that's actually unique to eclipse the

00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:04,019
clips just happens to call them back

00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:05,669
reviews whatever okay alright so so

00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:08,700
that's the gist of these core set of

00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:10,139
changes in addition you may have noticed

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,509
that I haven't really done anything to

00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:14,519
the central table here so that's another

00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:17,700
bit of homework that I'm still chewing

00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:21,600
on is a little bit potentially maybe a

00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:24,330
little bit controversial so in in

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,669
Jenkins today by and large what you're

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,529
navigating our build configurations

00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:30,470
especially if you're using folders build

00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:34,049
configurations and folders and your

00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:36,029
primary axis of view on the world is

00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:37,919
this I'm navigating in and out of these

00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:39,570
folders and I see this list of

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,370
configurations and these sort of

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,710
configuration objects now sometimes

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,179
there are other things in there as well

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:48,000
you know if you're using Jo see there's

00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,320
update centers and masters and some

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,090
other different kinds of elements might

00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,710
also appear in your folders your

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,480
security context is a big thing that

00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:57,029
might be related to your folders but

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,759
your axis of viewing the world is very

00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:01,830
related really to this URL bar it's

00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,710
really not even the folder so much as

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,140
that path that you happen to be looking

00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:10,570
at

00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:12,640
so for jobs i think that works okay but

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,800
there are certainly some limitations you

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,550
might for example want to be looking and

00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,800
sorting your all your build jobs that

00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:24,520
are related to a particular project but

00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:26,740
are failing or maybe you want to look at

00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:31,780
all your build jobs that were last

00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:33,880
touched by you know unreliable Gus who's

00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,830
probably broken something so maybe you

00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,140
want to sort them by last submit and

00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,150
also by project you know you only care

00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,010
about the alpha-beta project than you

00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:43,810
care you know what did gusty last

00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,730
Tuesday because you probably broke it so

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:48,130
it would be nice if you can sort improve

00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,140
items by that criteria rather than

00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,640
climbing in and out of folders or trying

00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:55,150
to have created your folders ahead of

00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:57,910
time to enable the right view or if you

00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,870
had or if you are using views rather

00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,490
than trying to do something sort of

00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,280
programmatic to preset up all these

00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:05,890
conditions it'd be nice if you had

00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,150
basically a basic pivot chart so one of

00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:10,780
the things that we're working on a cloud

00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:12,250
bees is dr. traceability and I I think

00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,190
this is sort of a poster child feature

00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:17,620
for this this kind of mechanism okay so

00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,990
dr. traceability this feature really

00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,870
cares primarily about docker containers

00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:24,570
not about build job configurations so if

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:29,710
you're looking for the container that

00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:33,010
came from the bunt to image it just had

00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,990
a security patch as an example you may

00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,550
and you want to find all of those that

00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,690
came from that same master image they

00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,700
may or may not all be in the same

00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,610
project they may or may not all be in

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,950
the same folder and and even still you

00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:47,290
know where are my docker image is going

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,630
to be shown what that even makes sense

00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:52,030
for them to be in a folder god of not

00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,590
convinced by that so the kind of you

00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,080
that we I would want us to be able to

00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,600
construct is just going to list the

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,580
containers by their name and by their

00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,000
relevant attributes and their attributes

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,380
want to be able to be arbitrary so just

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,940
because something is a particular

00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,950
project doesn't necessarily dictate

00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,679
folders maybe your folders are all based

00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:15,200
on security context but you have QA

00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:17,119
people and engineers and they are

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,460
working on the same project but they

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,379
have very different security context so

00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,879
if you're basing everything on folders

00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:24,829
you have a real problem there because

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,810
it's impossible to be in two separate

00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,619
folders at the same time really the best

00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,750
thing you can do is come up with

00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:31,520
shortcuts so if instead these are

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,500
arbitrary properties of these objects

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,770
that you can sort and group by them so

00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:40,159
as an example here you might say well

00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:41,780
show me the ones that are recent right

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,760
so I've got guys that are long ago I

00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,440
don't care about them this month you can

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,000
see my data set is a little bit stale so

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,240
I really only have guys that are kind of

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,639
old but I can group them close out the

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:57,560
section that I don't want and then sub

00:34:52,639 --> 00:35:01,280
sort them by state right or any of these

00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:06,319
criteria and what that that's really

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,510
letting you do is get a matrix a

00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:10,280
multi-dimensional search effectively or

00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,050
multi-dimensional filter of the items

00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,550
that you care about and if those are not

00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,730
based on folders but instead based on

00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:18,890
arbitrary properties of the items this

00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,349
becomes actually a powerful research

00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:24,170
tool rather than just a convenient way

00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:26,319
to have your configuration I can't hang

00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,319
out

00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,690
that would be a good addition I don't

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,400
have a collapse also I can't do it it's

00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:35,640
obviously but I would like to be able to

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,109
that's a that's a good idea and I have

00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,519
it I have a filter here my filter only

00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:40,410
works so at the moment you should be

00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:41,700
able to filter by any property including

00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,640
properties that are potentially not

00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,289
those being displayed in the grid at the

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:52,049
moment all I can really do is name so I

00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:54,049
can do did you get the idea filtering I

00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:58,019
don't claim this to be a new invention

00:35:54,049 --> 00:36:00,990
criminal tables didn't invent that my

00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:04,019
big contribution is I think Jacobs can

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:06,150
benefit from it and in fact just the

00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:08,760
idea of sorting and grouping on multiple

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,619
dimensions could potentially the other

00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,900
form factors as well some things will

00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:15,150
make sense as a grid but you know maybe

00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,299
if these are artifacts maybe you care so

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:20,430
much about the artifact state that you

00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:21,630
don't actually want to see it as a grave

00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,819
and it said you want to see it as some

00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,380
sort of progression now there might be a

00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:27,569
handful of other visualizations it might

00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,640
make sense but the first step is to be

00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:32,700
able to sort and group the entirety of

00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,160
items based on arbitrary attributes of

00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,319
those items so this is this is far and

00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,000
away the most future related thing that

00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:41,130
I'm going in to some degree why it's not

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,230
incorporated into the demo if you think

00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,309
about that and what's entailed in that

00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,720
there's a sort of a significant level of

00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:52,589
backend stuff that would have to happen

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,460
to enable a performant search sort and

00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:58,890
group but a but I think that's the right

00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,539
direction for the UI and a y'all's

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,430
enthusiasm about that kind of thing is

00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:05,519
the kind of thing that will sort of sort

00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:08,400
of help make it happen so so that's what

00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:10,289
I've got for the sort of demo demo stuff

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,210
Tom's got a little more to show you

00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:13,349
about the JavaScript module ization and

00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,650
a little bit more details about how that

00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:15,650
works

00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:27,299
right so the last part of the talk again

00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:30,499
so is the idea of solving the actual

00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:32,789
JavaScript modulation problem so as I

00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:34,769
Newell just worked in Jenkins coal or

00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:36,959
knows that didn't as I said earlier the

00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:38,940
javascript is in general totally on

00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:42,150
Marjorie's everything is thrown into a

00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:45,989
small handful of JavaScript files so I'm

00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:48,089
sorting that out is going it will make a

00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:52,170
lot of things a lot easier okay so I

00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:55,890
also we use a number of kind of third

00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:57,779
party or frameworks for a prototype jas

00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:00,329
and jquery at the moment they're just

00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:03,930
calm down to the global namespace which

00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:05,369
is not a good idea so fixing that

00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,469
problem is another thing that we think

00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:10,289
is pretty high on the list of priorities

00:38:07,469 --> 00:38:11,700
and I guess the main reason why some of

00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:14,459
these things happen is that there was no

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,670
kind of real established patterns or

00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:19,619
tools in terms of doing JavaScript

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:21,299
modulation budget was raised in the

00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:23,789
JavaScript so one of the things we've

00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:26,400
been doing in a couple of places in in

00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:28,559
jenkins potent Jenkins enterprise and in

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,289
also in the UI teams we're going to use

00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:34,289
it again here is the idea is the

00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:35,910
following idea of basically using no Jas

00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:37,079
modules so basically taking the job so

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,239
rather than putting the javascript in

00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:41,309
one big javascript file and doing your

00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,349
best to kind of make it look modular

00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:45,890
would in that file itself and then use

00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:48,719
and adjuncts and stuff to load it up in

00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:51,449
on your web page and jenkins so what we

00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:53,759
do is basically use follow the know Jas

00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:56,609
and pattern and build modules that way

00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:58,829
so common J's type modules and then use

00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:01,229
a tool called browser of voyages and

00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:02,789
very nifty tool out there it's an oj s

00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:06,299
program that basically allows you to

00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:08,640
take nor.j s modules and process them

00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:10,859
into a single bundle that can then be

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,779
loaded up in your browser okay so you've

00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:15,259
just a bill time tool so you get the

00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:17,729
benefit of the modularization but also

00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:18,970
at runtime it's not a whole lot of

00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:23,620
modules in the browser

00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:25,720
loaded separately ok so I'm that gets

00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,640
processed so building that down into

00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,590
your plugin and how do you actually

00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,620
accommodate that in your plugin so

00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,910
there's a another no Jas program out

00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,290
there basically for building

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,390
applications like this and it's called

00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,160
gold basically what it allows you it's

00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,890
kind of like made and for JavaScript if

00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,230
you're like it's rebuilding no GS type

00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:45,970
applications ok and then we were that

00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:49,570
into the actual you can wear that into

00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:52,630
your plug-in use and a maven plugin

00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:54,430
called front-end maven plugin okay so

00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,650
it's a pretty easy process to do when it

00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:59,200
ends up the end up with a nice more

00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:02,020
nicer and more modular JavaScript that's

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,730
easier to maintain okay and then you

00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,810
also get the benefit of course of being

00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:08,920
able to use loads of different no Jas

00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,810
frameworks out there and get the benefit

00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,320
of like moment Jas and stuff like that

00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:15,250
and so just to give you a quick look at

00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,960
they're not going to go into this in

00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:19,480
detail Jordan to just show you what that

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,400
looks like in the UI team is module

00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,990
itself okay so the fact that we gone

00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,060
down a majj the route as well that means

00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,710
we can start introducing our own like

00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:30,550
utility frameworks and stuff like that

00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:32,770
so in this case we've got that we kind

00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,960
of create a really lightweight MVC

00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,940
framework it's more like an MVC pattern

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,980
really that we follow for building stuff

00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,690
like this and we did the same in in the

00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,900
enterprise workflow extensions that

00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:45,880
Toby's provide so in the UI team is then

00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:50,200
basically at the top we can require this

00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,360
Jenkins jsm vc module and just this just

00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,450
ends up looking like bog standard no j s

00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:57,130
cold ok so it's then you can see the way

00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:00,490
we can separate out modular is the

00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:03,190
actual JavaScript into model controller

00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:05,680
model view controller type modules and

00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:07,450
we're using things like handlebars

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,590
templates we're doing the templating

00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:11,110
seoul-based we wouldn't claim say

00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:14,950
templating and using the rest api and it

00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:16,720
just makes rest calls to the backend to

00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:19,120
Jenkins to get the day their needs and

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,500
plain templates on the client side so

00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,860
that's the kind of pattern that we're

00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:26,650
gone within a number of places to solve

00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:28,720
the kind of modular ization issues so

00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,360
there's two minutes three nights left or

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,450
no hang on or any questions

00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:43,420
I want to go to the speaker maybe it's

00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:47,260
it easier for her people here how are

00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,820
the the user themes stored so does that

00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,770
require it like a database back-end or

00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,180
those stored flat files today is

00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:56,380
everything else in Jenkins yeah it's

00:41:52,180 --> 00:42:00,540
still rude in the users and users on the

00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,540
disk place if the part of users path yet

00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:06,220
hey so you you were showing that there

00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,900
was the buns on the left side and the

00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:11,680
buns on the right side but that was in

00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,970
the in the Jenkins enterprise is that

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,470
something you're contributing back to

00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:19,780
open source Jenkins or is that just for

00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:23,260
Jenkins enterprise yeah so that's some

00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:26,170
degree decision above my pay scale so

00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:28,180
certainly some significant portions will

00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,040
need to come back to the to the open

00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,870
sores and will need to probably even

00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,940
start in the open source because the

00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:36,910
hooks all need to be in route in court

00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:39,940
Jenkins then beyond that the specifics

00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:43,090
of you know what the style patterns are

00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,830
and you know what the bevels are on the

00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:48,190
buttons you know that sort of the artsy

00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:49,720
pieces you know that cloudbees is going

00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,880
to have to decide where they want to put

00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,780
their stamp on it but blobby kkkk

00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,570
actually I don't know if you know this

00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,860
but he carries a lot of weight in the

00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:59,140
McCloud news organization behind it

00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:00,880
Jenkins that objected community but most

00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:03,130
of it has to go into Jenkins core like

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,890
it just kind of work otherwise now that

00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:08,570
makes sense anyway I think it's good

00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:17,870
community thing to do okay thanks

00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:20,030
oh my question is about the one of the

00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:24,290
area where probably it's very model it

00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:28,190
again is the console output right yeah I

00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:29,630
mean how you can make it more easy to

00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,890
navigate and easy to troubleshoot

00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:33,980
because rather than looking at one

00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:36,020
monolithic file in context to how you

00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,780
provision it are what are the steps are

00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,670
within your job are especially in when

00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,160
you're like workload there is slightly

00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,590
better representation so how because

00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,680
that we have seen in our user it's

00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:50,870
troubleshooting it becomes tough with

00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,280
the driving at log file and also they

00:43:50,870 --> 00:44:00,670
searching sorting or thinks something

00:43:52,280 --> 00:44:00,670
you can do inside there yeah I'm thanks

00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:12,170
right yeah yeah cousin I work on that

00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:14,480
check yeah I just want to add one point

00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,040
there that this is the a long time ago

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,540
we added this extension point called

00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,670
console the note-taker that can

00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,800
drastically change the way the console

00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,780
advocates handle if you look at the ant

00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,280
for example it comprehends the target

00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,410
and the creates a table of contents

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,480
under that so we haven't these guys

00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,010
having to talk back yet but you know I

00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,830
think that would be another interesting

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:35,810
space ticket yeah so maybe I think you'd

00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:38,060
be probably only agenda at sample right

00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:40,880
yeah and the UI teams that stuff I did

00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,520
that on the console was like ten minutes

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,410
work I just broke up what was there and

00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,270
changed the colors of it and that was H

00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:49,340
and I didn't I didn't even look into the

00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:51,320
details I how the progressive logs and

00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,550
stuff like that work so i can really

00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,130
can't really answer that more than what

00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,990
cake is sorry yeah yeah so my question

00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:58,750
is around the Jenkins UI and the jobs

00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:02,270
like I know you shouldn't default to all

00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:03,800
but we do not but if one of our clients

00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,750
like hall and we have like hundreds of

00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,520
jobs is there anything that you're

00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:10,400
planning to do you are in terms of like

00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,140
pagination or anything lazy loading it

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,940
takes an awful long time so to

00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,190
imagination is kind of a universal

00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,590
problem and the problem gets all the

00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:21,950
more significant if as I'm advocating

00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:25,580
for we start with a sort of global

00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:29,270
context for things and a parse them down

00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,580
from there so what's the moral of the

00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:33,710
story we we see the pagination as being

00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:35,210
a significant issue I certainly don't

00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:36,890
have a solution for well we have

00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,630
actually developed there's a solution

00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,450
out there ready to go in for the build

00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,410
history so none of you noticed some of

00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:45,200
the changes you made to the build

00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:47,270
history widget and I'd know cool months

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,070
ago maybe to kind of clean up the layout

00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:51,080
of the hit build history widget it kind

00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:53,030
of aggravated a problem that was already

00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,740
there where basically if you've gotta

00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:57,140
build history would say a thousand bills

00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:59,180
or whatever in it load and that loading

00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,070
that in all if you hit the mower button

00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,810
at the bottom and it loaded the thousand

00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:05,030
that would like take forever so one of

00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:06,680
the pull request kind of hanging out

00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:08,990
there for good while that basically

00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,220
introduces the idea of pagination on the

00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:12,350
build history so you basically when you

00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,940
load up you get 30 or 40 whatever bills

00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:16,670
in it and you can page up and page down

00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,020
to those it adds like filtering to it so

00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,580
you can say you only want to see bills

00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,170
that have

00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:22,720
yield in the last week or in the last

00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:24,730
month or between certain dates or back

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,410
knitting so it but the moral of the

00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:28,240
story is that you never let your never

00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:32,680
actually loading over the way or more

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:35,020
than a handful of of data for a handful

00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,690
of different builds and the same but the

00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:39,550
same basic principle could apply for an

00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:41,290
imagination of any data like you've

00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,930
you've got a course or where are you

00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:46,660
where are you in the like what page are

00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:49,000
you on in the data set so you have a

00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,590
coarser to de and you're basically say I

00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,730
want to go up and are down from there

00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,590
and that kind of thing you know so it's

00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:56,020
the same navigate in the data should be

00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:58,200
pretty much the same problem can be

00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,850
solved and kind of a generally I guess I

00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,980
just have a common i created a very

00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:04,360
simple plug in a long time ago to deal

00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,160
with some UI stuff in the config page

00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,050
and i'm really excited that you're going

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,820
to kill it because this is so much

00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:12,490
better than you did not want me to

00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:20,550
create a UI on it so this is this is

00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:23,140
awesome so thanks Jamie come we didn't

00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:25,600
so I'm not sure what category this goes

00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,360
in necessarily if this is strictly you I

00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:33,430
but I think it's probably related not

00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:36,160
enough as as a developer who would be

00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:39,250
writing code and writing unit tests I

00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,040
kind of would like to see I would like

00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:45,190
to see the the health of what I bring

00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,930
into my projects so I'd like to see the

00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,540
number of the number of changes that

00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:51,750
I've committed that have been been

00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:54,340
tested the overall tests that are

00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,530
succeeding failing for my projects i

00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,880
would like that somehow surfaced first I

00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:59,920
don't know if there are plugins for this

00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,680
now or if this is something that can be

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,630
necessarily i guess brought up or if

00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:09,840
there's been any sort of desire for this

00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:12,370
by others but I I suppose it would add

00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,670
it would add again I guess a better

00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:19,180
sense of my impact on the system that's

00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:20,830
sort of how I see it is there any is

00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:23,680
there any sort of plan to get something

00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:26,590
like that or similar to that coming up

00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,210
in the future so so if I'm reading you

00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:30,940
right you're saying what you what you

00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:34,930
really want is to have a sort of user

00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:38,700
filter view of the world so your

00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:43,810
specific change sets your specific

00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:47,110
configuration changes so there isn't it

00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:48,700
we haven't specifically or at least as

00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:50,890
far as I know cloudbees hasn't

00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,350
specifically thought about users as a

00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,600
special attribute and as a special case

00:48:53,350 --> 00:49:00,460
it's a great special case it's a really

00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:02,890
good one but my hope would be that the

00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,050
first step anyway would be to getting

00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:07,150
you know as I've shown before general

00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:10,090
searching and sort sorting by attribute

00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:12,370
user would be one of those attributes so

00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:13,770
that would be a first generalized step

00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:15,970
but I think you're absolutely right that

00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,170
specializing you know making it like a

00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,360
super first-class entity

00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,040
what the user has done is really

00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,930
compelling what was that true Chris it

00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,460
was that your question or more so when

00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:27,080
you log into Jenkins you want to be able

00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:31,670
to control what you see when you get in

00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:34,850
um well to an extent yes it's a little

00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:36,140
bit of both I would like I realize now

00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:39,620
this isn't so much of a question as it

00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:45,620
is a desire well you want yeah that's

00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:48,850
fine I would like it to be more

00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:51,740
user-oriented i want i want the

00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:54,740
developer the user whoever's building

00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:57,040
stuff for testing stuff to to see what

00:49:54,740 --> 00:50:00,200
matters to them immediately and that's

00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,790
the projects that they work on the ones

00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:06,560
that they immediately care about they

00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:08,840
have access to and the general health or

00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,330
lack thereof of their contributions to

00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,930
those projects and so I would somehow

00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:17,510
like that surfaced as as graphs as

00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:19,850
metrics of these are the things that I

00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:22,130
am contributing and then now here is my

00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:25,010
list of the projects that I work so you

00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:28,580
mind if I ask the group does it seem

00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:32,590
compelling to everybody is ready yeah

00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,590
universally with the pause

00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,570
