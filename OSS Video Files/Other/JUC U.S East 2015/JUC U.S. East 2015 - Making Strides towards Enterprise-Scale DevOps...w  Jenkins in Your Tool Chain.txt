Moving to DevOps in large complex enterprise-IT environments is an incremental process. One that requires culture, process and technology. The "technology" part includes Jenkins, Nexus, Puppet, Docker and more. In this session, youâ€™ll hear about first-hand experiences building successful enterprise-scale DevOps practices and specifically looking at the role Jenkins played with other key technologies in the continuous tool chain. Learn about additional practices to support the goal of driving down cycle times. Finally, no DevOps practice is complete without accounting for compliance and security requirements. Jenkins plays a key role there, too.
