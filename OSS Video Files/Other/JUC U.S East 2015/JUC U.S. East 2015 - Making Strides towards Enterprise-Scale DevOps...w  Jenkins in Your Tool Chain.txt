Title: JUC U.S. East 2015 - Making Strides towards Enterprise-Scale DevOps...w  Jenkins in Your Tool Chain
Publication date: 2020-01-23
Playlist: JUC U.S East 2015
Description: 
	By: Curtis Yanko, Sonatype

Moving to DevOps in large complex enterprise-IT environments is an incremental process. One that requires culture, process and technology. The "technology" part includes Jenkins, Nexus, Puppet, Docker and more. In this session, youâ€™ll hear about first-hand experiences building successful enterprise-scale DevOps practices and specifically looking at the role Jenkins played with other key technologies in the continuous tool chain. Learn about additional practices to support the goal of driving down cycle times. Finally, no DevOps practice is complete without accounting for compliance and security requirements. Jenkins plays a key role there, too.

so thanks for coming out so we're here

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:23,630
to talk about really you know Jenkins is

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,460
a great starting point it's so versatile

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,500
there's so much you can do with it the

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,029
price is right you know so you can you

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,770
can pull off the host shadow IT thing

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,449
and sneak it in and you know show off

00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,370
some cool things and generate some

00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,620
interest and that's largely what this

00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,420
talk about but for any of you Bullwinkle

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,129
fans out there every everything needs

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,410
two titles right so not only is this

00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,750
about making strides towards

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,190
enterprise-scale I really this is a talk

00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,019
that's been kicking around my head for

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,059
probably at least a year now and it's

00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:52,400
the idea of a DevOps minimal Viable

00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:55,129
Product right and and I and I've been

00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,620
you know on the circuit a lot at DevOps

00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:59,089
days and you know a lot of conferences

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,970
and there's a lot of people showing up

00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:04,369
and wanting to understand what it is and

00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,810
how do you get started right and I'm not

00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,760
going to try and tell you what it is but

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,650
I do think I can help you understand how

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,869
to get started and Jenkins has a lot to

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:17,990
do with that so just just as kind of set

00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:19,550
the tone here really everything for me

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,800
centers around the idea of setting up a

00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,950
software factory and a couple years ago

00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,710
I was sort of a lone voice against a lot

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,080
of the sort of DevOps luminaries on in

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,870
the Twitterverse on this notion of a dev

00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,860
ops team and and the send the tools even

00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:38,630
being important now now having said that

00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,640
DevOps is ninety percent change and ten

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,050
percent tools but we're not going to

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,000
have that ninety percent change without

00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,370
the tools therefore we can't overlook

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,170
them it reminds me a lot of an old Uncle

00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,750
Bob Martin article if anyone remembers

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,520
the land that scrum forgot and he talked

00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,990
about the necessity of tools even though

00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,580
agile teams could go out and do whatever

00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,200
and we didn't want to like really tell

00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,970
you what to do there were certain things

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,770
like unit testing and certain things

00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,720
that were just a given and we kind of

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,420
had to accept and I think the software

00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,340
factory is that for the DevOps and

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,989
because we're going to use it as a

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,819
platform and hopefully this becomes more

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:13,370
apparent as I go we're going to use it

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:15,440
as a platform to make the work visible

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,180
right if we start to automate things we

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,489
have a codified process that we can look

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,280
at and understand it's not a mystery or

00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:25,069
a black box that other people do behind

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,900
a ticketing system that transparency is

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,580
going to start to drive collaboration

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,819
right when we'll get more into this but

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,439
now

00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,409
that we have something we can look at we

00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,969
can talk about it and and the other big

00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,859
thing that people are seeing is this is

00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:38,689
the opportunity the software factories

00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:40,849
really the opportunity to build quality

00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:42,980
and I'm using quality as a huge umbrella

00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:45,560
term that includes you know audit

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,019
concerns and legal concerns and security

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,370
concerns I plump all of those things

00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:53,329
under the quality umbrella and just so

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,010
that there's something that actually

00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:57,019
comes out of this this is really based

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,409
on the last couple of years of work that

00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:03,950
I've done not my current employer and

00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:05,239
the results are stuff that we saw and

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,400
we'll get to that where we were able to

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,349
drive down mean time to detection really

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,349
drive down mean time to remediation a

00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:15,799
massive reduction in rhe were driving up

00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:17,359
quality and all of that regained rework

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,269
and we'll talk about this at the end

00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:22,430
with the people really led to increased

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,379
productivity increase innovation and a

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,169
lack of feeling overwhelmed everyone in

00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:28,519
IT is like too busy to do the things

00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:30,620
they know they need to do because

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,959
they're just trying to stay afloat right

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:37,609
so this is a way to sort of undo that

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:40,340
cycle but again I don't want to ignore

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:42,439
culture right so I will try to take some

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,720
time to define culture a little bit to

00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,269
me so culture outside of the workplace

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,650
involves the music and how we dress and

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,470
you know it involves a lot of things

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,720
inside the workplace it's largely just

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,370
our shared norms what's acceptable

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,229
what's not acceptable in our company and

00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,939
how we talk about that right and it

00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:00,590
comes up in a lot of the you know the

00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,299
state of the DevOps report do you shoot

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,220
the messenger do you know is a

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,069
degenerative culture do you try to learn

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,019
blameless post-mortems right really

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,109
which is just what are the norms and how

00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:16,099
do we talk about it so while I don't

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:18,889
know a good way to just tell you how to

00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:21,169
go change a culture I do think that if

00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,870
we do something that changes people's

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:25,520
behaviors and we start to get picky

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,280
about the words we use and change the

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,139
language around it then a culture will

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,419
have to shift and I think it'll go in

00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,039
the direction we want and for me the

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,830
software factory the tooling the

00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:39,469
unimportant part is the platform and the

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,539
catalyst for all of that right because

00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:42,560
it's going to change the way people

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:44,510
operate is going to change the way they

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,250
think about it and it's going to drive

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,380
that transparency in that collaboration

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,030
so we're going to talk about a tool

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,060
chain of software factory but this is

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,830
really how to start the cultural change

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,460
right we're going to change the behavior

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,780
is going to change their language and

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,669
just the level set we're going to talk

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,830
about a Minimum Viable Product so well

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:06,470
we all know that DevOps looks like a car

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,240
we can maybe agree on that I am not

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,790
telling you what the wheels look like

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,340
here I'm maybe getting us to a bicycle

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,889
right this might be a bicycle it's not

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,510
going to look like you know DevOps in

00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:20,750
the end but I do think it's going to

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,700
give you something to realistically make

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:27,110
it seem like it's within reach by the

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,389
time we get to the end of this so this

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,450
was my validating moment and the 2014

00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:34,669
state of the DevOps report this was

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,860
about the time the community gave up the

00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:38,570
idea that dev ops teams were evil this

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,210
is about the time they started to

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,800
understand what's actually happening in

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,200
most shops that were trying to head down

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,450
this journey and they came up in the

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,220
tail end of the not the original report

00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,320
but the findings that was given at the

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,240
velocity conference later they came up

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,550
with this rubric right and this is sort

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,710
of Jean Kim and Nicole and all those

00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,970
they right they analyzed all the data

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,340
and they came and told us what they

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,200
thought about it and and the number one

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,669
surprise to them was the importance of

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,560
version controlling your artifacts

00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:09,080
moving into your environments right that

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,150
that that was a better indicator than

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,740
source code control like if you you

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,720
could skip source code control and

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,190
version your artifacts and you would be

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,050
better off right that was a shocking

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,240
finding as far as they were concerned it

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,680
was a and you see it's in every category

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,180
is like version control version control

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,360
version control right if I didn't

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,919
mention it virgin control your artifacts

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,660
where I think they sort of Miss depth is

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,100
I don't like continuous delivery up

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,360
there as a deployment frequency

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,010
throughput because to me that's a

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,990
superset we're all here trying to get to

00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,400
continuous delivery and continuous

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,660
deliveries a little bit of a holy grail

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,039
because there's a whole lot of things

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,740
you've got to do to get the continuous

00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:45,020
delivery and I think what they meant to

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,850
say is that it was just deployment

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,320
automation what name yeah you know

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,789
continuous is like one of my least

00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,510
favorite words right now because I feel

00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:54,890
we abuse it left and right I just feel

00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,880
it's really over you is everything he

00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,240
wants to be continuous we're gonna have

00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,259
continued

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,250
improvement we have continuous

00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,569
integration we have continuous delivery

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,789
we're going to continuously talk about

00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:04,039
continuous pneus and it sort of gets old

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,919
after a while but i will say deployment

00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:09,919
automation is going to be key and if we

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:12,979
just start in that quadrant on those two

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,590
things with our software factory we can

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:17,630
really put a dent we can show value we

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,949
can start to justify funding and get

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,180
initiatives off the ground and that's

00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,319
what really this is about we're going to

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,270
look at a tool chain that costs

00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,830
virtually nothing and it's going to

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,940
allow you to demonstrate some value and

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,099
then you can get some money to go by

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,840
cloudbees instead of just jenkins you're

00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:31,610
going to be able to you know go up on

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,979
all the other tools and buy a release

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,229
automation tool so so keep that in mind

00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,699
this to me was very validating this is

00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,310
where we're focused on I think this is

00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:44,120
where you start and it's based on my own

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:46,069
experience um so this is so this

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,169
predates this this is anyone who read

00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:50,590
continuous delivery Jess humble and um

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,000
I've always forget the other guy's name

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,409
there was two different parts they

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
talked about one was the value stream

00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:57,919
they outlined the value stream is being

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,469
billed deployed test and released and we

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,469
can we can argue the nuances but that's

00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:05,210
what was in that book and then in the

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:06,800
book they've specifically said you have

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,210
to funk you know you have to decompose

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,280
your applications and we can

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,620
functionally decompose virtually any

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,719
application into code config data and

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,669
then they said environment right and

00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:18,409
environments obviously a pretty big term

00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:20,780
I like to spike it out a little bit

00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:21,800
better because I like to talk about you

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,020
know where there's a platform layer

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,520
there's an infrastructure layer there's

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,229
opportunities that even while you're

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,930
just doing deployment automation maybe

00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:32,450
just static environments that other work

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,029
can be can be going on and and let me

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,529
just back up a step all of this was done

00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:38,479
in the context of a traditional non

00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:40,969
technology company right so I'm at an

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,800
insurance company before these guys are

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,870
really slow and behind so that that's

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,120
sort of my backdrop if if you're coming

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,589
from more of an engineering culture you

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,060
know maybe this doesn't you know you

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:51,230
probably don't have these problems and

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,850
you know this talk will be a lot less

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:58,160
interesting to you so in that in that

00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,839
vein though and specifically saying

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,880
we're keeping testing out a scope I am

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,640
NOT going to try to tackle testing

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,040
testing is the long pole in the tent in

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,420
my opinion it's the hardest thing of all

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,070
of this to do because there's so many

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,260
facets of it there's so many things that

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,820
to be done lots of different platforms

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,670
lots of different apps lots of different

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,130
needs there's not a sort of a you know a

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,860
one methodology to test them all that I

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,720
know of anyway so we will talk briefly

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,540
about just a little bit about testing

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,690
but um but we're just going to focus on

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:35,390
how do we build deploy and release code

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:37,570
config and data so here's my sort of

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:41,360
high-level this to me is what most

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,770
traditional non-technical companies are

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,650
up against you got lots of static

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:48,230
environments all over the place how many

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,970
you have in your sdlc varies I came from

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,010
a place that had as many as nine I

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,800
talked to customers these days that have

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,080
even more than that not really sure why

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,670
but this is sort of the idea but we

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,380
fundamentally know that we have source

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,300
code control right everyone to use in

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,100
source code control it's feeding into

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,070
our build system we're all here because

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,020
of Jenkins Jenkins right and why would

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:12,200
you not use Jenkins is sort of beyond me

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,120
at least as a starting point um a little

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,740
homage to us but some kind of binary

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,060
manager right you got you got to manage

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,410
the consumption of your components you

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,690
need a place to store the things you're

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,910
building and then I've generically put

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:25,250
ara out there as application release

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,050
automation but the good news is Jenkins

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,790
can do that too at least initially I'm

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,470
I'm not really sure it's sort of the end

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,750
goal State I'm not sure it was

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,390
purpose-built with release automation in

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,370
mine and I'm aware that a lot of a lot

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,950
of shops are successful with it in that

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,510
role but with the rise of so many other

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,180
tools in that space and as you become

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,380
more you know sort of dynamic we'll have

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,880
to see if it actually becomes the

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,380
deployment automation or if it's just

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,840
the orchestration on top of it or

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,190
something else sonar is another one of

00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,890
these tools it's just in every shop

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,810
sonar you know sonar and Jenkins are the

00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,220
two tool you walk into a shop everybody

00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,660
has Jenkins everybody has sonar it's

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,280
literally like ninety-five percent or

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,380
something like I ran into the first

00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,810
customer ever the other day that wasn't

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,850
using it and hadn't heard of it those

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,500
sort of taken aback by that and really

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,360
when we so this whole goal of the

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,920
software factory though is to find a way

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,630
to build quality and right we want to

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,430
wrap it all in governance we want to get

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,680
all of our stakeholders to the table and

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,140
ask them what they need to sleep at

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,820
night that has to be in here so you know

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,510
what about our code scans what about

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,430
call

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,200
reports what about a code review process

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,720
how are we addressing our legal

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,570
obligations or awareness around our

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,040
legal you know open source consumption

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,530
audit what does audit care about you

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,990
know so it's a chance to use this

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,480
platform to say let's bring people to

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,180
the table and talk about what we have to

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,580
do in our automated factory that'll let

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,560
you sleep at night right so how can we

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,360
build it in bake it in and we want the

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,550
machines doing it we don't want humans

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,320
going to some word doc checking off some

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,380
things saying yeah you know I'm doing my

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,150
little step and it involves me manually

00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,650
sort of inspecting things and then you

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,240
know putting a document in SharePoint or

00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,030
something that does not work it doesn't

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,430
scale it can keep up so we have to

00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,660
automate all of the things right a hat

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,360
we have to figure out a way to get it

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,670
all in here now as you become more you

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,020
know sort of dynamic provisioning stuff

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,490
maybe you have environments actually

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,990
feeding your source code control maybe

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,970
you're doing some more provisioning and

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,820
testing off at Jenkins like I said we

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,680
could we can you know around on

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:30,490
this but in general this is sort of what

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:35,750
a factory looks like so with all that

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:37,340
context you know I took a team chartered

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,440
we had a you know we had a high-profile

00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,180
application that we were chartered with

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,590
so we were that team that was allowed to

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,650
break the rules right this was a

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,300
strategically important project had to

00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:50,270
get out it was going to differentiate

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,490
our company so teams like mine were

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,870
allowed to go around ops and do things

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,520
that other teams weren't but it also

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,600
meant that it gave us a chance to

00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,090
demonstrate the art of the possible

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,710
right I gave us a chance to show that

00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:04,160
there was a different or better way to

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:06,560
do things so my sort of mantra to my

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,330
team was how do we get to zero touch

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,700
deployments right and at first that was

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,290
a huge challenge we we had some awful

00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,150
systems you had to look at like the log

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,560
and see when a cache was primed before

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,110
you could move on so we had to write no

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,070
log parsers and you know it was the

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,600
first one was really really hard and

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,670
then we kind of quickly learned when now

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,990
we have to rethink our use of snapshots

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,220
and stuff like that we really want to

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,690
start everything needs to be a release

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,220
candidate we got to start versioning at

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:35,000
the beginning of the process not sort of

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:37,040
at the tail end and the key is it had to

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,019
be for code config and data the

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,120
benefits that I'm going to talk about at

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:43,970
the end do not happen if you don't do

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,970
all three and we'll get more into that

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,589
near the tail end but if if you just did

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,110
code config and gate is still had a

00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:53,240
traditional path you won't get any of

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,519
the benefits it just falls apart it has

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,380
to be automated together we have to talk

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,380
about specific versions of each things

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,850
that we're moving here I mentioned we

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,980
can we can use Jenkins as that

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,529
application release automation you know

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,230
it has the ssh plugin you can you know

00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:10,370
it's not it's not fancy but you can get

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,899
you know whatever you need done and

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,509
there's other sort of tools that can

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,339
help with that at least pieces of it but

00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:18,620
it will allow you to do it and my

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,089
company though the idea of a button in

00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,410
jenkins that could push code to some

00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:23,209
environments scared the hell out of them

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,459
so you know we had to eventually kind of

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:26,990
back away from that but in terms of

00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,779
demonstrating the fact that it's even

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,670
possible that it can be done is

00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,500
fantastic right because then because

00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,730
then i do get to the benefits and i can

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,490
get the funding to get you know the

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,720
things i need so the other thing is

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,130
we're going to talk about creating a

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,170
view of what's where I mentioned support

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,850
start small again I was in a fairly you

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,500
know one line of business couple of

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,899
important apps I wasn't trying to tackle

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,310
the enterprise portfolio yet so in terms

00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:51,079
of creating a view of what's where and

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,720
this was a really clever thing I was

00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:56,240
really proud of one of my one of my sort

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,250
of new college hires figured out is um

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,709
we were able to just make a grid not

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,889
unlike this a little actually a little

00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:05,779
cruder but more information in

00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:08,089
confluence and then there's a plugin in

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,760
jenkins that can go update a confluence

00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,170
page so i made a grid and you got to put

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,819
all these tokens and every one of these

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,180
spots and a little tedious to set the

00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:18,680
first one up but every time I pushed a

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:22,370
component to an environment it updated a

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,490
Jenkins page this this was in and of

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:27,649
itself kind of monumental this was just

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,680
was like changed everything for all the

00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,480
stakeholders because nobody kept asking

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,920
me for latest this was always the bane

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,509
of my existence i've been in build and

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,860
release management for 18 years and i

00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:39,019
always got people coming he said kurt i

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,939
need the latest code in this environment

00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:42,740
and i'd always really cool so when you

00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,899
say latest you mean like what was tested

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,760
is it in the dev environment he wants it

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,620
to move or do you know somebody that

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,089
just committed some code like what do

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,970
you mean by latest right

00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,680
help me out this fundamentally changed

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,230
all of those conversations to now

00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,740
everybody talked about specific versions

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:04,670
I want this version of the database I

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,139
want the collection of versions in QA it

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,999
also meant a lot of my stakeholders

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,009
understood that our app was made up of

00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:12,199
more than one thing or two things it was

00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:14,930
actually made up of five database

00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,879
schemas multiple servers a front end of

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,220
middleware and it was also kind of

00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,959
spelled out to a lot of stakeholders had

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,339
no clue they were like I was wondered

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,019
about that you know so now they could

00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,480
see like there's the all these were the

00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:27,829
pieces that made this app up and these

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,649
are the versions that we're talking

00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:32,300
about very something very specific now

00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:34,370
my later environments could go they

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,529
typically would just look at QA say Kurt

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,480
I want those versions what's in QA we're

00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,589
having a prescriptive dialogue now when

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,170
I deliver it to them there's no

00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,550
surprises right so and this was a great

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,139
low-tech solution like you know just

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,480
have Jenkins update a confluence page

00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:49,939
you can create a basic what's where and

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,860
that's you know that's like a basic

00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:53,749
prominent of itself most shops can't

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,279
tell you what version of what's where

00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:57,019
it's just sort of like yeah the latest

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,300
of the May branch is over here and

00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,740
June's over there but you know I'm not

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,999
really sure exactly which one it is

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,730
because they're all snapshots or

00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:08,390
something like that so this was a big

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:11,929
deal for us so now deployment automation

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:14,179
right so to get their deployment

00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:16,250
automation to me was just the real it

00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,490
was the thing that made it happen so

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,049
even though I had license to do this

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:24,949
without you know sort of people's

00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:26,750
permission um really what it meant was I

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,220
still went out to those folks that I was

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,140
allowed to sort of ignore and I made

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,779
sure I included them and we just started

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,640
talking about like okay well you know my

00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:36,049
system administrator is you know we're

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,820
gonna need a landing zone we're gonna

00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:39,559
need a place to put stuff right and then

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,149
I want to talk to my middle where folks

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,390
what IDs are you using and what how do

00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:46,370
you do deploys and you know and and we

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,799
got us talking across these boundaries

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,360
no longer was it submitted ticket right

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,399
that ticket actually spawned off three

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,110
more tickets you have no idea what's

00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:55,940
going on eventually they tell you the

00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,280
invite and then you you know you realize

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,270
it doesn't run this was like you know

00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,650
this just started that cross silo

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:06,800
talking this was me on the delivery

00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:09,440
side talking to two of my ops partners

00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,610
talking to my prod support people

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,140
because this was going to hit them in

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,700
the end don't forget your prod support

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,650
people get them involved early don't

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,620
show up on the doorstep of prod with a

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,240
new thing and the dba's for the first

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,610
time we're actually we're bringing the

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,080
DBA conversation into right and that's a

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,060
case there's another you know if you

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,830
don't know about liqui base it's another

00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,960
free tool it can start to version your

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,980
schemas you can start to check in you

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,020
know those things with code you can

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,240
package them up and have a deployment

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,860
automation that starts to guarantee you

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,750
can remake your database from scratch

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,290
you know what version each database is

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:44,630
at and now and now when I deploy I have

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:47,090
a known good version of code with a

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,190
known good version of data with a known

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,530
good version of config and when that's

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:56,810
all known good and dev and I move it to

00:18:51,530 --> 00:19:02,000
QA and it doesn't work real quick what's

00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:03,770
the problem anyone know right well it's

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,720
always the environment well it's the

00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,670
config right the one piece the data and

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,320
the code was good we've just forgot the

00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,730
config and this was our most common

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,110
thing right we'd get it all working in

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,970
dev we go to promote it and it wasn't

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,590
everything I action but then we would

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,270
take the time to fix the config for not

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,630
only QA but every other environment

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,280
right and so now think about that most

00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,610
of my problems were happening endeavour

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,870
QA and I think we talked about that and

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,730
we were fixing them fast because there

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,130
was only one real suspect in the room

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:34,430
anymore my other things were sort of

00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,780
known good so the suspect was wow you

00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,760
know it's probably just configured it

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,280
changed the dynamic we used to go from

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,290
you know late in the testing cycle we're

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,890
trying to update you 80 we're up against

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,900
it the environment doesn't come up so

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,210
what do you do well you naturally get

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,830
your two most expensive developers and

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,710
you have them start figuring it out

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:57,500
right and it takes hours right and

00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:00,020
you're and you're just sweating it now I

00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,940
go from that to I gotta cut I got the

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,590
college in turn on the summer or saying

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,420
you know what go look at the config fix

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,550
it and redeploy the config for me right

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,560
I mean it went literally from two of my

00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:13,010
most expensive resources spending hours

00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,630
to slightly over state it but you know

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,520
the summer intern could fix it in

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,540
minutes in most cases maybe I doubt

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,490
someone

00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,049
and this you know so what have we done

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,660
now we've started to make the end-to-end

00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:26,700
process of how code becomes a product

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,290
visible to everyone right and we're

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,460
having these conversations and that's

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,290
why I'm saying this is like the

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,059
beginning of DevOps because it sort of

00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,090
forces these conversations that happen

00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,770
if and it can be hard at first right it

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,540
was hard to get the x and people are

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,010
really questioning everything you get a

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,080
lot of questions around well can we you

00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,030
know what about Sox what about PCI what

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,130
about you know can we even do this you

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,770
know but you can slug through it right

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:53,040
you can slug through these things the

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,990
test that I did go for acceptance tests

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,660
so once i got my deployment automation

00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,580
going I kind of looked at my QA partners

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,990
I'm like you guys run some kind of

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,640
acceptance test I'm assuming you run

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,559
something before you begin testing right

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,120
and of course you know they did they had

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,530
you know it's basic stuff can you log in

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,419
can you do this can you do the kid a

00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,830
couple dropdowns hit all the tabs yeah

00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,780
it looks like it's you know everything's

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:15,510
talking to everything it looks like it's

00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:18,630
suitable to test may may suck but it's

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:21,419
suitable to test um so we partnered with

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,860
them real quick and said no we can we

00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:25,950
can call these tests right we can add

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,690
this as another step so that was the one

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,429
and then we did is we partner with them

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,900
on how to sort of abstract them so they

00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:33,120
could be run against any environment

00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,410
their tests tended to be sort of focused

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,520
just on their environment or they were

00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,440
sort of hard coded for other

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,850
environments and so we just sort of

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,740
partner with them brought in some extra

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,900
you know programming horsepower and

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,880
helped him make it so those in our case

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,460
it was probably the HP testing tool

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,049
which I loathe but it was something like

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,160
that we learned how to parameterize it

00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,360
so we could say run the test against

00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,580
this environment now run the same test

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,230
against that environment right so that

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,179
was the one thing we work on and that

00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,500
was huge cuz think about this it went

00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,540
from me just sort of thing you know

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,640
trying to do a whole bunch of steps

00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,890
bringing an environment up half the time

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,110
it didn't come up even when it did maybe

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,690
it wasn't suitable for testing now I

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,370
went from saying I've done my job can

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,840
you check it out to now I'm saying not

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,400
only have I done my job but I've checked

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,860
it out and I know it's ready for you

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,020
right so my job is that code Stuart the

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,090
guy that was moving all this around I

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,620
was giving a much more positive handoff

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,230
I was giving him something I knew had

00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,880
met at least some minimum criteria and

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,650
it was suitable for them to waste start

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,880
spending time on and not waste time on

00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,790
because if you know I don't know if

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,800
anyone's been involved in

00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,180
effort you have an army of QA people

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,350
working for days only to find out you

00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,550
didn't have what you needed it was all a

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:41,170
waste right you know so I've been there

00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:45,760
but deployment automation is big and so

00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:47,200
here's the results that we saw first of

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,060
all I mean you know we automated so a

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,010
deployment time shrunk dramatically I'm

00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,510
going to just say fifty percent it ran I

00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,060
mean there was cases where things got

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:57,040
sped up by you know hundreds of percent

00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,050
but they were just truly awful processes

00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,340
there was other cases where they didn't

00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,050
really speed up all that much because

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,520
they were pretty decent processes to

00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,980
start with and I was just calling their

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,830
process so there's not a lot of gain but

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,600
sort of in the aggregate although you

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,580
know I'm gonna point out another example

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,170
later like eight hours to two hours but

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,820
let's just say roughly I could just say

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,520
we were cutting fifty percent off all of

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:22,000
our deployment times now and and I was

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,770
having a I literally went from a 50-50

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,510
shot at an environment starting we

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,430
tracked this when we were sort of still

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,930
doing things by hand it was like 5050

00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,370
was a coin toss whether or not it would

00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,770
even come up let alone pass the

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,470
acceptance test and we went to less than

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:38,380
ten percent and it was always config and

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:41,950
it always took minutes to fix right so

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,720
that was a huge win so all my MTG D is

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,030
now having endeavour QA for the most

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,640
part we were very rarely surprised in

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:51,040
any environment after QA like I said you

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,570
know so you get sucked into the dev you

00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,220
forget to go to QA with something but

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,690
when you fix it you don't you don't wait

00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,460
to you know smack your head on the wall

00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,470
again you fix all the other environments

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,210
with that config and sometimes that's

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,350
interesting because the config is you

00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,430
know that even the development team

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,510
doesn't know it for the upper

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,980
environment so you've got to start to

00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,450
talk to you know some solution

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,770
architects or some other folks and make

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,640
sure we're getting the right values in

00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:14,530
all the environments again mttr from

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,770
hours to minutes it's not exaggerating

00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:20,710
and overall we were able to sort of

00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:23,500
quantify that we felt we took about just

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:27,210
forty percent of pure waste out of our

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:29,800
process of churn of noise of

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,620
firefighting of nonsense right of all

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,060
the stuff we hate as IT professionals

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,650
all the stuff that was getting in the

00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,330
way from us to doing the work we really

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,910
wanted to do we're cleaning up other

00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,950
people's messes right so it was it was

00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:45,480
pretty freaking significant right as

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,480
forty percent is a lot

00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,890
but the more profound effect of all is

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,230
so that was great that look you know so

00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,179
time is money I can make a case we can

00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,820
do some math on the burden labor rate I

00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,230
can just I can start to say we saved we

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,250
saved your six million dollars last year

00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,590
right I mean it was just straight-up

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,270
math it was sort of empirical it was

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,770
logical you couldn't really argue it we

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,290
could you know fudge the numbers a

00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:12,280
little but the more important thing was

00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:15,250
that culturally like people went from

00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:18,610
being completely overwhelmed to all of a

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,950
sudden feeling like really empowered

00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,870
like really engaged like really excited

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,130
again to come to work right instead of

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,110
like oh Jesus Christ you know its

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,460
deployment weekend you know so as less

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,720
of that is like I you know deployment

00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,920
weekend that's not a big deal i just hit

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,020
a bunch of buttons i'm gonna watch

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,080
everything make sure it goes so it

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,630
changed people's attitude i had dba's

00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,240
you know we were all of a sudden free

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,440
from you know just waiting and we could

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,540
start to then turn around and say what

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,490
can i improve what can I work on what

00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,740
else can I do you know it gave you that

00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,510
extra bandwidth that forty percent was

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,360
that bandwidth you always wanted but

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,920
never had in fact you were probably Oh

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,330
burning over an extra ten twenty percent

00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,309
just to keep up with all the

00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,050
firefighting so these you know these

00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:00,670
people just didn't feel overwhelmed

00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,160
anymore they and they started to really

00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,630
go from feeling like hey I can fix and

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,040
do other things that I can come back to

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,870
Curt and say you know what else can I

00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,340
work on it maybe we can do this and

00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,830
maybe we can do it was a totally

00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:15,250
different atmosphere of you know just

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:16,750
complete defeat to now feeling engaged

00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,670
and for animal if anyone's read the Lean

00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,290
Enterprise there's the whole talk about

00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,450
the Chevy plant there was it was really

00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,250
just like that like when Toyota took

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,830
over the Chevy plant one of the criteria

00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,450
they had was they used all the same

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,220
people and it was like the worst Chevy

00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,620
plan of them all like drinking on the

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,960
job it was a union job it was the lowest

00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:38,590
productivity and Toyota to make their

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,690
point said it's really about people and

00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,190
if you and to prove it to you we want to

00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,720
bring all the same people back and

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,670
there's all these great testimonials in

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,050
that book from people that worked at

00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:50,080
that plant that talked about how it

00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:52,179
changed their lives not just at work but

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,130
at home right like it changed their

00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:55,929
attitude about the world around them so

00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,460
anyone who has if you haven't read that

00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:59,230
it's a great book

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,029
you want to understand the lean stuff

00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:06,190
that work that we're trying to drive to

00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:08,919
arm and then my last but you know once

00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:11,710
you get people on this button they don't

00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,409
go back like it might be a hard time to

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:17,860
get them to the button it can be a long

00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:20,409
kind of uphill battle but once they have

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,970
a button then they want a button for

00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:23,260
everything else to write like that now

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,429
all of a sudden you're like well I'm I'm

00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,080
tired of this old because that's

00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:27,460
nonsense i want the button the buttons

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,860
awesome fire-and-forget fire-and-forget

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,480
right and every so often it goes off the

00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,690
rails you clean it up in your fire again

00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,799
you know it's like so powerful so so

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,390
that's the thing and that and then again

00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:39,460
it's the culture so now we have a

00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:43,120
different shared norm the shared norm is

00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:47,200
now the button not the spreadsheet right

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,520
not the word doc and in don't get me

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,830
wrong there's a lot more to go on you

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,840
know going on but it was just dramatic

00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,029
even at that level the change in

00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,370
people's attitude and what now have

00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:59,529
become the new norm just because we

00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:02,649
tackled some basic deployment automation

00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:04,539
in a handful of cases and then it just

00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:06,179
spread like wildfire from there we're

00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:10,929
now we're looking for every opportunity

00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:12,520
what else can I automate next so after

00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:13,990
this so you get to hear now you're up

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,360
against the real challenge which is

00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,850
scale right and I don't have a lot to

00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,039
say on this I trip on scale as much as

00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:23,340
the next person but you know if you're

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,960
in a large company you probably have

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,240
hundreds if not more different

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,799
middleware platforms etl platforms

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:35,110
databases web servers es bees you know

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,600
be pm's the list goes on right i mean

00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:39,250
you know if you're in a big company you

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,890
start to boggle at just how many

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:44,500
different technologies and things that

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,690
you're using so you have to just keep

00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,429
chipping away like you know once you can

00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,899
solve for deploying to tomcat you can

00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,880
deploy to any other tomm cap and then

00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:54,190
you got to go work on you know the

00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,200
bigger jboss or a websphere or something

00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,820
else right so so there's no end of work

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,970
but at least now you have the time to

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,789
deal with it tackling automated testing

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:06,159
now seems doable I've taken out that

00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:08,440
noise now the idea of really making a

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,320
run at fixing testing doesn't seem like

00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,760
a stretch it doesn't seem like

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,870
you know sort of like that'd be great

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,220
but we're never going to do it we've

00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:18,010
tried that like 10 times it's never

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,780
worked now you think maybe just maybe we

00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:23,080
can do it right you can start to go

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,060
after that and then now the idea now we

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,280
can talk about continuous delivery right

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:30,280
now we're in a place where we can have a

00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,960
realistic discussion about what it takes

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,030
to get from where you are which is just

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,590
basic deployment automation to

00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,210
continuous delivery which is larger than

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,220
what testing right i mean testings the

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,690
big ones example we automate that now

00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,190
things just sort of keep buttons for our

00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:45,040
pushing buttons when they finish right

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,840
nor they don't if it fails so so that's

00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,400
the thing and I don't think I have

00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,440
anything more than that I'm keeping it

00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,580
short and sweet thanks for your time

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,410
although I will you know if there's any

00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,760
we have actually we're ready the half

00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,890
hour mark that's pretty good as I was

00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,630
shooting for um if there's any kind of

00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,230
questions or answers or something I'm

00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:04,540
sure I've glossed over a lot of details

00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:08,400
we need to decompose any application

00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:11,320
into code config and data yeah so we

00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,890
understands how to do it was how to do

00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,350
continuous integration with the code

00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:19,330
conflict too but what was the data okay

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,100
excellent so he what he said asking from

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,200
code configured data was my

00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,050
decomposition he's comfortable with code

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,060
and config but what about the data bit

00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:30,520
that's where I mentioned that to a tool

00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,020
like liquid base a free tool at the end

00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,540
of the day what the problem domain looks

00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,610
like is this or what the solution domain

00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,230
looks like there's a table in your

00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,720
database that tells you what version

00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,640
it's at your tool looks at that table

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,320
and says I you're at version X and I

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,580
need to get you to version why let me

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,840
apply these that way because as you go

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,420
through your environment they're all at

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,880
different baselines so now you take that

00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,770
off the off the plate and if you can if

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,840
you get even fancier liquid base has

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,370
stuff like certain things will always be

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,530
run so other things will only be run

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,780
once you know but the bottom line is

00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:08,560
it's you're basically also versioning

00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:10,240
that code and database in particular

00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,150
when I inherited was was a nightmare

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,150
literally developers would send you know

00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:18,580
sequel to the DBA who would file it in

00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,380
his email and then when you asked him to

00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:23,590
update an environment he would go in and

00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,820
look at the tables he'd be like an index

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,009
so I must have done that

00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:30,070
man looks like that columns there so I'm

00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:32,320
guessing you just need these hence my

00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:36,730
fifty percent success rate with code and

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,259
data right so yeah I mean liquid base

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,730
there's some other great high-end tools

00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:40,990
after that but again if you know just

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,019
start out prove the art of the possible

00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:46,029
use something like a liquid base oh

00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:47,769
there you go yeah a lot of your talk is

00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,840
non-technical obviously and that's cool

00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:51,190
so I have a non technical question what

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,750
do you do when management finds out

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,399
you've got an extra six hours a night on

00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,899
build night and when they you cut forty

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,460
percent of your waist how do you keep

00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:58,870
them from sucking all that up you know

00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,629
work expands to fill all available

00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:03,250
capacity how do you keep now this is the

00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:05,440
new norm and everyone's exhausted again

00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,809
how do you have you fight that that's a

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,850
great question um I didn't run into that

00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:11,710
I mean we really were able to just been

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,750
reaped the benefits you know because we

00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,399
were getting the work done there wasn't

00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:20,440
a bunch of other backlog work that we

00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:21,580
weren't getting done um and you know at

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,080
the end of the day though for me it was

00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,590
a way to justify the funding if they

00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,299
wanted more right first one was free you

00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,970
know so you know I got him hooked right

00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:31,960
you want more you gotta give me money

00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,240
because we got to do this with some real

00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,559
tools now I mean yeah this proves we can

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,929
do it I'm not really sure you want to

00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:40,629
run a fortune 100 company this way but

00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:42,129
you know it's doable and I know it's

00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:43,750
doable and lots of other people are

00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:45,340
doing it and now you two are doing it

00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,169
and like I said I could do the math on

00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,909
the engineering hours six million

00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:50,110
dollars give me six million dollars see

00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:51,639
what I can do with a budget this time

00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,169
right we're with no budget I did pretty

00:32:51,639 --> 00:33:01,049
good give me a budget you know I think I

00:32:53,169 --> 00:33:01,049
can kill it anyone else thanks so much

00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,500
you

00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,760
