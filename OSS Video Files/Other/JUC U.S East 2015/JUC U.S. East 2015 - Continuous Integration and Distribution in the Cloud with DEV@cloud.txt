	By: Mark Galpin, JFrog 

Correct this if it's wrong, but as a software developer you have two main dreams - to enjoy your coding and to not have to care about anything else but code. Setting up an environment and maintaining a CI/CD cycle for your software can be complicated and painful. The good news is, it doesn't have to be! In this talk, Mark will demo some of the most popular alternatives for a cloud-based development life cycle: from CI builds with DEV@cloud, through artifact deployment to a binary repository and finally, rolling out your release on a truly modern distribution platform.
