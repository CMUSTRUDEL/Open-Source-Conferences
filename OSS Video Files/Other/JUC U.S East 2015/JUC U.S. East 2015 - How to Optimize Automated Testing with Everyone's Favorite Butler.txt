If you are taking the quality of your software seriously, you have numerous automated tests across many different Jenkins jobs. But getting a grip on all of your automated tests -- and then figuring out whether your software is good enough to go live -- becomes harder and harder as you speed up the delivery of your software. In this session, Andrew will share tips on how naming conventions, partitioning of testware and mirroring the application's structure in the test code help you best handle automated testing with Jenkins. He will also provide insight into how to keep the setup manageable and will share practical experiences from managing a large portfolio of automated tests. Finally, Andrew will showcase several practices that help manage all of your results, plus add aggregation, trend analysis and qualification capabilities to your Jenkins setup. These practices will help you draw the right conclusions from your tests and deliver code faster, with the confidence that your systems won't fail in production.
