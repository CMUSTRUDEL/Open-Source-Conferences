Publication date: 2020-01-23
Playlist: JUC U.S East 2015
Description: 
	By: David Dang, Zenergy

This presentation will cover an actual use case of mobile automation to proactively drive mobile website and application testing activities. Topics covered include: 
- Using one script to test mobile and desktop websites 
- Ensuring smoke test execution as part of the continuous integration (CI) process 
- Providing timely reporting to make go/no-go decisions 

Solution: 
- Use the Perfecto Mobile plugin with Eclipse and Java 
- Leverage Perfecto Mobile cloud for mobile execution 
- Use Selenium WebDriver 
- Use TestNG and ReportNG 
- Integrate with Jenkins 

Results: 
- Execution time reduced by 80% 
- Coverage increased by 100% over manual testing
- Jenkins triggers automation of scripts across desktop browsers, including Firefox, IE, Safari and Chrome 
- Jenkins schedules regression execution

we start off by saying that this is the

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,520
first time I've use of our mountains but

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,050
usually they will give you put into size

00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,990
down I'm day today I were both public

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,090
calls energy technologies and so I'm

00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,980
going to start by saying you know I want

00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,780
this to be as interactive as possible so

00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,930
we have questions or anything stop you

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,730
time I do have to tell you have a

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,400
psychology degree so what that thing is

00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,260
you know we don't like your topic you

00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,920
can certainly help us psychology and how

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,570
crazy would all right you got to know

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,850
more about me that you're never here

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,900
just let the kettle all right a little

00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:02,540
bit back by myself um I style a long

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:04,820
time ago as made whole db2 CICS

00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,140
developer you guys most of you guys are

00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,409
way too young to even know what that is

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,920
right yeah you don't want to right and

00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:17,000
when we talk about running a job stop

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,010
running a job all right so I was in in a

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,030
lot making scroll and all that stuff and

00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:25,220
then I got into QA about long time ago

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,130
and I want to gauge myself that much and

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:31,130
now it daniel has before and then

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:34,520
nothing special free now how many people

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,860
know what this operation is I must look

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,670
good that's really good that's a pretty

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:43,250
good turnout of that ah for those of us

00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,490
really know integration assassination is

00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,730
riding home from has oh yeah I mean you

00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,200
know I tries to check my pearpad but

00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,330
basically they tell anyone else I work

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,580
with computer right because let me just

00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,740
a concept but if you know about this

00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,880
operation is nothing more than you know

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,659
y la selling in my macro that rustling

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,630
automatically we do yeah we can

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,720
itself all right oh I've been doing

00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,900
tests on me for ok I'm going to eat

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,450
yourself yes the last 17 years ok I'll

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,590
start out you know doing this operation

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,660
using commercial music right so for

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,019
those home automation you know

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,810
windrunner Kim DVD all of those you know

00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:31,660
one another in the last five years or so

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,829
the market have really had gone to put

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,739
the sauce right and about three years a

00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:40,989
lot of kids doing Jake individual right

00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:43,090
and i wanna the reason I think this not

00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:46,510
because I don't want to talk to you guys

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:49,239
about how we had 11 change so that we

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,660
can begin the most Patent Office of me

00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:56,079
all right and again anytime all

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,860
right I feel like a matrix is every time

00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:01,870
I want that they start right my face so

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,590
again in to give any questions

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,879
alright so wanna talk about we kind of

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,489
want to talk about a little bit about

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,600
the background of the project that i

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:17,319
just got off right why we select certain

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,989
tools to get this accomplished right and

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,230
then also what are some of the mining

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,989
aspect go into a tessellation project

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,840
and that the outcome and was right any

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,579
of acceptation in a Jacob conference you

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,630
gotta have a damn and he's going to be a

00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:39,639
ride and I don't run all right and then

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:42,700
it was anything like that alright so the

00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,760
first thing is asking our pocket is

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,079
really moving toward what we call

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,720
obviously for digital channel and then

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:52,090
he uses situation right so it it's

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,819
pretty funny because I actually like to

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,489
make see I conference as benefit he sure

00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:01,419
about six years ago and the conference

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:05,109
was opening little 30 people with Eddie

00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:07,700
and now it's like it'll you can't talk

00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:11,159
about continuous innovation man

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,349
genican or TV city or someone right

00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,650
because how many are moving on the

00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:18,959
direction also i'm paying applications

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,850
that companies are moving forward what

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,840
about digital channel because i heard

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:27,510
that term canon digital channel this is

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,720
basically doing things that are

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:37,949
basically evil wet days are long weeks

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:41,970
right how many microscope having used to

00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:45,900
have a platform of wow that's very good

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:48,360
because i just finished unfinished but a

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,360
few months ago I was had Star News which

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,160
is a huge queue involvement right and

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,060
every time I has that question is always

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,710
one a lot one person has to happen all

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,130
right but of a channel is

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:05,150
basically the memory right to build

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:08,400
something that are looking for wealth

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:13,560
okay like the best software and the mole

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:16,740
right how many people shop online right

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:22,099
now three years ago you go to your

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,099
laptop right but guess what most people

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,580
now last Christmas I did most of my

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,639
shopping with what happened and my phone

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,680
all right so I'm sitting at the airport

00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:38,370
Michael you know three more days till

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,039
the ocean a big so I'm my eyes right so

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:44,910
that's kind of what we get it needs more

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:51,050
work where the line between desktop okay

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:54,270
web application versus mole change ah

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,550
alright and really work right a lot of

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,820
company combine those into what we call

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,039
digital camera all right now think about

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,190
it right you also have to anywhere watch

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:09,000
and the mileage those are all considered

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,430
digital channel he says all right now

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,289
how do we keep up with them right

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,560
something about it let's say that you

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,260
built a web app

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,530
right in the past I've your web

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:24,610
application I have to test on firefox

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:27,580
from I you all right so we don't have

00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:33,130
been controlling a virgin right I mean I

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:37,090
lost 38 right 3735 snow same now if you

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,800
add that all right think about how t

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,740
mobile device you have the testaments

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,040
it's crazy right all that kind of

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:49,180
welcome to sew into digital chapter so

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,850
most company of their participation and

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,030
then on top of that company our voy a

00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:59,740
dar how many people how many people they

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:02,950
go together oh nice right it's you are

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:07,750
even doing a drive ourselves from the

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:10,600
top card spoken one on one ready all

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:14,710
right all you need to turn miniature one

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:18,100
I which is basically the one they call a

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,229
net file right now based on that right

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,470
background the whole concept is release

00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:26,919
every 22 creepy right behind some time

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:29,910
oh look how I can imagine add up over

00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:35,169
Testament there's a lot of challenges

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:38,770
okay I'm a little words of some of the

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:41,169
result so the governing our witness was

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,470
a huge issue income I can't actually the

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,930
name right because I sign this building

00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,150
by labelling right so like how you guys

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,710
I'm going to be a restaurant reservation

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:56,710
NFS right um they are increasing their

00:07:53,710 --> 00:08:00,940
digital channel when / where go right

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:03,900
they go hand guy right now a lot of

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,760
you still have a horrible address I want

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,920
again you know chew & Dragons

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,020
collaborations and all that stuff they

00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,300
still have a little bit of humor a

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,030
person's development right which is not

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,120
managed am I supposed to be collaterally

00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:22,090
right development you stinky I

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,540
that's why we ever okay thank you chuck

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:29,140
it all right into the bill through a

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:32,740
situation they want to elaborate

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:36,669
children's souls again come on really

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,890
the last four years ago okay you know

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,960
they want to be agile i want to use to

00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,810
the lightweight that you have licenses

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:49,860
and stuff like that and then we have

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:52,030
some pollinated hypnotist is

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,770
configuration management and stuff like

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,390
that okay how many people our

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:59,890
development okay how many people r QA

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,600
all right we have a good mix here so i

00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,030
can't catch talk back about any of those

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,980
group all right got it all right is we

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,210
can talk about about the business all

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:14,740
right yay Oh somebody's a business here

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:16,930
product owner all right so we you know

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,910
they'd have some unit level testing and

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,310
again in an agile world from a QA

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,080
perspective we always encourage company

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,960
to do unit level testing because again

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,270
the amount of changes that go through

00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,030
it's almost impossible to test

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,130
everything from a UI perspective you

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,220
have to test it from a unit level right

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,740
and again garner did a great great study

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,590
of many year back right if you can just

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,780
catch eighty percent of your defect in

00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,790
unit testing right you're going to have

00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,660
much cleaner coal when you get to QA

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:54,339
right and then you 80 and whatever else

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:57,670
all right what else what they want all

00:09:54,339 --> 00:10:01,120
right they want one automated script to

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,130
run across browser and desktop now the

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,160
only way this is going to work is the

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,960
website they create was responsive web

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,790
design does anybody know what responsive

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,190
web design is you guys heard of that

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:17,100
term right great okay in the past this

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:21,420
what happened if I go to like CNN com

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:24,000
right and I do it on my laptop it would

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,190
be of what we call a full site right but

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,380
I've I look it up on my phone and have a

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,420
little m in front of it to indicate

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,700
mobile right now the problem with that

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,940
is you still have to website you got to

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,550
maintain right now lately company have

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,680
moved to responsive web design right

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:44,660
isn't that a cool name responsive

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,430
unresponsive ok and all that mean is

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,430
they creating a site that is smart

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:53,550
enough to know what is this display

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:57,840
resolution and adapt to that to optimize

00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,820
the display the website all right now

00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,160
why is that important for my automation

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,000
standpoint because it's not two separate

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,340
website all the object level should be

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,740
the same make sense you guys know about

00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,380
object level right like for example ID

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,690
xpath all that fun stuff right they

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,090
should be the same now the only way we

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,280
can create one automated script for both

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,980
desktop browser and mobile browser is

00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,290
those object are the same if they're

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,960
different guess what it's going to be

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:31,490
very difficult to create one script to

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,650
work on both sides make sense all right

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:38,790
they want a subset of the automation

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:40,380
sweet to run as smoke tests okay as part

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:43,380
of continuous integration everybody know

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,570
what the term smoke test is I know you

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,760
know where that came from this is what

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,040
I've been told many many years ago okay

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,170
the term smoke test is back in the day

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:57,060
where you a computer is literally this

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:58,890
room with transistor right and so every

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,930
morning someone come in there and turn

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:03,750
on the power button and they look for

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:06,089
smoke all right what I mean by smoke is

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,370
above remember that we don't call it

00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:11,250
deep of defects right we call it a bug

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,960
right so a bug would get caught up in a

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,510
transistor right and when they turn on

00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,820
guess what zap all right and the little

00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,140
puff of smoke comes up right so they're

00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,940
looking for that puff of smoke and say

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,980
oh that transistor is bad because it got

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,750
shorted out and they go find it and then

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,850
pull it out and put a new one in right

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,720
and that's why the again I've been told

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,279
now I

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,490
in tow and many conference David you're

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,170
crazy that's urban legend okay the term

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,529
doesn't come from that but I like that

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,360
story so I'm telling it to you all right

00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:41,220
so anyway that's where the return bugs

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,990
and smoke tests coming smoke test is

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,600
nothing more than testing the core

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,850
functionality of your application right

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,009
so what is a core functionality of

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,069
application kick amazon you guys shop on

00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:54,420
amazon i hope so right amazon just

00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:57,269
happened to be the biggest retailer

00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,160
online retailer right so what would be a

00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:03,779
smoke test for you guys if you guys were

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:09,240
to test amazon can i log in that's kind

00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:13,050
of important right what else search for

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:18,060
a product what else that's huh add

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:20,189
things to your card actually the most

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,920
important test case is not logged in the

00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:26,310
most important is check out can I click

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,230
on buy it all right because where do you

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,360
make the money not when people doing

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,529
search right it's making money when of

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,059
course you have to be able to add to

00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,370
cart and all that stuff but at the end

00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:38,459
of the day how many time have you add to

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,439
cart and say change your mind okay and

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:42,779
that's why all this ecommerce company

00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:44,939
have this thing called one-button

00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:48,149
purchase all right the reason for that

00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:49,829
is impulse buying okay impulse buying is

00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:51,930
big all right and that's where the

00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,910
psychology comes in all right cuz like

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,069
you know I'm at an airport getting delay

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,290
right and I'm going looking through do

00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:00,720
news I'm like oh my god i really need

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,089
that back scratcher right because I'm

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,829
delay ok so I'm going to go out to that

00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:07,649
website and if they have a one-button

00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:09,240
purchase guess what it's purchase right

00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:11,579
there vive go through all this process

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,399
probably not going to be purchase make

00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,740
sense alright so they want smoke tests

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,930
all right now we're going to talk about

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,569
Jenkin and in just a second how that

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,910
click come into play all right they want

00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,220
timely reporting to make go or no-go

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,800
decision all right now this is very

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,290
important because again if a bill fell

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,059
we don't want it to continue right

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,309
because again the whole concept behind

00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:37,980
continuous integration is that I will

00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:40,740
find a problem at the time that I check

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,490
in my code if you know into always right

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,920
it would be

00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,470
every Thursday every other Thursday i'm

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,910
going to do a build right and developer

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,040
have already made all these changes and

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:53,370
when there's a failure we have to say is

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,589
the Jocasta failures might contest value

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,930
or is that Jane gains that call this

00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:00,300
value right it's harder but if I know

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:03,240
that I check in the coal it does a bill

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:07,110
it felt guess whose fault is it my fault

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,330
does that make sense all right ah they

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,339
want low maintenance for the automated

00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,050
script now as sweet now this is very

00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,970
important for those who know automation

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,370
the biggest factor that automation

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:20,190
failed is maintenance it's not

00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:23,040
developing the code ok I can develop

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,440
Nicole no rom but if every time I want

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,459
to run I have to somehow touch the coal

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,870
that's gonna be it's funny because

00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:32,880
automation is kind of like the magic

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,490
bullet right a lot of companies like who

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,339
i want test automation right I want test

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,380
automation right and then when I go look

00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,450
at it right I do a lot of automation

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,100
audit and then they like oh we have

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,540
automation and I'm like all right run it

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,190
and say they're like oh I can't run it

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,760
yet I got to go change this file I'll

00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,230
take this thing first and do this all

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,000
right then I can run it I'm like how

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,270
long does that take it takes a few hours

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,790
like there's not automation okay again

00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,560
if this manual intervention I'm not I

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,480
gotta say there's always going to be

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,820
some manual intervention but you want to

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,120
keep that as minimal as possible make

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,490
sense all right and then also here's a

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,370
big one how do I automate based on

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,500
dynamic content all right automation is

00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,230
really simple if you have what we call

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,690
static content all right if I go out

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,149
there and automate wikipedia i can

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,850
automate like nobody's business okay but

00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:30,600
you know if i go out there and try to

00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,459
automate the stock bolt right the stock

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,860
number it's going to change all the time

00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:37,050
right the object is going to change all

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,560
the time how do I automate that that's a

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:43,709
really difficult things to get past

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,110
makes sense all right so what did we do

00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:48,720
we know the background we know the

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,760
objective of the customer so we know

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,940
that they want to use open source so we

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,440
went out and get the alphabet soup okay

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,600
this is what I call the alphabet

00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,360
soon all right and what does this is

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,709
this is kind of the to set we selected

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:07,020
all right I'll we have a cliff with Java

00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:09,420
ok we have Jenkin which is why I'm here

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,380
we have pests ng report ng

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:16,380
selenium-webdriver svn perfecto mobile

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,730
may then we have all that stuff now we

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,439
need all this stuff and don't worry i

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,740
will describe to you what each of this

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:28,500
does alright but this is kind of what we

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:30,810
came up with alright so before we can

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,970
actually even implement all this stuff

00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:36,450
the first thing we have to look at is

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,530
how are we going to do this right we got

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,390
to look at the q a row and

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:42,540
responsibility now the reason for this

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,310
is most people in QA are not technical I

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,350
hate to say it all right most people in

00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,900
QA are not technical all right they

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,450
usually come from either the business

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,880
side okay so a lot of coming does this

00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,930
hey I need to test something and you're

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,640
in the business you know how the

00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,220
application should work come and help me

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,560
test and then when they built a QA team

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,440
guess what that business tester become a

00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,690
QA person all right all they come from

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,090
customer support or one of those teeth

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,730
right now the problem with that is when

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,170
you implement automation if you don't

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,300
have a technical background it's gonna

00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,520
beat all right because you're not gonna

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,250
be her to say hey create a loop for me

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,340
and a business person a loop what is the

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:26,610
loop right oh right in a raid array what

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,830
is an array alright so you gotta know

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,500
what you're building it for all right

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,480
and then also the type of testing you

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,950
are doing within a spring are you doing

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,960
unit level casting are you doing

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,990
functional are you doing integration the

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,630
reason for that is different to set have

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,090
different responsibilities so if I need

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,670
to do unit level automation and I have

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:50,850
java i would use Jane Union right I

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:52,620
wouldn't use selenium okay selenium is

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,380
more of a UI to write multiple

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,360
functional and integration testing all

00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,910
right then you have to know about test

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,100
environment all right now how many

00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,179
people here they're tested by me do they

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:08,370
only have one test environment or many

00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:09,090
many all right so most company have what

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,270
a

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,130
environment right a QA environment and a

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,860
minimum and then an integration

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:19,050
environment and then some time a staging

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,790
environment right now do we want our

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,640
automation to run in all those

00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:25,520
environment if the answer is yes I gotta

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,780
remember that when I built this thing

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,550
mix then because you don't want to

00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,380
afterwards say oh I want to run in

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,390
staging say oh we don't support staging

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,710
all right you got to give us all this up

00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,130
more money actually that's not a bad

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:40,010
idea anyway that's a consultant right

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:42,690
all right we want to know that all right

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,760
you also need to know a pest data

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,520
strategy what is a test data strategy

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,580
how many people here have applications

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,860
that basically can use the same data

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,820
over and over again all every time I do

00:19:52,860 --> 00:20:00,600
something have to do unique data unique

00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,390
data right same stuff you're very lucky

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,270
I would like to work for your company

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:08,580
all right usually data right it has to

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:11,970
be unique so for example right if you

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:14,130
have an itch aw application and i want

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,500
to add somebody to that HR software

00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,450
right it's probably going to be your

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,220
social security number but once I add

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,520
that person to the database if I try to

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,870
add it again hopefully right the system

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,090
that should be smart enough like whoa

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,720
that person already exists in the system

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:32,190
we can't add them make sense okay now if

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,330
the system doesn't have that you're

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,550
going to get to paycheck which is

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,470
awesome all right actually I have a

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,420
really funny story I know we don't have

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,570
much time I have a really funny story so

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,070
I was testing an e-commerce application

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,530
right and we're putting in all this

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,050
product okay like we're buying all this

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:54,150
stuff right someone forgot to turn off

00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:57,210
the feed to WMS live okay so we're

00:20:54,150 --> 00:21:00,480
putting all this order in right and then

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:03,480
luckily the supervisor and the way house

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,620
say well why is this why is this person

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,900
keep working the same thing you know 100

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,810
times right so luckily that person ho

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,640
off right and actually call back now

00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,080
think about if that person was like yeah

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,010
whatever i'm going to fulfill it the

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,170
order right think about real data a real

00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,010
product being shipped out so after that

00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,350
I change all

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,700
I automated script to go to my house all

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,070
right just in case it happened again

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,740
guess what I'm gonna get a lot of good

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,970
stuff okay but but that's that's the

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,010
kind of things you want to think about

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:38,910
right the things that you want to think

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:41,220
about as far as test data wise okay can

00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:45,210
I do I have to come up with an algorithm

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:48,000
to create data all the time ok and then

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,370
level of testing right you I back-end

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,950
database what am I testing here all

00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,350
right application technology now this is

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:58,740
important right because if you use open

00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,600
source okay most of the open source to

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,780
set will work great with web

00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,880
technologies okay it's somewhat work

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,070
with window technologies but it's

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,020
horrible working with packages

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,530
technology you know what i mean by

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:17,010
package SI p peoplesoft right ebusiness

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:18,810
we okay those packages there's not many

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:21,690
open-source to that work with it right

00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:24,030
so you need to make sure that defect

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,890
tracking right why you want to make sure

00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,590
you have an understanding defect

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:32,490
tracking is because remember automation

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,560
is an expense okay right I hate to say

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,840
it automation is a huge expense for most

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,580
company and if you don't justify your

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,800
existing you're going to be gone very

00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,630
quickly all right because if you come

00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,670
there and you say yeah I ran ten

00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,530
thousand tests and then somebody say how

00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,590
many defect have you found I don't know

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:52,440
we know we ran ten thousand tests okay

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:54,480
that will not help make sense all right

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,060
and then again coming back to QA

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,710
resource skill set all right all right

00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,230
those are all the stuff that you need to

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,380
consider all right so after we look at

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,960
all this factors here the next thing is

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,660
we designed this little thing here okay

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,540
and what it is is the execution is going

00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,340
to be managed by Jenkin right the test

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,250
grip is going to be run from test ng

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,260
we're using page object model have you

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,870
guys ever heard of that term page object

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,760
model yay okay page object model is

00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,890
nothing more than decomposing your

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,290
application into pages and what you can

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,780
do within that pages all right and you

00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,810
built the test by putting them the

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,659
pieces back together make sense all

00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:38,609
right we're going to we use report ng

00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:41,159
and then we run it across desktop and

00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:44,849
mobile okay and then we use selenium

00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:47,399
webdriver with maven and svn now we use

00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:50,009
selenium here now selenium actually

00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:53,789
offer many many different language okay

00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:57,809
it offered support for java boss right c

00:23:53,789 --> 00:24:00,989
sharp okay it offers support for HP HP

00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:03,179
somewhat okay python okay now the

00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:06,450
problem with this is this when an open

00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:08,330
sore to open source to set you want to

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,099
select one with the biggest community

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,720
all right and java just happened to be

00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,849
the biggest community out there now the

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,999
reason for that is let's say that i need

00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:19,590
to establish a connection to a database

00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:21,749
somebody probably have a sample code

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,099
that you can cut and paste i truly

00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:24,720
believe in cutting and pasting just to

00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,820
let you guys know right I don't like

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,249
reinventing the wheel right now if you

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,710
are doing it in PHP you might have to

00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:33,690
write the code okay which can be very

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,669
time consuming so from a selenium

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,279
standpoint we always like to use either

00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:41,789
Java or C sharp because those to have

00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:44,159
the biggest community makes sense all

00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:49,259
right and then from an execution

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:53,340
standpoint okay we execute it okay using

00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:56,099
vm through either the browser okay we

00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:59,609
are using selenium grid okay to do that

00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:02,789
execution and then also we are executing

00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:04,950
it through the mobile okay Mobile Safari

00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:07,919
browser and all that fun stuff any

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:12,749
question you guys seems bored all right

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:15,690
I think yep yep so so open source why so

00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:18,899
right now right right now firefox 38

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,820
came out selenium doesn't run on it it

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:23,849
takes a while for the community to catch

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,440
up however its support usually one

00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:28,019
version back and it usually think about

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,059
a month or two before the community have

00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:32,220
that support for the new one not only

00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:34,499
that to be honest with you selenium it's

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,869
great with firefox but like would I e

00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:40,379
with the number of security patches it's

00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:43,169
a little bit about them too okay oh yeah

00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:45,389
chrome chrome is on there okay well I

00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:48,479
this I will show you what we actually

00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:50,290
run on okay yeah we have chrome this is

00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:52,210
just an example of the vm that we have

00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:54,790
set up to run against it for my a

00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:58,840
selenium brixton on on the on the mobile

00:25:54,790 --> 00:26:01,270
side um yeah I'm a QA guy right and when

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,190
you talk to you QA people and you say

00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,920
I'm gonna test it on an emulator or

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:08,140
simulator we're like no we don't like

00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,210
that right the reason for that is it's

00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,250
not what the user is going to do and a

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,470
lot of the simulator emulator doesn't

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:17,140
have the same hardware configuration

00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,480
that will give you a true test mix then

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:23,590
so we always like to run it against real

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,030
device okay good question all right are

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,460
you guys okay you guys bored because I

00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:32,370
can I can deviate into the psychology

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:36,400
part of it all right all right so

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:38,620
question ah so selenium webdriver right

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,410
what is what is selenium web how many

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:44,950
people have heard of selenium webdriver

00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:46,660
yay how many people use it yay so I

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,050
don't have to go into too much detail on

00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,700
this right so selenium webdriver it what

00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:54,640
it does is it interact with browser

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,530
objects okay again it worked with both

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,720
desktop browser and mobile browser and

00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,610
it lets you navigate saying all that

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,310
stuff right it have all these packages

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,530
of your working java to do that also

00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:07,840
selenium is really good with supporting

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,750
in Ruby too ok so if you're a ruby

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,170
developer is pretty cool too I work on a

00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:18,670
few I work on project that use Java a

00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:21,070
lot Ruby and see shop and PR PHP PHP is

00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:25,660
the toughest one ok if you want to use

00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:29,470
selenium webdriver with PHP okay all

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:32,500
right now jenkin that's why we're here

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,690
right we use Jenkin all right and we use

00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,760
Jenkin to manage the build process for

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:40,210
the automation run all right we also

00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:42,070
have we set up jobs within Jenkins let's

00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:44,410
say this is a regression test this is a

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,690
smoke test so we set up all this

00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:50,860
different type of pests inside there

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:53,560
okay and we set up a prerequisite I post

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,600
bill activity that every time co is

00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,030
checking after is being built the post

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,310
bill activity is to run the smoke test

00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:02,560
remember I told you about the 20 smoke

00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,989
tests that we run all right it's a post

00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,329
bail activity for us

00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:09,519
then so if the bill is successful and

00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:12,039
the smoke test is successful then the

00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,589
bill is good right if the bill fail we

00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:16,209
don't even run the smoke test okay if

00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:18,369
the bill is successful we run the smoke

00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:19,929
test the smoke that spell then we're

00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:23,709
going to do analysis to see if it's

00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:26,019
still a go or no go make sense so again

00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:29,049
what we did is we use the developer

00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:31,299
Jenkin okay drinkin instant and we just

00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:33,459
add our stuff to it all right it's

00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:35,559
really cool actually now unfortunately I

00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:38,769
can't show you the client itself but I

00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:42,159
show you a demo in a just a second all

00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:44,709
right ah we also use it for on-demand

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,079
execution right so a lot of time if we

00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:49,029
have failure right we just use it and

00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:50,619
say kick off this bill and then what it

00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:52,719
does is it reacts acute a lot of the

00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:54,699
test all right it helped us maintain

00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:57,249
field history and we put now this is

00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:59,379
really important because again in QA you

00:28:57,249 --> 00:29:02,709
will always be asked hey you said it

00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:04,149
pass right three bills ago but the

00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:05,889
defect we found it through but what

00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:10,379
happened right we want to keep that

00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:12,879
history okay and also it let us arm

00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:15,159
integrate with the existing of

00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:17,619
continuous integration process all right

00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:20,679
so basically we use it for this we use

00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:23,049
it for scheduled execution so we

00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:24,879
actually set up a scheduled execution

00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:27,459
that it doesn't matter if there's any

00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:30,159
change or not right once a day we will

00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:33,249
run what we call partial regression okay

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,719
and then we have the trigger execution

00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:37,209
which is any time developer checking

00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:39,429
co-run the smoke test and then we have

00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:41,499
what we call the on demand right so

00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:43,479
usually like you know how after the

00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:45,159
sprint everything everybody combined a

00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:48,129
code will run what we call full

00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,559
regression on demand okay all right what

00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:53,169
else we have we have test ng how many

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,809
people have heard of Tess energy all

00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:58,779
right awesome pass ng basically it helps

00:29:55,809 --> 00:30:01,569
you manage test flow okay it facilitate

00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:03,069
a test setup and teardown and it also

00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:05,469
groupid you can group it in different

00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:07,389
suite the biggest thing that like when

00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:09,399
you use selenium you can use j unit to

00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:12,729
run it too okay the biggest difference

00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:15,359
between j unit and pass ng test ng allow

00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:18,429
you to run in parallel which is a big

00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:20,499
big advantage right because I

00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:22,929
want to run it single-threaded right I

00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:25,600
don't want to have 300 tests running

00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:29,830
only on IE right when i ii finished kick

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,799
off a Firefox I wanted to say hey if you

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:34,480
have the resources running an IE running

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,490
firefox running this run on this round

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:42,700
this and the demo i would i'm going to

00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:44,559
show you that make sense it's so

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,299
selenium it's just it's kind of you

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,090
think of selenium is the engine that

00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:51,669
interact with the object from a browser

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:55,419
okay Tess ng doesn't do that Tessa entry

00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:57,610
manage the test that selenium create you

00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:59,740
see what I'm saying so I can say Tess ng

00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,570
go run me this test Tessa energy go run

00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,149
me this test test and it's more like a

00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,830
test management aspect when you do

00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:08,139
performance testing you're talking about

00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,899
hundreds and hundreds of virtual users

00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:12,490
right even with Tess ng you don't want

00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:14,889
to increase the thread count to more

00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:18,429
than 20 30 unless you have a super

00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:20,529
computer with 100 vm right so some

00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:22,799
company actually use source laughs have

00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:26,590
you guys ever heard of sauce lab or

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,749
amazon elastic computing okay what it

00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,970
does is it built virtual machine for you

00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:32,619
and you sent the test up there it runs

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,869
it and then it download the result for

00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:37,330
you right in that case you might be able

00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:38,860
to do some performance tests but usually

00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:41,139
in a performance testing we use what we

00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,809
call virtual user right we just sent the

00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:46,539
protocol IP call right and then get it

00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:48,700
back you see them saying so I would not

00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:51,490
classify this performance however you

00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,649
can do what we call standard service

00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:56,110
level agreement what I mean by that is

00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:57,820
if you have a website right and and a

00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:00,029
business come to you and say login

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,919
shouldn't pick no longer than 10 seconds

00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:04,649
ok so I'm going to put the timeout in my

00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,320
script to be 10 seconds for lock in

00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:10,330
right if it takes 11 second i want the

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,360
script to fail you see what I'm saying

00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:15,279
now because I haven't meet my service

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,799
level agreement from it doesn't matter

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,570
this one user or a thousand user right

00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:22,600
if it's more than 10 second I should

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:25,210
fail make sense so I can do what we call

00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,100
ad hoc performance testing but not true

00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,080
you know to performance testing is no

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,450
one is on a system I sent 10 virtual

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,639
user here's my result

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,320
a hundred virtual user here's my result

00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:38,200
you see what I'm saying I can correlate

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,659
the data right but if i run automation I

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,940
can write I don't know this 80 manual

00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:46,559
tester banging the system and then i

00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:51,490
added a few more and blow up make sense

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:53,559
ok that's a good question all right page

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,889
object model what is page object model

00:32:53,559 --> 00:33:00,730
all it does is basically we we divide or

00:32:56,889 --> 00:33:03,309
we huh we break down the application

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:06,370
into pages so if it's amazon i have a

00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:08,740
search page right i have the product

00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:12,370
detail page right i have the navigation

00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:14,919
page i have the whatever page right the

00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:17,440
add to cart page all right and then what

00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:19,570
you do is inside that pay you tell what

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,669
that page can do right so this login

00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:24,269
page i can type in username password

00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:27,309
okay i can type in the wrong username

00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:29,080
right the right password you see what

00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:31,809
I'm saying I put the combination of what

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,720
I can test inside that page class all

00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:37,470
right all the methods have in it okay

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,760
and it gives you the variation

00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:42,580
difference in practice between mobile

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,730
and automation so it gives you the

00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:51,880
ability to do that now I didn't mention

00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:53,679
this but go ahead single page

00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,269
application but everything gets

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,519
dynamically generate in that single page

00:33:55,269 --> 00:34:00,820
then i would still break it down on a

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,370
page but more of the dynamic page right

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,769
so even though it's the dynamic page it

00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:08,740
still have page name right it's going to

00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:10,810
traverse make sense it's still going to

00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:13,569
be a page object page object motto is a

00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:15,310
really simple concept right but it gives

00:34:13,569 --> 00:34:16,960
you that reusability cuz think about it

00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,089
right when you test how many time you

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,790
log in every test to get to certain

00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:24,909
place right why do you want to go up

00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:26,710
that 434 line in every test you code it

00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:30,970
at one time you just call that class and

00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:33,970
method makes sense okay it gained a lot

00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:36,010
of reusability from it all right now

00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:39,369
what is spring spring is a free

00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:41,020
framework it's really cool because what

00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:43,270
you realize this remember I told you

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,100
about responsive web design you guys

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,410
remember that okay we spot

00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,270
webdesign say that hey the web page

00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:52,510
should be the same right on desktop and

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:54,640
mobile reality is it's not always a

00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,980
hundred percent the same now what I mean

00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:00,010
by that is on desktop you have much more

00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:02,200
space right I'm a much bigger canvas so

00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,660
like for example the top navigation it

00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,730
display on mobile you will see the three

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:09,700
line you have to click on that three

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:11,890
line to display the menu item okay so

00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,810
this difference is now how do we account

00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:16,300
for those differences we actually use

00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:19,150
the syncros sprint okay sprint will let

00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,160
us lo different page object dynamically

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,690
so if I'm running on mobile i'm going to

00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,240
pick low a different page to do

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:28,750
navigation then I would do it on desktop

00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,120
browser makes sense okay so this is

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,190
actually a really cool framework that

00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:41,230
you can download again oh this is kind

00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:43,390
of free alright for responsive web

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,730
design the navigation does change but

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:48,280
most other stuff is actually pretty good

00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,620
at the like for example when you talk

00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,960
about the the detail information usually

00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,060
for mobile and desktop is similar and

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,120
also if you work on tablet and that's

00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:00,220
how there's very little differences okay

00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,860
the biggest difference is you're smart

00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:05,380
mobile device right like your phone okay

00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:07,540
not only that it vary between phone and

00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:10,990
phone all right yeah I mean you guys

00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:13,750
seen the iphone 6 plus right it's almost

00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,910
a tablet now okay so that display is

00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:20,740
also different between a six and A six

00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:24,310
sr6 plus all right we put ng it let us

00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:25,960
report okay and it's color-coded and

00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,550
it's all that fun stuff it's from a

00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,470
reporting standpoint this is really

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,910
important because again you got to know

00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:34,840
what password fail and stuff like that

00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:36,850
um for this project we use report ng the

00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,960
demo I'm going to show you oh my god all

00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,730
right the demo I'm going to show you

00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,830
it's gonna we're going to use a package

00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:43,750
called law and it's it have a little bit

00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,460
nicer right so there's a lot of

00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:50,380
reporting framework that you can

00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:53,020
integrate okay and then we also use

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,240
perfecto all right and the reason we use

00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,970
perfecto is well they have a proof right

00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,050
outside our room that's one right the

00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,960
other reason is

00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:04,690
it is real device okay and that's really

00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,780
important from a testing perspective we

00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:10,420
are testing real device okay now they

00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:16,300
are cloud-based so the device to minute

00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:18,700
that's it you're kidding me oh my god

00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,990
