	By: Kostas Gaitanos, FINRA

At FINRA, our CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise-based ecosystem supports over 100 applications, with hundreds of folders, thousands of jobs and corresponding build pipeline views. The need to effectively manage this ecosystem became obvious rather quickly. This talk is about some of the issues we've encountered and how by implementing a list of plugins, i.e. Folders, Role-Based Access Control, Folder Templates, Jenkins Build Pipeline and Job DSL - among others - we were able to reduce the overall effort of creating and managing the Jenkins-based ecosystem by 70-80%.
