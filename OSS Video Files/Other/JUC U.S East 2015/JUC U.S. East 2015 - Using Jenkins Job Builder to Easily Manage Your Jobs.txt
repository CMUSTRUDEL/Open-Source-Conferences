Is there an easier way to managing Jenkins jobs than via the UI, XML files, API? There IS a simpler solution; you can use Jenkins Job Builder (OpenStack upstream project). Jenkins Job Builder offers the following: 
- Simple descriptions of Jenkins jobs in YAML format
- Job descriptions kept in human readable text format 
- Kept in a version control system to make changes and auditing easier 
- Flexible template system, so creating many similarly configured jobs is easy (avoids duplication).
