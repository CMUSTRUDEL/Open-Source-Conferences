Have you ever completed a build and wondered what exactly changed? Typically, output logs and parameterized build input data such as SCM branches, bug tracking issues and notes entered by the developer are lost once the build has completed. At best, Jenkins keeps this information for a limited time. The only historical reference is, perhaps, in a report. Consequently, this data cannot easily be reused for future builds or reviewed during the auditing process. Using Jenkins, Groovy and Neo4j, this data can persist for the life of a project. This presentation will describe the simple steps taken to save this information for posterity.
