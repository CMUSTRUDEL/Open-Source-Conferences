	By: Martin Hobson, Agilex Technologies 

Agilex is building a medical data portal application that aggregates data from many sources. As part of the continuous integration process, the Agilex team has set up a complete environment with actual implementation VMs of the different data sources. A total of 12 or more VMs must be launched, per build. Once launched, the team then deploys the portal and runs acceptance tests. The provisioning process is complicated by the need to observe specific startup dependencies, and overall performance is slow. The amount of output generated by the VM startup process is large and challenging to analyze. In order to review the startup performance and identify options for improvements, the provisioning and test process was instrumented and the startup timeline was graphed for review. This allowed the team to verify that dependencies between the VMs are observed and showed opportunities for optimizations to reduce the build times.
