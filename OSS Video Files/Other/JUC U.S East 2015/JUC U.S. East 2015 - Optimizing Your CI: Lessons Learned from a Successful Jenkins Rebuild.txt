	By: Jonathann Zenou, Ravello Systems 

Ravello Systems has relied heavily on Jenkins since the early days. During the company's first four years, their Jenkins setup changed and evolved to the point that it was out of control. Ravello decided to take all the experience from those years and create a new and improved Jenkins setup. This session will share the lessons that were learned the hard way - and explain how the CI process was optimized. The process of re-doing the CI mechanism for a large, always developing group will be discussed, as well as mechanisms for revision control in Jenkins, job infrastructure and architecture guidelines for maximal flexibility and various other considerations. The overall continuous integration and testing strategies - which are completely cloud-based and cover all our varied components (from a hypervisor through networking and storage layers, distributed backend systems and all the way to an HTML5-based UI and a cross platform client side application) - will be described.
