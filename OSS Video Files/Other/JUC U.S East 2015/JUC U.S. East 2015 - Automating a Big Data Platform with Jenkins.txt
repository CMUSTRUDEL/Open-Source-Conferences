	By: Sander Kieft, Sanoma 

Sanoma is the largest publisher in The Netherlands and Finland, running some of the largest websites and mobile applications in those regions. Since 2010, Sanoma has been using Hadoop to process big data and gain insights into their products, customers and advertisers. After using traditional ETL tools for data ingestion and process management, Sanoma moved to Jenkins in 2012 to automate the big data infrastructure. This presentation is about the past, present and future of the Sanoma Data Platform and the role Jenkins plays within it. Attendees will get a brief introduction of the challenges involved with big data and the way they have been tackled at Sanoma. Sander will also touch on the pains and joys he and his team get from Jenkins.
