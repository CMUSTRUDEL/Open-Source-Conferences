[Applause]

00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,880
[Music]

00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,230
[Applause]

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,160
[Music]

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:17,190
[Applause]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,170
all right it is my honor and privilege

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,420
to be here I'm so thankful that I came

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,340
all the way from Germany to see this

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,160
beautiful mountainous city and I have to

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,990
tell you it is beautiful since we're at

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,550
the last talk I have a favor to ask you

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,230
and that is now that you've seen

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,210
everything now that you've experienced

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,430
the conference if you were particularly

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,320
moved by something if some if there was

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,239
a good talk or maybe you're just really

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,060
happy with the volunteers we should go

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,710
tell them I encourage you to do that

00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,809
because a little bit of encouragement it

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,050
was a really long way so to show that

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,000
appreciation as mentioned my name is

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,280
tages that's pronounced like every

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,220
syllable after the first in the word

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,420
contagious

00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,850
just a little mnemonic for you because

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,010
it is an exotic name and I for some

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,700
reason my tick does not want to connect

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,460
let me try that again

00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,990
perfect and I live and work in Berlin

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,670
Germany at this company called Cohn

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,110
Tiamo

00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,759
what we do is data science and AI and

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,860
all these cool things but I have to tell

00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,780
you the reason I'm there and I'm happy

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,009
is because of these incredible people I

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,289
work with some of the greatest people in

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,490
the world and they mean a lot to me in

00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:22,999
fact they're the reason I'm able to come

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,219
here and enjoy the city with all of you

00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:27,960
today we're here to talk about a tale of

00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,630
two architectures as was mentioned and

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,479
particularly in the arena of mobile apps

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,639
with JavaScript we'll talk about native

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,359
applications built with react native but

00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:40,249
really the concepts apply to other j/s

00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,409
style

00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:44,670
native bridges and progressive web apps

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,549
and we kind of look at the trade-offs

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,139
between both and see maybe what might be

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,450
the right tool for you or your team to

00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:54,149
use in case you decided to explore this

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,729
area of mobile web applications but let

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,429
me start by saying we make apps to solve

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,200
problems that that's the primary

00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:03,539
motivator for apps right like it's some

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,479
people make apps for fun like there's

00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:08,789
like a pizza finder and things there's

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,899
just like a extra sketch which we might

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,420
think well this is kind of meaningless

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,370
no it's actually meaning full whimsy on

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,280
the Internet is meaningful just fun apps

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:20,040
are meaningful because they help us

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,200
deflate they help us express a sense of

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,080
wonder that we saw from even Sara's talk

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,000
earlier but also we create apps like

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,500
Twitter that help us express our

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,720
selves and communicate we create apps

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,110
like tinder that help us you know meet

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,490
someone new apps primarily solve

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,610
problems I'm here today to tell you

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:42,750
about an app that I built for myself to

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:45,300
solve a very specific problem to me and

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,010
then I did build this with react native

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,720
to kind of get into that it was just a

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,910
learning project but also I thought

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,860
about how would this work as a PWA and

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,810
there were some things I learned that

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,280
I'd like to discuss with you today but

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,940
first let's talk about the problem that

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,170
I set out to solve I have a sickness I

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,080
have a bleeding disorder it's called

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,200
haemophilia and what it means is that

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,080
once I start to bleed I do not stop

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,140
until I lose all of my blood and then

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,209
die and I tell you that because it gets

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,620
better believe me the the solution in

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,750
this case isn't just not to get cut

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,080
because little known fact we as human

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,910
beings bleed all the time like your body

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,470
is covered with these tiny little blood

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,840
vessels right that when you when you

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,209
throw a ball or when you climb stairs if

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,519
you carry your backpack like you start

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,890
to bleed but you stop before you even

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,840
notice whereas for me these things

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,690
literally carrying a backpack have put

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,630
me in the emergency room that's kind of

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,570
a problem right now there is medication

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,760
but it's expensive and this is actually

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,150
the reason I will not live in the United

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,100
States

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,170
I cannot live here because of the

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,820
healthcare so that's actually why I live

00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,410
in Germany because it's free for me and

00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,690
I'm able to live I'm able to travel I'm

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:04,350
able to really thrive more than just

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,540
survive so I have free medicine I have a

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,790
good life everything's great but the

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,100
medicine doesn't last long so I have to

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,040
top up it has something called half-life

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,739
and the half-life is 8 hours so assuming

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,500
I take 100% of this medicine 8 hours

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:23,790
later it's 50% 8 hours after that it's

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,330
12 sorry 25 and it's 12.5 6.25 on and on

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,669
it goes

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,190
effectively if I don't top up after a

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,440
certain amount of time it could be very

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,850
bad for me and so well that okay that's

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,860
that's definitely a very specific

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,880
problem hemophilia effect it's like 1 in

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,530
20,000 people and so I do the only thing

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,480
I know I'm not a doctor

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,520
I have no interest in biology if I'm

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,960
being completely honest with you but I

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,850
do have interest in JavaScript so my

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,430
solution was well let's build an app but

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,530
if I don't if I don't cure it I might

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:57,510
help it right and I'd like to show that

00:04:52,530 --> 00:05:00,420
to you today it's really nothing special

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:03,060
at all let's pull up my simulator and

00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,220
you'll see that all right so this app

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,670
very simple it's just a little donut

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,470
chart that shows me a little graph a

00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,030
data visualization and it shows me an

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,980
estimation of the amount of this

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,810
medicine that I have in my system right

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,360
now I don't have sensors anything in my

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,340
body it's it's just a basic logarithmic

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,160
formula when when I take my medicine I

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,330
tell it and then it does math and at any

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,710
given time will tell me how I'm doing

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,140
and this for me is the difference

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,910
between do I take a bicycle back home or

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,190
do I get an uber because one of them

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,130
will do more damage than the other and

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,940
so for usability I I just click this

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,630
infuse button

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,530
I tell it how much medicine I took and

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,240
you know what let's go ahead and do this

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,430
so I'll delete the false positive later

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,740
I do this and if the internet works

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,960
there it fills up and you can actually

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,300
watch it decrement in real time so this

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,979
thing is really really meaningful for me

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,110
and so what I'd like to do is walk you

00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:59,310
through the code of it and talk about

00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,710
some trade-offs between this implemented

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,340
using native web platform features and

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:07,100
using like react native or some bridge

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,870
to do that let's look right at the code

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,479
my screen resolution changed which is

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:15,360
nice we have more space let's go ahead

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,919
and make this real wide and pull up the

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,110
index j s and if you all used react in

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,780
this room just so I can okay all of you

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,890
more or less so react natives very

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,729
similar if you haven't played with it

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,010
JSX

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,870
right this file you get for free it's

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,479
effectively react Dom render but native

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,580
and if we go into app this is where we

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,740
see the beginnings of my app it uses

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,970
Apollo in graph QL that's the purpose

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,950
that's not the purpose of this talk

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,330
although it's really cool and I want to

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,860
actually shout out the Apollo team

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,260
they're doing incredible work and they

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,430
make my app possible this view here

00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,580
you're looking at and the simulator is

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,340
called right now and if we look at the

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,830
declarative UI it's well it's quite

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,480
declared

00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,100
you have a container you have a pike

00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,560
container that contains my little pie

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,930
chart and you have some table rows that

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:06,430
map directly here to the metadata that I

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:09,640
see you have a log shot button where on

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,020
press I toggle the form and of course if

00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,210
the form is visible then show the form

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,900
so that's essentially this this behavior

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:19,960
right here this app though has a UX

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,150
problem that really really bothers me

00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,960
and when I'm sick and I'm not in the

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:28,180
mood to deal with awful UX I need to fix

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,070
it now let me show it to you so if I say

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,500
for example my usual dosage is 2,000

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,820
units if for some reason I take more or

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,860
less and I want to change this I tap

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,020
here and I bring off this keyboard but

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,660
like it it obscures my view of

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,430
everything else and it's it's unpleasant

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,960
because now I've lost my context what do

00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,540
I do

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,280
if we look at the code for this I'm

00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,000
importing a view from react native and

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,970
I'm using glamorous which is a CSS and

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,540
J's library to style my container so

00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,520
really it's just it's a view that that

00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,830
contains a keyboard so I want to make a

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,360
way for this little view to avoid the

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:09,010
keyboard well how do I do that

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,650
I know there's a search website on the

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:16,450
internet so let's go

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:18,160
keyboard avoid react native look at that

00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,720
there's a keyboard avoiding view that

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:26,680
I've previously been to but pretend it's

00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:29,080
blue and okay so we have this keyboard

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,240
avoiding view can you all see this sure

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,630
and this is I think more or less what I

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,190
want

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,700
I'm obviously seeing this for the first

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,260
time and so okay well what does it look

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,810
like well I guess I just imported this

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,510
thing from react native and use it let's

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:47,400
try so I have my editor I was gonna

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:49,480
import keyboard avoid

00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,940
one of these days I'll learn to type

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,670
keyboard avoiding view and if I

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,710
understand correctly I just need to swap

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,760
out in my view for a keyboard avoiding

00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,860
view oops

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:06,730
I'm using react vs code and then reload

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,030
my little thing if the internet yes and

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:13,570
now it should

00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:18,230
oh my good enough crap doesn't work okay

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:21,730
I don't believe in the demo gods you're

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,840
saying anyway so now there's there's uh

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,890
well there's some problem there's it

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,820
enabled prop

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,100
maybe that's what maybe I just haven't

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,410
enabled it let's go enable it Shirley

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,980
Shirley that's the thing so let's go

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:36,410
here enabled alright this is gonna work

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,940
y'all I believe it I feel it I feel it

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:43,820
in my developer bones infuse come on oh

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:46,150
man what an look okay what other I'm

00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,730
really like I'm losing time guys um

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,570
keyboard vertical offset well I don't

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,360
know that's not what I want

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,890
behavior oh it's this Android and iOS

00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,920
both interact with this prop differently

00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:03,650
hmm little bit smelly Android may behave

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:10,600
better when given no behavior prop at

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:12,890
all whereas iOS is the opposite okay

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,810
let's just pretend that didn't have my

00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,220
content container style no that's not

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,560
what I want and then there's a neighbor

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,560
there's really nothing here that can do

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,550
okay well let's maybe go look at the

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,930
let's look at this what do we have we

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,040
have style I don't need this so using

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,080
glamorous and we have this behavior

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,580
thing

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,570
well whatever man copy paste driven

00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,860
development that's behavior equals what

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,750
do we got height all right let's try

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,589
this I've no idea what that even means

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:43,900
like what is hype all right let's see

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:46,520
so infuse oh my goodness it disappeared

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:52,190
like the opposite happened of what I

00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:53,480
wanted why don't you do this and now

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,080
it's still visible

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,970
it's okay well that's kind of weird

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,980
let's try something else I don't at this

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:11,589
point you know what like its many

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:11,589
padding these names all right

00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:18,470
you know and now I don't lose my context

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:20,300
I see things this now I am a happy user

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,330
of this a part how long did that take

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,100
how was that easy that was not easy it

00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,660
was misleading it was confusing and this

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,860
is part of it I'm not saying react

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,420
native is misleading I'm not saying

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,790
react natives bad it's very very good

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,110
and the team has done a great job some

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,279
of them are friends of mine it's very

00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,200
good they've actually taken a lot of

00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,029
measures to accommodate touch events and

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,339
so on it's really sophisticated but

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:42,350
there are some things that are not

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:44,990
obvious now let's look at implementing

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,140
this keyboard avoidance using native web

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,990
platform features

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,670
let's open up while my browser and we

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,320
have pretend there's a like data

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,640
visualization there the point of this is

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,660
not to you know put a patch on the

00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,839
screen but to show you keyboard

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:04,160
avoidance with a web browser so I click

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:09,640
in here okay well it just works if we

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:13,190
look at the code we have two files

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:15,589
index.html which is just this and a

00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,770
style sheet that makes the button read

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:20,180
and so the web platform for free will

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,520
just give you these behaviors why

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,250
because it's it's known it's it's it's

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,580
like a living standard so to speak and

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,760
so in some cases using the web platform

00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,020
may be easier than using react native

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,120
and so that was just a little demo I

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,740
hope I hope it was it showed you kind of

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,740
some other trade-offs but we'll talk

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,140
more about those now so when setting out

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,310
to build an app there's a ton of

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,980
different technologies I could use right

00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,779
I could use Kotla and I could Swift has

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,640
this amazing new declarative UI that's

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:50,779
kind of like react but and swift there's

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,880
a lot of different things I could use

00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,650
but for me as a JavaScript as a web

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,870
developer I think I'm gonna stick to my

00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,000
guns and I was gonna use JavaScript and

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,880
this is not just me here's a here's a

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,720
data point for you sixty six point seven

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,640
percent of all developers ever use

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,380
javascript in some capacity or the other

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,570
according to stackoverflow.com I think

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,010
that is a very impressive number and so

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,279
naturally I'm gonna implement my app

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:18,320
with JavaScript then the question

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,900
becomes all right I've got JavaScript do

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,640
I do it native so it runs lower level on

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,420
the device or do I do it as a

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,750
progressive

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,340
that which one do I choose and why

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:32,060
that's what we'll talk to so progressive

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,010
Web Apps what are they they're Web Apps

00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,890
standard Web Apps react view whatever

00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:40,730
you want web apps that progress into

00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,540
being an app on a device through magic

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,970
I'm just kidding

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,680
through through something through using

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,670
service workers through working offline

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,380
through providing like manage like icons

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,540
that actually render on a home screen

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,880
that essentially it's a web app that

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,800
works offline that you can save to your

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,110
home screen and it behaves and looks

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,220
like a native app but it's not this is a

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,050
progressive web app and it's a

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,440
simplification I know but that's the

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:08,330
best I can do web apps are incredible

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,670
their money makers they just they

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,320
somehow seemed to be this Midas touch to

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,650
business value of most companies and

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,080
projects in fact tinder load times from

00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:20,000
eleven point nine one seconds to four

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,660
point six nine seconds with their new

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,940
PWA

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,450
and when moving from an Android app to a

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,480
PWA it's 90 percent smaller ninety

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,920
percent smaller that is very very

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,750
impressive and of course when you have

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,140
something small fast and accessible

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,660
engagement goes up second case study

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,700
uber right boobers PWA was designed to

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,910
be fast even on 2g and let me tell you

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,920
this is somewhere I would give a

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,930
humungous round of applause to Ober for

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,390
making their thing accessible yes maybe

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,070
it's motivated by profit sure but

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,550
there's a significant portion of the

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,680
world

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,180
that does not have the fast internet

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,010
that we have here that could benefit

00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,090
from these services and by making it

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,450
accessible uber is doing some really

00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:05,060
great things the core app is 50 kilobits

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,580
or kilobytes G's it and takes less than

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:11,540
three seconds on 2g networks because of

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:14,030
PW a final case study Pinterest rebuilt

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:18,320
their mobile site as a PWA and they saw

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:20,990
engagement increased 60% that yeah who

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,870
said that that absolutely that is really

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,340
really impressive also users generated

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,230
more content and people spent more time

00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,680
on the site because PW A's are

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:33,020
comfortable to use and and fast and they

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,660
work offline and they they're just

00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,770
little miracles I strongly believe in

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,089
the value of pita

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,860
if you want to learn more about

00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:43,160
progressive web apps I highly recommend

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,620
following Maximiliano firt on twitter he

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,880
is like the source of all things PWA in

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,880
terms of information and I highly

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,500
recommend him also he's very vocal about

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,040
Apple not being nice and I think that's

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,750
cool I guess but in terms of

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,390
architecture this is an architecture

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,760
talk in terms of architecture PWA s are

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,480
simple you write JavaScript you bundle

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,300
it ship it they any place with a browser

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,370
could run a PWA in fact with new ES

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,470
modules and their support in browsers

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,170
you could get rid of the bundler just

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,459
write JavaScript shippin especially

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,959
would like pica that we saw earlier

00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:23,149
today that was so impressive but while

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,850
you're easy to create they're a little

00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,529
bit hard to create right

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,290
this is the PWA checklist from google

00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:34,700
and this is not the full list there's a

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:36,230
lot that goes into making pwh google has

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,120
done a really good job of categorizing

00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,890
in terms of priority so this stuff you

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,540
absolutely have to have like TLS

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,950
encryption this stuff you kind of have

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,339
to have this stuff you could overlook

00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:48,829
but for me as an engineer I want to do

00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,420
my best and check all the boxes and if

00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:53,870
you want to do that for a PWA that's

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:57,800
quite hard but let's stop trade-offs

00:16:53,870 --> 00:17:01,160
good stuff PWA is work on all devices

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,220
for free and they're really a single

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,319
codebase for everything they give you a

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,850
universal experience meaning you write

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,800
it once you shape it everywhere and

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,890
since it's one code base it looks and

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,990
feels the same as a web developer you

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:20,300
use the tools you know and love

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:22,790
JavaScript web pack you have access to

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,240
web api is as well so things like the

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:28,459
web speech API things like the fetch API

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,230
you know these and so you can use them

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,330
and build your progressive web app it's

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,390
quite comfortable and lastly you can use

00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,910
device features when they're available

00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:42,140
so the w3c is actually doing some work

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:44,179
to extend the web platform quite a bit

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,280
giving you access to sensors on devices

00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:48,500
so they published this document early

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,240
this year in April and it outlines a

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,780
bunch of new API is that are

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,260
to you AP is for and the sensors and

00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:00,200
things that said there are some

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,270
downsides to PWA s mainly they're a

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,940
little bit harder to monetize on market

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,960
and this is debatable but I would say

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,559
this is kind of where I land on this

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,300
because yes you can do SEO on SEM but

00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:13,520
you don't really get to put in all of

00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,010
the app stores now Google is doing some

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,620
work to add pwace to the Play Store and

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,510
this is amazing but as far as I know

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,850
we'll still doesn't have PW A's in the

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:25,370
iOS App Store which is a significant

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,990
means of distribution and that makes PW

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,490
is a little bit hard although if you

00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,100
have an excellent SEO team I guess

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,350
that's fine you have limited access to

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,270
device api's so for example if I wanted

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,950
to set up an app if I want to create a

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,530
progressive web app where I could set up

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,660
a geofence a little zone on the map that

00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,010
when I step into it do something when I

00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,900
step out of it do something else like

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,610
turn on the lights at home I can't do

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:52,280
that with pwace maybe yet the UI and UX

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,800
can be inconsistent because some vendors

00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,050
don't allow you to customize things as

00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,590
much as you'd like so for example the

00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,480
iOS PWA is often like you don't get to

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,890
customize the area around the knotch at

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,780
least I couldn't as much as I wanted to

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,000
I could set it to like white or black

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,710
but I couldn't really do much in that

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,809
area and so that's something new users

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,240
will notice you're going to be working

00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:15,350
with browsers and so sometimes you're

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,120
gonna be working with the Samsung

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,950
browser Chrome

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,000
the Samsung browser on marshmallow

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:25,040
KitKat jellybean it's it's it's a little

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,750
bit hard to get right and of course I'd

00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,540
put security down as a negative point

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,809
because as secure as your PW is it

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:36,020
served over TLS but as secure as it is

00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:38,179
it will never be the security of being

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,340
on the device with no connection to the

00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:43,010
outside world right from my medical app

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,380
I want my data my medical data to maybe

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,630
live and die on this device and that's

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,740
something I can't do with a PWA let's

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,800
switch context a little bit and talk

00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,840
about and react native how does react

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,750
native look how does it work how does it

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,040
compare to the other ways of doing it

00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,559
before we get into that react native has

00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,710
seen adoption by a number of big players

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,200
we're talking Skype uber

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,299
one drive Amazon Prime MIDI and this is

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,570
outside the usual suspects of messenger

00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:12,250
Instagram and all these and in terms of

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,289
architecture it's a little bit more

00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,059
involved so you write JavaScript but

00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:17,559
it's not early JavaScript it's a JSX

00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:19,750
so it's not native web platform

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:22,149
javascript and it use it and react

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,129
native is a layer that well will bind

00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:26,049
your JavaScript to the system underneath

00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:27,970
right so react native allows you to

00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:30,279
express your functionality in JavaScript

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,259
and then you then then essentially runs

00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:34,389
it on the device it's all packaged

00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:35,740
together with the Metro bundler which is

00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:38,740
kind of a web pack of the react native

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,149
world and it outputs different binaries

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,730
for different platforms so you get an

00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:44,590
iOS app you get a Android app and other

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,389
platforms what's missing here

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:50,620
unfortunately is there's no output

00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:53,350
target for the web platform and so you

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,570
could land up in some weird like my

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,129
native app supports these things my web

00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,629
app supports these things in fact I've

00:20:57,129 --> 00:21:00,419
seen this I think in the Twitter app

00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:02,620
where there's this thing called moments

00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:05,110
and I tried to use the moment to I

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,429
either on web or on native and it was

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,470
like sorry you need to go use it on this

00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:10,120
other thing if I try it on native it was

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,190
like you need to go on web it was on one

00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,990
of the other and so you can have some

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,419
inconsistent UI because the web isn't a

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,850
compiled target there is work being done

00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:20,710
in this space there are two libraries on

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,750
one called react native web and the

00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,690
other called react native Dom react

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,309
native web is quite cool because with

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,529
react native you have these components

00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:31,960
that are conceptually equivalent to

00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:34,029
component two like HTML elements the

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,039
view component with react native is

00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:37,570
conceptually equivalent to a div some

00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:39,519
would say the text element is

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,710
conceptually equivalent to like a span

00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,559
and so what react native web will do is

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,690
at Build time swap out your references

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,519
to react native and will import those

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,909
same components from react native web

00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,289
which are just react web components it's

00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:55,389
quite cool and it allows you to interact

00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:59,529
with the web platform really well react

00:21:55,389 --> 00:22:02,110
native Dom is another extremely

00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:04,809
experimental just a marvel of

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:07,269
engineering because what it does is it

00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:10,299
takes a react native app and runs it in

00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:12,970
the browser more or less this includes

00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:15,990
the layout engine of react native which

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:19,270
is an implementation of flexbox

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,280
implemented in C++ so it does layout on

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,780
a separate thread in a web worker

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,940
because this thing is compiled to like

00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,170
web assembly right and so on the web

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,720
right now you really can't animate

00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:31,300
layout without triggering reflows and

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,470
its performance heavy you can kind of do

00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,360
this with react native Dom and it's

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,000
really fun to play with but it is highly

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,280
experimental to put it simply react

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,470
native web is web first react native Dom

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,600
is native first and I tell you that

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,330
because that changes this diagram and

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,760
adds a compile target to where now you

00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:51,100
write react native and it can go

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,050
everywhere and this for me is quite

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,620
significant so with react native prose

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:59,110
you write react once and you can deploy

00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,310
everywhere you can easily monetize and

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,250
distribute because you can get your app

00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:06,280
in the iOS store the Play Store all the

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,740
stores you have more ready access to

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,080
native API s so I can do the geofencing

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,630
thing and this is important I can share

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,880
state with the with the native OS so I

00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,040
can for my medical app for example I can

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,570
integrate with health kit with react

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,890
native wear I can't do this with a PW

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,080
and this for me is really important

00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,880
because I want health get to have my

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,490
bleeding data so that it can interface

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,650
with other apps too and lastly since it

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:33,430
compiles to web now I could even just do

00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,840
a PW a with react native the cons well

00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,040
you have different api's for different

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,350
devices as we saw in the beginning like

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:42,490
this keyboard avoidance thing it works

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:45,160
on Android it doesn't work on iOS Y so

00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,750
it is realized I may die you see how

00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:52,000
little hair I have it's because I tore

00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:55,660
it out of seemingly trivial tasks like

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,030
keyboard avoidance I'm I need some time

00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,620
to recover from that one and you of

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,780
course you require androids to you and

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,910
Xcode these things are XD they're heavy

00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,500
apps and quite frankly I have a really

00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:09,040
hard time with Xcode because it just it

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,450
it hugs my resources and lastly wiring

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,710
up your dependencies can be hard and

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,230
what I mean by this is like you have to

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:16,420
deal with like Xcode like provisioning

00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:21,100
certificates and things like this which

00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,390
for me as a web developer why thankfully

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,190
there's work being done even in this

00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,950
space so there's a thing called Expo

00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,480
that seeks to streamline and improve the

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,640
developer experience around the

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,910
native world effectively what Expo does

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,850
is removes these two negatives and gives

00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,350
you like you so much as scan a QR code

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,660
and you start a react native app and you

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,490
can run it on the device expo is is

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:46,059
really cool and so that makes the list

00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:48,549
of pros and cons that looks pretty good

00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:50,230
and this is why I chose react native for

00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:52,450
my app mainly because of the Interop

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:56,710
with health kit and the ability to just

00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:59,080
get a PWA for free but again you compare

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:01,179
architectures and I mean that difference

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,900
is is significant one one of them

00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:07,990
involves j/s maybe a web pack the other

00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,530
one has a lot more different tools stuff

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,730
around it so the question in the room is

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,720
when is this over another question in

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,500
the from the skinny the question is

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,150
which one should I use and the answer is

00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,549
your classic answer it's it's the answer

00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:25,570
to life the universe and everything out

00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:28,840
42 it's the other one the answer is it

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:30,790
depends right like it depends on what

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,200
your use case is it depends on what you

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,610
need so for me I need to share state

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,919
with health care for me I need to do all

00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:38,080
these things so for me it's clear for

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,400
you I have no idea my goal is not to

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,470
tell you to use one over the other my

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,030
goal is to lay out the pros and cons the

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,730
trade-offs and have you make the

00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:48,610
decision but I must remind you that as

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,650
we said in the beginning we make apps to

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,390
solve problems and it's all about

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,490
balancing your trade-offs what do I get

00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:57,880
if I use this versus what do I get if I

00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:01,299
use that but ultimately at the end of

00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,900
the day look around you

00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:08,830
right there's we're here as web

00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,179
developers but it's it's the people that

00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,580
matter and so I don't think there's

00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,809
gonna be people using my app I don't

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,850
think there's gonna be bleeders like

00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,559
sick people using my app thinking does

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,799
he split his code with web pack or

00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:23,530
parcel I don't think people care we we

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,900
make apps for humans to solve problems

00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:28,660
and so I encourage you do not let that

00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,299
slow you down but solve the problems

00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,280
solve them fast solve them well and

00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:36,210
solve them for humans hey thank you so

00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,210
much for having me

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:46,580
do you wanna if you were in a situation

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:48,860
where you had to it sounds like if you

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,020
weren't you had a debate between PW A's

00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:54,320
and native apps you'd probably want to

00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:58,850
be on the PWA side is that right or no

00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,820
it depends I depends uh-huh I mean I in

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:04,730
my case I for my my health app I really

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,980
I see more benefit in building on device

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,330
so with some type of native binding

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,550
layer like react native or I think

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,870
there's native script to even a reason

00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,430
ml I think compiles to native and the

00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,500
reason for that is because I just have

00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:19,190
more control and more access to the

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:22,460
system underneath which I need mm-hmm

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:25,490
so deep so what do you think that

00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:28,370
there's so such less support for PW A's

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,410
right now it's a good question I don't

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:34,520
know I don't know if there is less

00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:36,410
support for PW A's I mean well you were

00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,600
talking about some of the tooling that's

00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:41,480
kind of hard to deal with and like some

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,100
some issues with like you know how

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,320
things render if I if I remember

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,360
correctly know okay so maybe I was

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:55,570
thinking of something else okay all

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:57,950
right so okay so could you explain or

00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:00,980
maybe debate with yourself a little bit

00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:04,370
here say you had to debate on either

00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:07,490
side just give me maybe just stick a the

00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:10,100
thirty second debate on for both sides

00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:12,260
yeah so if I was to do a PW a I would I

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,930
would want something like I would use it

00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,930
for like marketing things or things that

00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:20,180
I want people to have immediately easy

00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:22,970
access to where they don't mind data

00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,970
kind of leaking to the cloud and living

00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,470
there if I want to also have it you know

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,450
kinda destroyed JavaScript and not worry

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,670
about distribution targets or platforms

00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,520
necessarily platform by platforms I mean

00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,770
os's instead of the one true web

00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,910
platform whereas with native as I

00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,790
mentioned already I would I would think

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:43,850
about okay do I want to keep my data

00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:46,850
safe on the device in that case I would

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,110
100% choose native because you can

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,690
create apps that don't commute

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:53,450
the Internet at all so I would do that

00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,679
also I would think about do I need what

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,320
kind of behavior do you want want do I

00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,980
want to interact heavily with the local

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,510
like gyroscope or the motion sensors

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,780
which you can do via the web platform

00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,530
but maybe you shouldn't because you have

00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,360
direct access

00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:11,660
so ultimately for me it's all about

00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:14,900
access and control how low do I want to

00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:17,450
go mm-hmm I'm just looking checking

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:23,570
questions here see if there's any more

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:26,840
here so so what do you enjoy I guess

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:30,919
working with with most that's a really

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:35,120
good question I enjoy working with react

00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:37,540
native significantly because to me it's

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,770
kind of just like writing a react web

00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,620
it's one thing that I know and I'm

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:45,860
comfortable with versus like with pwace

00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,220
I have to think about like Service

00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,400
Worker

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,740
I have to debug Service Worker which for

00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,480
me in my past experience was was quite

00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,590
hard because they start like two of them

00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,620
start at the same time and they fight

00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,820
and like it's a little bit messy but at

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,100
least it was it may have gotten better

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,710
but react native like I know it I

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,840
trusted it works so mm-hmm

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,910
so in terms of all right have you ever

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,780
come across issues in terms of browser

00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:15,169
compatibility with pwace and mobile yeah

00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:17,720
in the past not anymore now but like

00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:19,250
service worker was I think it was one of

00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,669
those things that everybody was waiting

00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,470
for it to get ready but it wasn't and

00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:26,299
and support for it I think now is

00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,299
universal and good and everybody is

00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:31,100
using it but I remember years ago when I

00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:34,610
was trying to do things with it and even

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,650
build pwace it was always like not

00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:41,919
supported in all the places I wanted it

00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:44,600
to be so yeah okay all right um I guess

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:48,020
let me just double-check questions here

00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:54,110
before I let you go here I know we want

00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:56,510
to definitely have our after-party here

00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:59,860
so let me just share it sorry not here

00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,860
here like walking

00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:09,150
see trying to think of a good good

00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:12,930
ending question what question actually

00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:16,050
do you have a question or maybe an idea

00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:20,760
of like the things that you want to see

00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:22,740
in pwace in the next year yes there's

00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,880
one person it's not necessarily the PWS

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,580
but there's one thing that I would just

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,480
like to see in this problem space and

00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:33,390
that is I would love to see Apple extend

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,100
first-class support for PWS in the iOS

00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,830
App Store like this thing for me would

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,770
be a game-changer all right thank you

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,180
thank you so much hate us

00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:55,479
[Applause]
