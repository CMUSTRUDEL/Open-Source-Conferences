Title: Kod.io 2014 - Spaxels - Ars Electronica Quadcopter Swarm by Chris Bruckmayr
Publication date: 2020-01-24

Description: 
	The Spaxels, the 3d-Pixels that the Ars Electronica Futurelab has created based on quadcopter-technology, have proven their skills to paint logos and animations into the sky a number of times.
The idea is both simpel and powerful: In order to create more complex 3d-forms than you usually could with the limited amount of Spaxels, you use a so-called Real Time Lightning Paint Video System.

The human eye can only perceive lightsources, but can't really track their light-trail, something that cameras can do.

They are set up for long-exposure-shots and through this, you can create complex 3d-models out of nowhere, using the Spaxels, cameras and screens.

my name is Chris Bookman part of that

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,350
specs electronica quadcopters one team

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,690
that's a lot even if it just says pixels

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,760
it's absolutely meaningless so it's an

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,980
ARS electronica quadcopters warm that

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,140
means that we fly as warm of quad

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,290
copters with a single flight control

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,900
system we have developed I'm mainly

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,580
concerned with the business management

00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,940
and the project management of the

00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,409
product so I'm always on site for shows

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,800
and stuff like that but there might be

00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:57,210
some technical questions I can't answer

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,339
but then there might be trade secret

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,729
anyhow so we will see how far you go

00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:04,739
okay I'm little fighting with the drone

00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,830
because it should do some light

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,070
animation but at the moment it's not

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,130
communicating so maybe it works it all

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,070
away a little afterwards I in general

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:21,479
this what you see here is a recent show

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:24,300
we did in Sweden in email that's the

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,930
European hard to capital of Sweden this

00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:30,930
year and this was the first time we flew

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:35,400
in winter conditions this we've had

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:39,140
minus 10 degrees and snowfall and worked

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:43,020
on a frozen lake and really surprisingly

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,640
it worked it was just always with this

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,820
kind of contracts you say yeah it's

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,580
going to be fine but you never know but

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,310
we could manage to fly are these adverse

00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,780
conditions and it was really very

00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,180
successful and this is practically the

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,980
you mere logo the logo of the European

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,330
culture capital this is in so far very

00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,890
interesting because our drone

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,740
manufacturer said that it might be

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,269
tricky to fly with minus 10 degrees

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,970
because of the batteries because the

00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:15,090
most important issue with drone flying

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,480
is the batteries their their lifespan is

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,670
pretty limited so if you fly for 10

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,440
minutes it's it's okay but everything

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,030
else then that is going to be tricky and

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,030
depends very much in the wind and the

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,920
condition so in this case we flew five

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,020
minutes and during our flight we

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,670
realized we could go longer so this

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,640
means that next time when we go to the

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:39,870
ant octaves we can probably fly even

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,270
longer this is the whole the whole specs

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,600
system I don't know how I where

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:50,040
everybody is of that system but the idea

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:54,180
behind that your own flying system is

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,480
that we decided that we might need a new

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,550
kind of visual display in this guy

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,100
that's that's really transformative that

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:05,730
is not just flat it's not two DS on it

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:08,490
just uses the open air space in a city

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,700
that we're always talking about rubbin

00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:15,420
interventions in public airspace in a

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,280
city and the idea was to turn to

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,070
generate flying pixels and then the

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,580
discussion boards how do we get them up

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:26,310
there the flying pixels and after

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,250
discussions about bumblebees there were

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,280
other things we we came up with the idea

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,620
to use quadcopters and what you see here

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,480
is is a scene from Sweden where we have

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,300
that fleet of quadcoptersted checking

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,230
their LED system and the trick with the

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:46,640
specs is that we get quadcopters from

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,590
ascending technologies in Germany and we

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,600
customize them with our own LED system

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,950
that interfaces with their processors

00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:00,450
and design our own animations in their

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:02,700
own we have our own procedure how to do

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,550
the show design on a 3d program and

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,000
transferred to our simulator software to

00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:11,790
turn it into gps waypoints but this is

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,730
the original state of the flag control

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,320
software I didn't program it and they

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,180
always had a hard time with it because

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,459
we probably can see why this might be

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,620
complicated because there's a lot of

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,380
information going on here and this is

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,260
practically all the drones here and all

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,440
the other stuff that's anyhow hard to it

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:35,750
gives us stuff back like battery status

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:39,419
communication frequency waypoints

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,180
problems and for instance the problems

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,810
were pretty hard to see on this

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:49,850
simulator what you see is there is a

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:52,490
from from linds we we usually use a

00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:55,310
satellite image for the 3d program and

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,610
start to animate that your owns the way

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,320
we want them and turn it into the flight

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,910
flight simulator software and the flight

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,910
simulator software takes practically

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,220
COLLADA file from the 3d program and

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:09,290
aims to turn it into gps waypoints and

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,780
there's the next issue because GPS is

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:16,700
not very precise so we always have to

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:18,050
figure in inaccuracies and this makes

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,600
the whole thing very interesting and

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,870
always very stretchy when we fly

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,669
somewhere we then decided to we did a

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,750
future with this Joseph this for

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:31,940
instance the the biggest show at the

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,320
SoundCloud the clan work event in links

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:39,650
where we flew 49 in public and 50 at the

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,690
rehearsal and then we used it for that

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,040
paramount show in London I don't know

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,050
where everybody has heard about this

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,810
where we hit did start work logo next to

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,340
the top which and after that people were

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,669
approaching us if they could license

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,410
that software and we decided we hire

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:57,020
somebody who's really good at this and

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,910
found somebody this is not very usual

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,789
and then we turn it into something like

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,860
this and now it looks totally different

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:08,060
even I can manage it it's practically

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:10,310
what you see here is a long way to go

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,880
this is these are all the informations

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,289
about one single drone so you can work

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,880
with every kind of thing it only gives

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,460
you back the battery status their

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
communication the update rate of the

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,539
communication and stuff like that and

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,729
you can handle all of these drones

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:29,270
there's a they have to describe the

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:32,210
process a little bit usually we we go

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,460
somewhere and do a so-called wakey this

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,169
is a GPS check at the location because

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,460
it's never clear if we can fly because

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:41,810
we're based on gps and when we do the

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,910
trick here show you a video afterwards

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,060
from the United Emirates where we

00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:49,100
recently did a wiki we decide how far we

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,930
have to space them because they're for

00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,590
certain starting and landing grid and

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,539
how how I way in this guy each of one

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,969
should be from the other because the

00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:01,219
point is they are not dead

00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:03,469
they don't know where the other one is

00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:05,839
they have no self conscience they've

00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:07,789
constantly feed us back with information

00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,039
about what they are doing but they're

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:12,469
not aware of it off their neighbor so

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:15,369
that's why we need a very tricky system

00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:20,599
to figure in possible collisions and

00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:23,329
stuff like that this is this is how we

00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,499
do it in the 3d program it took us a

00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:26,179
while to figure this out and that's

00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:30,289
practically two people in the future if

00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:33,529
you can't do this they design the show

00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,119
design on 3d mix they export it as a

00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,219
colada file and we have a way to

00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:39,619
integrate it in our flight control

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:42,709
system and I will show a little video

00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:45,409
how this how this works this is a scene

00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:48,789
from that plan work event when we flew

00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:48,789
the what an ankle copters

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,240
so we were using it satellite images of

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,610
reference there's a zero the so-called

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,160
IDC oh is that your own that is the

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,020
reference for all other drones so in the

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,220
simulation we start with positioning for

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:27,289
the zero drone and then reverend's all

00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,880
other drones to the zero drone this is

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:31,490
very important in the end because when

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,400
we export this to two hour flight

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,950
control software it's done the same way

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,930
we really have to fix a position for the

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,459
zero drone in the air field and then

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,720
everything else is practically based on

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:48,770
it that's usually not that easy because

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,310
if we take a satellite image from from

00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,690
google they're not very reliable so we

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,089
always have to go there a few weeks

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,820
before the show and check out if the

00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:04,220
satellite image is accurate if not we

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:05,540
have to a chance to show on site I think

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,000
there might be a lot of questions about

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:16,600
this later but I just go with you

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,600
through this whole thing we are

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,500
so this is a this is a picture for my

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,470
recent trip with it to the United

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,570
Emirates so we managed to put off like

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,780
consoles off the on a vacuum wacom

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,990
tablet and we just go there with a

00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,840
single drone have all the data here like

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:39,140
the GPS started a signal there's

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,240
satellites available how big the update

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:45,380
rate is we are coming in communicating

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,750
on 2.4 gigahertz that's very group but

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,240
sometimes with wife ever not so good but

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,250
usually we can manage this and we just

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,840
go to with this is a this is the

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,330
so-called crypt this is how we would

00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,540
spaced it the copters in the end and we

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,910
go there and fly a single drone directly

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,500
at this stage this is an mp3 were going

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,440
to fly we just go to check all the

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,450
cheapest record everything check out how

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,380
high we should go check out the viewing

00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:15,200
angle define the airfield and take all

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,090
take back all the data with really exact

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,890
GPS positions because in this case for

00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,260
instance they made their Island smaller

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,910
because they worked on it for a while

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,980
and then suddenly was a little smaller

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,810
so that would mean that our airfield is

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,100
not here anymore it might be here and

00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,090
then they sometimes put obstacles

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:34,130
someday somewhere then we have to

00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,690
rearrange everything and this is this is

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,340
the way we do it and I show you a short

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,340
video what a wacky looks like

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:53,029
so it is practically a pixel space pixel

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,790
we fly this is somewhere you might see

00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:57,769
somewhere around dubai and we just we

00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,390
just flight with our with our flight

00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,010
control software so there's no remote

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,470
control involved or something it's just

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,050
the tablet and the communication

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,800
equipment layout modem and we just which

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,750
is the flat around record everything

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,899
take the data home and then turn it into

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,480
a show and take like the plant usually

00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:19,610
is not a way of about of these

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,050
complications Amanda just say okay we

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,970
have a big show and we want to do this

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:28,010
and can you please fly us and we have to

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,959
start the negotiation then for instance

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,120
this is going to be our airfield then

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,640
then they put stuff like that in and we

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,050
don't want it and I don't know if it's

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,089
still there when they come back in a few

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:41,779
weeks and stuff like that and this is a

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:43,490
really lengthy process and if the gps in

00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:44,870
that area is not good and then were

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,279
anywhere in trouble because then we

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,769
might have to negotiate and that

00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:51,380
different airfield but this seems to

00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:53,060
work in this case and then when we come

00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,360
back for doing the show we come back

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:58,519
with further drones or something maybe

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,140
more in the future and then the whole

00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,360
thing starts again we have to position

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,649
them check the GPS for all of the drones

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,940
in the airfield are they communicating

00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:09,410
and starting test flying that and that's

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,170
the moment usually when the client gets

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,320
very interested because then they

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,820
finally see what we're talking about and

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,500
it's the same thing for you I'm just

00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:23,810
talking about it but it's way cooler to

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:26,959
see it because on video it's just a to C

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:29,959
to D thing and it's not really awesome

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,640
but I i was in my opinion because i'm

00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,459
always the eyes way more cooler to be

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,640
there but i show you actual sequence

00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:40,160
afterwards so fewer things we've done so

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,420
it didn't might get an understanding so

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,820
this is the table that we was talking

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,370
about with for now we always had to take

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,079
a big laptop there a really a big beast

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,970
and now we manage to do this on the

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,250
wacom tablet i don't know if any

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,470
designers here but now it's really cool

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,640
with yourself one drone and and that

00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:02,079
wacom tablet and DM tamer this is the

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,079
communication equipment for Iraqi

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:10,309
looks cooler afterwards but at this

00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:12,199
stage it's like this so this is a scene

00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:14,209
from from Sweden where I can see how

00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,009
they are filled is built it's like

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:17,779
really starting this is the troll number

00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:19,699
forever we start with the drone number

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,919
zero and then we space them out and

00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,949
every drone has a certain ID so the flag

00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,629
control can reference it and talk to it

00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:29,199
this is very important if we mix up the

00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:33,350
IDS then the flight control software

00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:35,569
talks to the wrong drone and did the led

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,009
led animation in itself that I would

00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:38,539
like to show you but I don't know if

00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:43,069
it's going to work otherwise it's a

00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:46,279
video is is preloaded on the drones we

00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:50,119
in the beginning we we broadcasted the

00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:52,160
gps waypoints and the LED animation but

00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:54,169
this was really clocking up the 2.4

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,049
gigahertz channel so we decided to

00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:59,239
preload it that means that we need a

00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:00,799
certain show elemental very fixed with

00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:03,829
the music and everything and then we can

00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:09,169
design the animation and pre loaded it

00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:11,869
and it looks roughly like this if we do

00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:23,509
an LED sequence then we practically

00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:25,279
export the file like this it's not very

00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:27,379
spectacular but you can see that it's

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,289
just practically just instructions how

00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:34,399
to switch on and off the LEDs and we

00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:37,039
have RGB values we can use any values we

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,389
want and because this thing at the

00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:45,829
moment is not working i show you what it

00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:48,499
looks like there is a big LED system

00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:50,689
down here this is something we add added

00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:52,609
to the quadcopters just without that

00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,949
it's practically naked it's just we did

00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:58,069
the top cover and here the LEDs if I

00:14:54,949 --> 00:15:00,669
switch it on you see it it's pretty late

00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,669
good morning

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,339
imagine we plant ourselves every time

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,470
with this but this is this is awesome

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,029
because because in the night you really

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,800
see it even there's no more complaints

00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:15,839
about how can I see the Syndicates

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,139
five-way blah blah no you can see it

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,940
definitely for for a few miles even as

00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:23,430
there's a certain drawback because it

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,699
needs power and with quadcopters

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:29,070
everything is about payload and power

00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:32,399
but we worked we really fight for every

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:34,709
gram and now we really managed to get

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,480
get this done if anyone anybody wants to

00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:39,560
hold it it's pretty pretty heavy with

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,589
the pedo is already but it flies very

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,120
good and so this is just a lengthy

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:46,589
process we're still working out you're

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,480
over thinking about what can we would

00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:51,029
use for could be gone and stuff like

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,980
that and we without your own partner

00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,300
they they're watching us very closely

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,010
and they always i think they are always

00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:01,949
amazed we were trying next again okay

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,079
there we are so what do you see here is

00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:05,639
that I'm sorry if it's not so much about

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,079
programming but I told you I'm not a

00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,319
program and I'm telling you the whole

00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,420
system how it works okay what what's

00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:15,120
very this is our communication equipment

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,860
these antennas the placing of the

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,589
sentence is extremely important they

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,720
should face north and should hit these

00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:23,790
these quadcopters show you where the

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,490
antenna is somewhere from this side if

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,949
we if we don't don't get that best

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,089
antenna if we don't get that right we

00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:32,130
have a really common i have a

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:35,970
communication problem and these things

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:38,970
move really fast there around usually to

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,069
2 meter per second but we started speed

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,069
testing now because we got bored and

00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:46,500
it's now 6 meter something we can go in

00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:48,630
that super fast because the point we

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,000
have is this we we start them in groups

00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:53,370
i think i have a picture somewhere about

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,010
this year as use we start them in groups

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,779
that have different colors and what this

00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,250
this is very important to us because we

00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,500
can start them in groups and then the

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,990
important thing happens in the air we

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:08,400
have to regroup them and take them into

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:10,400
an animation start position and that

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,709
takes a while and that takes battery and

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,610
then from there we have to fly over the

00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,500
air where they want

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,780
show and then we start practically the

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:23,339
show and that's why we recently started

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:25,260
to fly faster and if anybody is going to

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,420
see it in the future maybe at the

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,429
festival it's going to be faster it's

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,540
going to be very interesting I'm really

00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:35,160
excited about so this is another scene

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,710
from you Mia where you can see that you

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,480
even with heavy wind you can really play

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,080
some pretty cool man this is it not

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,970
correct because they are there there's a

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,980
spatial experience it's not add to the

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:51,690
experience like on the picture so and to

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,100
show up I'm sorry because it doesn't

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,919
seem to work to show you what they're

00:17:53,100 --> 00:18:00,540
really doing a short short sequence of

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:05,820
the last festival where we the first

00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:07,950
time use that new LED system and this

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,830
gives you a really good impression what

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:18,419
is artistically possible with this 550

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:20,340
ok I can't remember that's worth this

00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,350
was at the ars electronica opening it to

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,900
the back foot week where we flew from oh

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,630
this is nice too something for you yeah

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:30,210
wait that is this is with a quadcopter

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:34,890
done a quadcopter in this warm filming

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:37,290
this one from above I think that's right

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,820
beautiful a valid a quality of the GoPro

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:43,500
is not paid superb well in the future

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:45,120
might be also i think this is

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,650
soonerlater forbidden because they

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,260
haven't you to own law so i don't know

00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,510
if they're going to allow this but ok

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,750
and what I wanted to show is that that

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:58,320
we what we are often asked is to sync

00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,600
the projection or the video mapping or

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,820
whatever they do on the on on the stage

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,190
with the quadcopters and here we tried

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,919
some lip-syncing the video is slightly

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,110
out of sync but it should show you what

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:14,250
I mean what how fast you can trigger

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:17,630
these dead LED system I know it has

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:22,400
anybody been to that festival opening

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,400
only their usual the usual suspects

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:30,670
I think you should still here somewhere

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,500
yeah this is this was the special

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,350
request mother was a huge projection and

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,570
then we practically faked it the

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:44,100
particulates that go up there end up in

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:44,100
the quadcopters and then it should start

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:57,130
yeah that's the point that then we start

00:19:51,670 --> 00:20:00,550
to interact with it so this is my

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:03,340
favorite thing to do with drones because

00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,860
it's just basically beautiful and

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:14,740
everybody likes it even very important

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:16,900
people will like it and there's no we

00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,780
artists you never know but we are

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:23,470
important people like it and so this

00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:25,180
this is just this priesthood we if we

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,530
want to do this via communication it

00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,630
wouldn't work that's why we switch to

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,280
priest during the animation so the

00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,530
toilet that means in the end that we

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,800
have we are working time code based in

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:38,650
an inertial and really have to get it

00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,840
right somehow we did it so far we've

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,430
walkie-talkies but we're working on an

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,380
integration of the time code system

00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:50,860
media-based time code system in the

00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:52,270
software itself yeah I hope a little

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:57,970
world because there's some cool guy who

00:20:52,270 --> 00:21:00,490
you might like that so I go back I he

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,470
will come again because this is this is

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,590
mr. an heard from the entrances and I

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:13,480
button if anybody knows him maybe you're

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:20,350
too young there was a blast work with

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:22,120
him really enjoyable so you know this

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,710
was last year's edition we are not quite

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:28,380
sure what we're going to do this year

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,380
but let's see

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,030
okay I don't know if you know that stunt

00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:45,970
we do it's just it was the famous

00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:49,600
pyrmont stunt for four star trek in

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:54,370
London where we unannounced flutist at

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:57,490
work logo in London next to the mayor to

00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:01,740
the outhouse and we managed to fly one

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:04,030
of the copters in the vatos but nothing

00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,600
nothing happened he wasn't in his office

00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,490
so and this this this really got us

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,230
going because in the end it was just I

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,780
think it was 600,000 views on the

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:16,420
internet and even the Star Trek because

00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,880
the the day they really liked it too and

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,230
then we got a lot of requests and then

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:26,260
with all about how we could turn it into

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:28,570
a viable business model rented out and

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:34,380
it looks like that a lot of people are

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:39,850
interested in renting this practically

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:42,840
and so I guess I got confused with my

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,840
own thing here

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,320
yeah man this is the moment where I

00:22:49,370 --> 00:23:03,290
should try to show you the LED animation

00:22:51,320 --> 00:23:07,990
but not quite sure if it works no it's

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,990
not going to work into about this yeah

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,490
it does a color cycling yet like you

00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,170
have seen but I can't show you because

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,480
it's not going to work it should work

00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:20,420
that the Elliot modem is communicating

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,640
with that your own and and shows you

00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,530
some color cycling i will just well I'm

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,630
talking to try to we started one more

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,020
time and then maybe it works but I don't

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,020
think so

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:45,040
so okay back to the software guess you

00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:48,850
might be interesting how how the whole

00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:53,290
thing is done we with the original

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:56,530
version it was was done in opengl this

00:23:53,290 --> 00:24:00,610
one and we we really thought about how

00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:02,650
we could turn this into a a product that

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:05,950
could be license license would mean that

00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,900
it that the handling is so easy that it

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:11,559
can be installed on windows and people

00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:13,929
really know what to do with it we had a

00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:18,600
lot of work to do when we flew in

00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:21,929
australia because the Civil Aviation

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:26,650
Authority they have worried about our

00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:29,770
shoulder they forced us to do define a

00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:33,280
lot of security features we had before

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:34,960
but didn't document like a geofence when

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,260
the drone is leaving a certain area it

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:42,370
automatically design so it gets flown

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:46,150
back and we have now features like we

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:49,150
can really sent them home one by one if

00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:51,669
they go too far we lose communication we

00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:53,590
can sent them home and this is all in

00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:56,200
the software is really nice buttons

00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:59,290
where you can just watch them even if

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,350
they have a better we lost we we see all

00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:06,059
of these thinking can react to this so

00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:08,559
we decided to turn this into a C++

00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:11,590
programming model a program where we can

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,890
freely add something all the time and it

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:17,620
is now in the status where we could with

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:22,750
a proper training hand it over to

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:24,370
somebody if he gets the quadcopters we

00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,860
trained him on him get some maintenance

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,929
training we could probably hand it over

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:34,390
we're working on it if it really works

00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:35,710
like this because usually we know it's

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:39,910
not that easy because this quadcopter

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:41,830
sometimes do something like this one and

00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,320
so but this this would be the way to go

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:47,830
through this is very advanced status now

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:52,080
of the software and if anybody is

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:54,990
interested in learning more about it

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,210
you can freely contact us and as soon as

00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,649
it's not too special we probably could

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,049
really answer your questions how we

00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:03,029
approach this it looks like at the

00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:06,049
moment that we are the only ones flying

00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:12,419
out to us one we are not sure why since

00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:16,549
2012 mmm to my minutes ago i'm dead slow

00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:18,929
or that faster thought okay have ya so

00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:23,730
in a certain sense we seem to be pretty

00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:26,269
advanced with this and some people to

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:32,090
either fly but to mess it auto shows

00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:32,090
obviously we are the cougars the moment

00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:38,549
and volume aight might expect in this

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,889
year if we if we get through all the

00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:44,250
legal stuff and all that stuff like that

00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:47,070
we might fly away bigger swarm if we do

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:50,309
this you will see on youtube definitely

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:54,690
like everything and so our next plane

00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:56,340
would be to really fly up to 100 if we

00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,250
could do this already but we need

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,470
somebody who wants to finance the stunt

00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,380
because this quad copters are very

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,720
expensive but you might see it in the

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,940
future two entries because I probably

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,409
want me live I want to show you

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:16,380
something it's just just in Tucson

00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:19,080
various no it's just not a lot it's not

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:23,700
made completely seriously go what I

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,070
would like to do is like business we go

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:30,200
our same water work to earn by all these

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,200
great places so that is thank you

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,130
