Title: Kod.io 2014 - Spaxels - Ars Electronica Quadcopter Swarm by Chris Bruckmayr

Description: 
	The Spaxels, the 3d-Pixels that the Ars Electronica Futurelab has created based on quadcopter-technology, have proven their skills to paint logos and animations into the sky a number of times.
The idea is both simpel and powerful: In order to create more complex 3d-forms than you usually could with the limited amount of Spaxels, you use a so-called Real Time Lightning Paint Video System.

The human eye can only perceive lightsources, but can't really track their light-trail, something that cameras can do.

They are set up for long-exposure-shots and through this, you can create complex 3d-models out of nowhere, using the Spaxels, cameras and screens.
