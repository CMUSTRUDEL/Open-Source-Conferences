Description: 
	We use color every day, but how well do we really understand it?
More often than not, we are merely scratching the surface of a large and complicated discipline.

In this dynamic session, we will scratch a little deeper, and you will be surprised at how deep the colorful rabbit hole goes.

How does color work on our screens? What's the difference between color models and color spaces? Which existing features of CSS Color are we underutilizing?

What's in store for CSS Color level 4? How can we pick both aesthetically pleasing and accessible color combinations?

This is not a design talk, it's a technical talk about the inner workings of one of the most important design aspects, with many practical takeaways.

Whether you identify as a designer or a developer, you will walk out of this session with a newfound confidence about anything color related.
