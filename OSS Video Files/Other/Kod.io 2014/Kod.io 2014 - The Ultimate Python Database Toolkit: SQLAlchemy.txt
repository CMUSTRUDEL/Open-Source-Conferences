Meet SQLAlchemy. A high performing, mature, easy, non-opinionated database toolkit which doesn't get in your way
SQLAlchemy does exactly what you command it to do. You can turn it into a highly usable ORM or use it as an impressive SQL abstraction toolkit.

We are going to discuss the basics of this great tool and compare it to other existing libraries.

It's worth noting that SQLAlchemy is used by Reddit, Uber, Fedora, Mozilla, Dropbox and many other companies for years.

It's time to exit via dolorosa.

Your presence is expected.
