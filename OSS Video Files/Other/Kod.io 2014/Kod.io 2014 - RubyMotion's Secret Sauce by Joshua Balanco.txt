Title: Kod.io 2014 - RubyMotion's Secret Sauce by Joshua Balanco
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: Kod.io 2014
Description: 
	On the surface, RubyMotion is a tool that let's developers use Ruby to create desktop and mobile applications.
Look a bit deeper, though, and you'll find a community of developers actually having fun building libraries, coming up with new ways to design apps, and sharing what they've learned with each other.

In this talk, we'll go over how to get started with RubyMotion, look at some of the features that make it so much fun to work with, and briefly survey some of the many available libraries.

In the end, even if your next app isn't a RubyMotion app, hopefully you'll at least catch the spirit embodied by the RubyMotion community.
