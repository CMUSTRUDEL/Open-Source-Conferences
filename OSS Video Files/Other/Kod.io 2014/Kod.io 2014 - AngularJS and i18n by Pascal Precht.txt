Title: Kod.io 2014 - AngularJS and i18n by Pascal Precht
Publication date: 2020-01-24

Description: 
	Building Single Page Applications with the AngularJS Framework works like a charm.
It gives you Dependency Injection, Two-Way Data-Binding and it's built with testability in mind.

Another feature of AngularJS is localization. This, however, is restricted to datetime, number and currency operations on a filter level.

Pascal will show you how to go beyond the basic AngularJS localization support with the angular-translate module, by making use of the provided Two-Way Data-Binding mechanism.

This talk is especially for people who haven't done much with AngularJS yet.
