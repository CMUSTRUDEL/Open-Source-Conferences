people just call me Scotty so I'm that's

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,770
who I am my name is scotty Steve Scott

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,000
is what my mother calls me well she

00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,060
doesn't use the last bit she just calls

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,980
me Steve Steven if I'm in trouble that's

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,260
it that's my Twitter handle I'm

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,250
currently I do have lots of different

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,890
roles in life i'm an independent

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,540
developer i run a conference myself i'm

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,660
also the developer evangelist for a

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,040
company called REM objects who you may

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,390
or may not have heard of and i'll

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,390
mention them a little bit later on i

00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,730
have never been to a conference in

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,239
austria before this is my first one so i

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,040
have no idea what you guys are like I've

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,019
know you could be the nicest people in

00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,979
the world or you could be a complete

00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,479
nightmare I really don't know and when I

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,860
normally do conference talks I normally

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,600
sit at the back and I take note of

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,520
what's going on and I see if you have

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
the crater it bit serious or whether

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,180
they're light hearted whether they

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,580
prefer an overview or whether they

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,350
prefer the technical staff and I tried

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,120
then adapt to what's going on but then

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,400
suddenly it was almost with horror last

00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,920
night I was I'm first I've got no idea

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,870
so if you don't like what I've got to

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,360
say this morning blame the person who

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:37,400
put me first okay not me that's all I'm

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,420
going to say from the airport yesterday

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,400
got picked up with a bunch of other

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,110
speakers yo you're in that situation

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,370
with a whole group of people you don't

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,980
know but you know that you're all

00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,960
techies of some form in your geeks so

00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,950
you start talking about technology

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,810
because it's the only thing you know

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,030
you've got in common right now it

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,410
doesn't take long and then you just

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,240
start saying about all i remember when i

00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,070
was doing this members do now and the

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,480
longer the journey gets the younger you

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,090
get in what the technology you were

00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,740
talking about and I suddenly realize

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,900
that I could go a lot back a lot further

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,819
than most people in the bus when people

00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,440
started saying things like I used to go

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,620
into the library and they'd only let me

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,300
use the internet for 30 minutes and I

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,970
used to get really frustrated when I was

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,379
a kid and I used to think libraries

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,629
didn't even know what computers were

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,940
when I was a kid yeah they don't just

00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:27,810
discovered books let alone a little

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,520
tails and so I just wanted to it just

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,770
made me realize how old I am which was

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,360
really sad but never mind

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,620
but I just wanted to put some of what

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,420
I'm saying today in context of where

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,260
I've come from because my opinions will

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,750
be based on where I've come from this

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,790
was my first computer anybody remember

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,920
one of these no I'm looking around the

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,450
room you also oh there's a few people he

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,840
had tried to say I'm not the oldest in

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:57,450
the room either no no no there we are

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,800
the zx81 yes it was it was very big but

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,240
i can't help it i lived in britain like

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,740
oh nice I think I mean there was no

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,750
internet I couldn't order from Austria

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,300
so I had to just go down in the local

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,380
store the specs on this thing were quite

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:13,830
impressive it had a 3.25 megahertz no

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,020
gigahertz megahertz CPU of course but

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,660
the effective speed of the CPU in slow

00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:22,050
mode now note slow mode is whenever you

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,870
have the display turned on ok the

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,510
effective cpu speed is slow mode was

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,990
naught point 804 megahertz if you had a

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,730
50 megahertz display or not point 534

00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,500
had a 60 Hertz display which is

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,900
understandable you've lost what they're

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,690
eighty percent of your CPU power to

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:44,190
drive that really impressive 32 x 24

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:47,100
character display which was a whole 256

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:51,510
by 192 pixels or if you wanted to be in

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:56,660
the road it worked 64 x 48 dots this

00:03:51,510 --> 00:04:00,209
thing was a beast ok it had 1k of memory

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,800
1k of memory does anybody even recognize

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,310
what a que is these days it's it's so

00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,610
small we don't even work in it anymore

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,410
it costs 49 pounds in ninety five pence

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,300
but it which is about 60 euros in

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,310
today's money that's about a hundred and

00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:19,169
ninety six euros which was amazing yo

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,980
remember that the cheapest computer you

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:21,959
could probably buy was probably

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,460
thousands of euros what the euro didn't

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,350
even exist at the time but thousands of

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,950
whatever currency you were using at the

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,110
time so but of course it was 4995 if you

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,060
bought it in kit form and you had to pay

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,040
6995 if you wanted someone to put it

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:40,350
together for you so that's where I

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:43,320
started and you know I always been a

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,660
power user so it was no good to me just

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:52,560
having this one care memory so I bought

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:55,890
the 16k Ram expansion pack for 60 pounds

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,160
more than the computer costs here to get

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:03,720
an extra 16k of memory into this beast

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,640
to make things work for me and the

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,380
trouble is with this thing it plugged

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,560
into a port on the back of the computer

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,630
and if once it was plugged in if you

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,630
even move the computer just a little bit

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,580
it would fall out now of course there's

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,960
no disk driving this thing there's no

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,280
floppies in this thing if you wanted to

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,500
save anything it was about three days

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,370
saving it to cassette some of you are

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,870
probably too young to even remember

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,390
cassettes I mean that's the type of

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,470
audience were speaking to hear but isn't

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:33,330
there so actually my really high-end

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,910
desk in my bedroom office number I was

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,790
still a kid you know I had to tape the

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,130
computer to the desk to make sure the

00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:45,740
ramp at didn't fall out so this is where

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:48,540
I began and my programming career began

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,180
like so many programming careers of

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,970
people my age with this program oh it's

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:58,800
not even all on the screen 10 print

00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:02,310
Scotty is amazing 20 go to 10 come on

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,900
who started there anybody yes it's a few

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:09,570
people who stutter and I remember that

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:12,210
complete joy as I saw ah that was it it

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,500
was amazing and so the only reason I'm

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,440
doing this is firstly to start

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,310
establishing that when I talk about some

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,590
of the stuff I'm going to talk about

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,300
today I've been through quite a lot of

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:26,580
generations of people talking about this

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:29,130
and opinions change if you're lucky some

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,140
people's down and I love is that that

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,270
there and equally I just wanted to honor

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,270
the zx81 so from now on this is a

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,610
genuine zx81 font for which the rest of

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:44,750
the presentation will be done in just to

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,750
just to honor those edits 81 okay so

00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,860
these are the other platforms that I

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,470
have worked on and we can't see some of

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,750
them have all gone off the screen there

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,910
said x 81 there's an expectant which

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,160
followed there's an oreck a Commodore 64

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,690
I was speaking to

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,130
go yesterday instead of not done any

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,050
programming for it but I realized I then

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,760
had there's an Amiga there's these

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,640
beasts of mainframes called primal

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,670
machines which don't exist anymore CPM

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,940
convergent UNIX vme which was icls based

00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,770
VMs which was vax based vm 317 MVS which

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,250
is IBM mainframe base I've developed for

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,750
windows 33 195 NT 2000 XP Vista and

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,290
eight I realized I'd never did anything

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,730
for windows 7 ever the list is a

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,760
graphical developed something just for

00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:32,850
windows seven so I can complete the list

00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:37,860
this says os/2 anybody remember os/2 yes

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:41,010
I loved os/2 yo it was amazing and some

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,830
linux stuff OS 10 which is now just X on

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,770
their iOS and Android so those are

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,530
platforms that I've done software for

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,810
probably from one two three four five

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,760
five after five down of debris vivid

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:59,640
commercial software for the rest of our

00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:01,560
hobbies before that okay and these again

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,930
are the languages in which I've

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,370
delivered software of which we cannot

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:10,770
see most of them basic Pascal Fortran

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,990
pase pase was this 1980s

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:18,510
fourth-generation language which I am so

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:20,280
glad died cobol debase i think the one

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,110
that's totally missing must be c because

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,180
it's a single letter so it's gone off

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,830
there another four GL which is still

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,250
exists but i think it's got three users

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,950
called mantis PL one programming

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,330
language one that was an IBM programming

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,890
language they were that inventive in

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,690
those days it was the first one they

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,340
done so it was programming language one

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,789
it's like a Pascal variant it was an

00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,140
amazing language assembly language I had

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,850
to learn assembly language when I was

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,260
working a project in the nuclear

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,180
industry industry we were moving

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,010
software from one machine to another

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,660
machine and we come across all this

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,220
assembly code that no one knew what it

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,570
did and we thought before we build it

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,370
and compile it and deploy in a nuclear

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,350
power station we should probably work

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,020
out what it does so that's what I first

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,060
learned assembly language object spell

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,400
from paradox for Windows anybody

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,940
remember paradox for windows object

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,910
Pascal pearl I've turn on work out what

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,990
they are l was a pearl C++ Java visual

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,020
basic both standard

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,250
dotnet objective-c I have no idea what

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,279
the one off there was I just look at my

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,709
own screen and I see sharp yes PHP Ruby

00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,180
JavaScript and I put CoffeeScript in

00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,160
there as well because i know that's a

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,370
variant but there we are so I've worked

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,620
in quite a lot languages and so over the

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,149
years I've been through most of the

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,830
arguments about what's good what's not

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,420
good what works what doesn't work why

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,220
things are better why things aren't

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,200
better all I'm trying to do is

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,010
demonstrate to hear that I'm not a

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,779
fanboy I'm not a yo this is my one idea

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,670
and this is all its way yeah I've lived

00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,870
through this stuff okay so some of the

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,420
things I say come from hard experience

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,010
and some of it because I have an opinion

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,440
despite what I've learned but there we

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,080
are we're always going to have that okay

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,450
so what am i actually supposed to be

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,000
talking about platform native

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:07,709
applications or lat form native

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,140
applications is where now log on to note

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:12,649
number two for future conferences do not

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:18,000
put slides to edge of screen okay

00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:20,399
platform native applications so I guess

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,110
the question is to start with what is

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,459
native what is native and one of the

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,670
things as I was beginning to think about

00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:31,320
this is fact let's just do a quick

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,240
survey of the room who here are

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,430
primarily consider themselves web

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:41,510
developers front or back end okay

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:47,520
desktop and mobile sort of developers

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:51,120
designers at the wrong conference okay

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,790
right we're okay so I'm roughly talking

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,649
to you know the right set of people in

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,570
it seems like a few web people in here

00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,550
which I will talk about a little bit as

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:03,450
well but they've all gone downstairs to

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:05,880
learn about color here we are which is

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,500
very important unless you've got a zx81

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,839
which was black and white so there we

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:15,720
are okay so one is native well in the

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,820
days when I started this was native this

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,950
is what we were talking about it was it

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,540
but it's this is totally irrelevant

00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,339
these days I mean no it's not irrelevant

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,430
if your code doesn't end up like that

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,899
somewhere it doesn't run okay but

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,850
is not relevant to us the last time

00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,800
anybody thought about what was actually

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,870
being written at this level was a long

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,580
long time ago it for most of us as

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:40,260
developers so I guess more important

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,660
there's a question not what is native

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:47,459
but what is platform because we're

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:49,230
talking about platform native I've none

00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,220
of my presenter notes are displaying but

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,930
we'll work it out so i'll probably be

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,940
going back in a minute to the stuff that

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,120
i didn't tell you that i should have

00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,220
told you ok but it's it's ok it's

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,209
morning you're still awake ish so is

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:08,690
there so what is platform well again

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:11,100
this is a changing dynamic over time and

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,570
one of the problems of the internet and

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,000
one of the great things about the

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,459
internet is information tends to not go

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,470
away so when you begin to do searches on

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:22,190
things you get stuff and it may now be

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,420
up to an amazing sort of 15 years old

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,130
and totally irrelevant but it's still

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,510
there and it still forms the argument

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,560
today and it's in there and it's quite

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,880
interesting watch these some of these

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
things come through but I guess

00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,420
traditionally if we're talking about

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,230
platform we're talking about the

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:39,180
operating system so what is yeah what is

00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,880
a platform native when we're beginning

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,380
to talk about the operating system well

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,300
I guess traditionally we're talking

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,450
about is it using something like the

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,089
win32 API if you're on Windows is it

00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,709
using the core fundamental see libraries

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:55,800
of a linux machine is it using core

00:12:52,709 --> 00:13:00,870
foundation on a Mac os10 machine this is

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:02,640
what would be seen as native and there

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,130
was a lot of arguments especially in the

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,870
the mid-90s in the early 90s about you

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,839
know you doing anything that moved away

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:14,339
from just writing it's the raw api's for

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,810
an operating system was non-native you

00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,390
have to put that into context that

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,839
machines were really really slow in

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:24,240
those days and any abstraction from the

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,149
raw layer was seen as a problem any

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,800
abstraction that came from that didn't

00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:30,779
put you right in touch with the rawness

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,420
of the machine was it was seen as an

00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:36,329
issue that you had to work around and so

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,240
this this issue of native back in the

00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:40,230
days when this argument first began was

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,900
more to do with

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:46,170
performance and speed than it was to do

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,790
with really convenience or the final

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,220
solution you're going to deliver because

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:54,900
the reality was for some of the non

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:57,270
native platforms api's began to rise at

00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,340
the time they were great as a developer

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,590
apart from no machine could run them any

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,540
average human being had less you happen

00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,480
to you be deploying to cray users or

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,830
something that's a create a craven

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,390
around anymore they were the

00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:14,610
supercomputers of the day I don't know

00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:17,300
if they even small so the OS was the was

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,460
the thing that everybody argued about

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,070
but then towards the end of the second

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:27,660
half of the 90s we began to see platform

00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:30,210
frameworks arising and this was where

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,800
maybe even the vendors themselves were

00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,680
beginning to put abstraction layers on

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,830
top of their OS stuff so with windows

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:41,270
we're talking probably 98 99 when the

00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:44,040
dotnet frameworks were beginning to

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,930
appear now I was working in the windows

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,370
work this time I was a Delphie developer

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:51,450
or a delphi developer depend on which

00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:53,160
part of the world you come from and you

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,660
know the whole argument that was going

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,340
on and range at the time is this whole

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,900
dotnet stuff is completely useless

00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:03,780
because it's just not native okay

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,340
because the the Delphie stuff the ballin

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,290
guys at the time they'd written this

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,120
control library called the VCL the

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,500
visual control library it had turned

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,780
windows development to something you

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,640
could actually manage I was speaking

00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,170
with someone in the bar last night and I

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,590
remember the first time I ever wrote a

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,630
windows program in C and I was literally

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:25,380
I was learning it at the same time it

00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:27,120
was a windows 3.0 and it took me about

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,520
10 days to get the first window on the

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,840
screen because when you started a

00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,740
program back then the first thing you

00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,570
have to do is work out how you're going

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,580
to handle a message loop and then how

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,960
you were going to begin to put those

00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,360
messages out to windows and then have

00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,100
the windows and and you so what you get

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,020
when you do far new program was two

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,390
weeks work back in those days when you

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,530
were trying to learn this stuff and so

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,670
this is the environment is coming up

00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,680
from so this thing called the visual

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,450
control library had to come along but

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,130
this was your the big thing about it was

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,150
as it compiled straight down to the

00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,820
win32 api

00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:58,620
then this dotnet stuff comes along and

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,000
it's in it's got an abstraction from

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,550
that and the big argument was well it's

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,020
not native and native is just not if

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,520
it's not native it's just not fast

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:15,360
enough the argument was still about

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:16,710
speed they lost the argument platform

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,510
frameworks are probably the way that

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,820
most people see native development today

00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,230
so when I say platform frameworks I

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,000
think you know you're not going to get

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,220
many arguments today that dot net is not

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,630
writing natively for the platform the

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,950
windows and he don't let developers in

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:35,730
here you'd have to be embarrassed sir be

00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:37,410
proud yeah there is a behavior policy in

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:41,850
here nobody can pick on you for it

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:45,480
honestly the code of conduct protects

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,680
you and you've got some friends over

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,570
there if you want to go see them later

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:53,190
on form a little click here okay so

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,340
dotnet it is probably casinos native

00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:59,220
cocoa on Mac OS 10 any Mac developers

00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,540
here I'll see they're all in a huddle at

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,980
the back they found each other before

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:08,100
the show yeah she prepared an advanced

00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:10,500
cocoa touch iOS developers know about

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,630
the same people cocoa-touch seen on

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,020
there delva Khan the Android platform

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,459
android developers yeah we're fairly

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,900
evenly spread we are a very quite

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,040
representative group unless it's the

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,920
same people from that hands up for all

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:28,470
of these these and I considered the

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,060
platform frameworks and these are

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,910
probably these days considered native

00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,870
whereas back 10 15 years ago the

00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,820
argument would have been they're not

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,970
native where's now the argument is

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,440
totally changed something that is

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:44,130
probably the modern argument that is

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:48,480
going on and is this whole thing about

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:52,260
html5 versus native web versus native

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,360
but I think just looking back it how

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,530
history goes to me it's the wrong

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,540
argument that's going on and eventually

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,630
we'll get mature enough when we work

00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,250
that out the fact is it's not a matter

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,590
of whether HTML is native or not is a

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,080
matter of how we view the browser what

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,130
is the browser and as long as we

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,870
continue to live

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,420
in the area of the era that the browser

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,400
was something we used that used to look

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,500
at websites and brochures and

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,050
information this argument will keep on

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:23,250
raging as soon as we come to accept that

00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:25,350
the browser itself is a platform then

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,590
immediately html5 and JavaScript become

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,940
native to the platform that make sense

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,560
you see the brighter is far more it's in

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,050
I've you have to view the browser but I

00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,570
fire up Safari or I fire up Chrome these

00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:40,770
days I view it exactly the same way is

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:43,680
if I'm i use a mac mainly if I'm firing

00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,480
up a virtual machine running windows on

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,520
my mac i see it exactly the same way i

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,340
am firing up an alternative environment

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,510
and so what we now have is the tools and

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,400
a native to the environment you're

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,830
working on a problem is under spagh

00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,950
inning to understand our environment

00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,090
okay so what is the problem I'm supposed

00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:03,390
to be talking about that I've left

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:07,710
myself nine minutes to talk about okay

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:09,420
is the problem that people are seeing

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,150
more and more need these days to deploy

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,720
on more and more platforms and if you

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:19,530
want to remain platform native you have

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:23,040
to learn all these different api's so

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:26,490
that's that's the problem that people

00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:29,430
often try and solve and so the real

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,710
native non-native arguments that go on

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,650
today are about whether you have to do

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,120
everything's for a specific platform or

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,290
whether you can do stuff that is

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,790
cross-platform and tries to make it work

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,050
so cross platform is the current

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:47,700
argument and that's what I'm going to

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:50,070
talk about just a little bit let's get

00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,720
one thing straight okay I'm not saying

00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,640
this is wrong but this is a fact and we

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,290
have to live with it cross-platform is

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,320
for the convenience of the developer and

00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:02,280
nobody else full stop cross-platform

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,140
never ever benefits the user it may not

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,780
hinder the user it may not get in the

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,940
way of the user they may have no idea of

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,990
it as a user however cross-platform is

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,770
there for one purpose and one purpose

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:16,170
only to make your life easier that's it

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:19,290
so we could if we were going to say

00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:21,730
about it has to be about the best

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,830
experience ever for the user

00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,810
then cross-platform currently in its

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,490
current form 10 years time five years

00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,710
tom burglar is never going to deliver

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,750
that can it deliver a good enough

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,980
experience for the user can it deliver

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,740
something that where the user may not

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,500
even know is a different question but

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,790
it's not so in an ideal world as a

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,400
techie you are never going to sit there

00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,780
and say cross-platform is best what you

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,700
might have to say is it's best for me

00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,300
right now with the resources I have and

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,830
the things I'm looking to achieve okay

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,240
so you know what sort of things am I

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,680
talking about with cross-platform things

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,500
like the mono framework anybody use them

00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,460
on a framework okay some of the dotnet

00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,990
developers are putting their hands up

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,400
again the mono framework is basically

00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,380
trying to take dotnet and put it to

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,330
every platform okay so that you can

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,750
basically write dotnet code and then

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,860
just move it around okay mono is an

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,060
example of something that's trying to

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,790
move virtually the whole development

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,710
experience probably more common and been

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,740
around longer are things like cute or

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:20,190
cutie which are more or gtk which are

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,940
graphics frameworks which try and bring

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,440
the fact that you only have to write

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,650
your graphics code once and bring it to

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:33,220
different platforms the problem there

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:35,770
are with them is you've just removed

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,380
yourself from the Nate from the actual

00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,150
platforms experience and I depending on

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,550
which platform you're using that has

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,900
different effects so for example for

00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,140
many years if you were a cutie user

00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,150
acute user they did all the drawing by

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,680
themselves so no matter which platform

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,400
you were working on the button would

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,630
look exactly the same okay and then they

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,770
began to all the drawing themselves but

00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,420
try and make it look like more like the

00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:01,180
platform buttons then I think in recent

00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:03,160
releases it now will use if you draw a

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,990
button on Mac Mac os10 the cute library

00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,430
will use the native control from the

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,230
native libraries and on Windows that we

00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,850
use the native control from the native

00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,700
libraries and it's beginning to look

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,280
more native I'm going to keep using that

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,140
word but it means loads of things it's a

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,790
look more native the problem you have is

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,470
a developer is you are always dependent

00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,500
on the library provider to keep up to

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,910
date you are always you know and how

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,880
they're choosing to implement it and

00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:30,010
you're always in that position that if

00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,590
they choose not to implement something

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,510
you don't get it you're always in the

00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,700
position some know sometimes you're in

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,320
the position the

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,700
what you do on this system just doesn't

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,800
make sense on this system but you're

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,240
tied to doing it that way so you even

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,860
though you may be saving hours and hours

00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,480
of development time you were always in a

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,740
compromise and I think you just have to

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,240
accept that I'm not saying these

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,570
libraries are wrong by any means at all

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,760
they have a place sometimes they are the

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,730
perfect solution but you always have to

00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,500
accept you i'm making a compromise okay

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,550
just to show i'm not totally bigoted i

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,670
use a number of cross-platform

00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:05,620
applications this is app code it's a

00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:09,760
java application it's where i do on my

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:12,190
objective c editing it's a brilliant

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,540
editor it does brilliant refactoring but

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,270
like most things written in java is

00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:19,390
totally butt-ugly which is a Mac

00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:22,090
Developer really hurts me really good so

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,340
it was a Java developer or there's more

00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:28,420
than the dotnet people who do but Java

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,250
is nice but just butt-ugly okay this is

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,570
an app called post box it's the mail app

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,840
I use because i don't like mailed an app

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,610
on the mac this is a cross-platform app

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,860
and the developers of this app have gone

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,780
to a lot of effort to make it look like

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,760
a mac app and a lot of effort to make it

00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,440
behave like a mac app and accept the

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,810
same keyboard shortcuts and all those

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,120
things and most of the time i forget i'm

00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,500
using a cross platform app until i get

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,030
into the text editor and it doesn't

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,170
support any of the operation operating

00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:58,150
system native stuff or the other tools

00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,770
that i run such as text expander which

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,330
allowed me to to type two or three

00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,010
characters and then expands out to

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,720
something else don't run because it's

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,280
not using a native text control from the

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,110
operating system so there are always

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,110
little things i've got four minutes and

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,960
left speed up so there is a big

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:17,770
difference between trying to replace a

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,360
platform and replace a tool in the

00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,500
platform so for example let me start

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,780
talking about where i'm coming from a

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,910
prime objects we started with producing

00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,560
a product called data abstract it's all

00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,360
about being able to keep data out

00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,040
somewhere in the cloud and a server on

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,130
your own servers then have sort of

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,990
remote access to it from your mobile

00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,760
application or your desktop application

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,080
briefcase in models or if you're offline

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,760
all that sort of stuff stuff that's

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,370
really quite trendy now even though this

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,870
was started donkey's years ago the

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,600
problems are still the same almost every

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,310
major databases written expecting that

00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,010
the client will be on a local

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:54,010
work and none of the clients spit my

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,690
sequel postgres whatever written in a

00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,250
way that they handle if the data

00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,630
screaming across the network is there

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,550
just terrible you have to put some other

00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,960
solution in place now we had to start

00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:06,370
looking to producing clients for net

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,720
java iOS and at the mac and we actually

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,040
did a Delphie client as well cuz this is

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,040
where rim objects history was back in

00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,800
Delphie and had to make a choice how

00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,020
these were going to happen and we made

00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,020
the choice at the time that actually the

00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,180
developers using these will want to have

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,880
a native experience they want their they

00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,320
want the API in their environment to

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,000
work the same way that they're used to

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,770
API is working in their environment and

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,380
so we had to be wrote each one

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,360
individually going on there you see

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,280
because although developers are happy to

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,780
write cross framework applications to

00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,370
deliver their to their users they're

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,390
probably not happy to be delivered

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:47,470
cross-platform applications that put any

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:49,240
limitations on them at all no one ever

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:53,800
said we were fair did it if so there we

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:56,830
are okay so during this process remember

00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:59,410
to have a product called oxygen which is

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:03,160
a basically as a dotnet as started off

00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:04,390
as a dotnet pascal compiler when because

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,330
it comes from adelphi heritage when

00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:09,310
Borland decided not support net Rome

00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,260
objects started a.net Pascal co-pilots

00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:13,470
based on object Pascal eventually became

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,340
prism that was inside the Delphie

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,190
toolset if you've ever been a Delphie

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:20,320
user it's no longer in there and then a

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,390
couple of years ago got two minutes old

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,950
yeah a couple of years ago began to say

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,050
well how can we take this to a different

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,940
set of platforms and we began to look

00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,140
how could we compile this stuff to for

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:34,360
Android how could we use this stuff for

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:36,460
iOS how could we do this stuff for for

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,530
iOS n for mac and we made the decision

00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,510
based on the stuff that I've just been

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:46,900
saying and in other arguments that

00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:48,580
actually we need to bring efficiency and

00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,410
productivity where it makes sense

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,660
without compromising the platform

00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:55,330
uniqueness in other words we wanted to

00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,950
be a cross-platform vendor but we

00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,060
weren't going to do cross-platform what

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,660
we were going to do is try and bring

00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:03,490
bring productivity to make cross

00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,050
from easier for people without them

00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,180
having to give up the ability to access

00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,190
the fullness of a platform so in other

00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:12,070
words you could use the same language in

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:14,260
the same IDE to develop for every

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:17,740
platform but you still developed to

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:19,600
every platforms API okay now for us at

00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:24,010
the time it was object Pascal the IDE

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,810
was visual studio as of today and today

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,240
literally nine o'clock this morning that

00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,380
changed because as of today we released

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,210
you're going to be the first people in

00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,710
the world to hear this there you are

00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:36,430
don't say you were privileged we have

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,260
released REM objet C sharp so now we

00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,990
have produced a totally native

00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:43,360
cross-platform C sharp so you can write

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:47,610
from him with a visual studio still we

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:50,290
may add to that later on c-sharp code

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:52,570
specifically for iOS or specifically for

00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:54,100
Android the dalvik library specifically

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,230
for thing because we decided this is the

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,680
way to go try and make the experience at

00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:01,360
least painful to take the best choice so

00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,420
for example this is some Android code in

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,790
C sharp you can see it's the 3 C sharp

00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,800
developers in the room will appreciate

00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:12,040
this is C sharp but we're using the

00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,170
Android libraries we're using intense

00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,880
we're using activities this is an

00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,500
Android application we've just taken the

00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,560
language into C sharp and you can write

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,270
it in windows if you're still in there

00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,550
for example this is a uitableview code

00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:28,240
witness from an iOS application written

00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:30,700
in C sharp the point being here is then

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,290
on top of this we can take an extension

00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,300
that we can then begin to add platform

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:38,230
conveniences so for example we've added

00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,820
link to iOS and Android but we're never

00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,980
at the expense of cutting you off from

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,650
the api's can I have one more minute

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,420
thank you but never at the expense of

00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:52,810
debt and that's the point here because

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:54,850
we believe and I believe sir suma the in

00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,740
order to produce really really cool apps

00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,240
for a platform you've got to get right

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,730
down into the platform and use the

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,290
platform at its best and although a

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,450
total cross-platform thing may be

00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:07,270
convenient and it may be appropriate and

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:09,100
work at the end of day as developers we

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,900
like to do good technical work and

00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,600
that's why we took this approach and I'm

00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,820
running at a time so

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,050
I'm just gonna remind you again this is

00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,110
my one piece of advice when you're

00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:23,330
thinking about Nativity and cross

00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,730
platform and the rest of it look for

00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:28,610
efficiencies and productivity where it

00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:31,070
makes sense but not at the expense of

00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:33,140
the uniqueness of the platform if your

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:36,590
users can't use that particular feature

00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:37,700
on iOS because you don't do iOS or they

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:41,840
can't use that particular Windows

00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:45,010
feature is your appt really good enough

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,750
and all of us like producing good work

00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:50,750
that's been really fast I've missed out

00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:55,630
half of it but that's probably a benefit

00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,630
