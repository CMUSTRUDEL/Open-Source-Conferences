Description: 
	By Mike Adolphs

In order to become a better developer you'll have to spend some time doing support.
Here at GitHub developers help out with support on a regular basis, leading to a better experience for our customers.

Some even work on both: half development, half support. I'm going to show you why I think support is awesome and how it makes you better at writing code!

before we going to start or before i'm

going to start about talking about

00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:31,470
support i want to share one of github

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:35,130
traditions with all of you as a 20 250

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:39,050
people strong company where 75 percent

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:42,270
of the people work remotely it's kind of

00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,360
yeah important to have strong traditions

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,670
in order to create strong Braun bonds

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,570
between people and one of these

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,400
traditions is called toasts and every

thank you folks

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:44,110
before i'm going to start about support

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:46,960
just let me say that yeah i just

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:49,300
mentioned that we've shipped adam a new

00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,830
editor which is based on web

00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,230
technologies and that's it's easily

00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,110
extensible so you might be interested in

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:59,860
trying that out you can find more about

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,570
it on adam do and it's currently by

just round robin else at my cat github

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,540
com or j dennis at github com james

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,840
dennis is the other github who joined me

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:16,000
on this trip so yeah basically just send

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:23,500
us an email and we'll get you hooked up

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,690
with an invite let's get started so I

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,850
think I've said this before but i'm mike

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,700
from github I work on technical support

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,360
for the enterprise product and that

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,690
ranges from giving git workflow advice /

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,910
debugging git repository corruptions or

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:43,030
two issues with the underlying Linux

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,130
operating system I would like to say

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,550
thank you first for having me here I

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:52,980
really appreciate the invite and i hope

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,980
the talk today will be worth your time

00:04:53,669 --> 00:05:00,040
when i started drafting the talk i asked

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,290
myself a simple question why should

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,160
everyone helped out with support from

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,600
time to time on a regular basis and of

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,790
course by the end of the talk we will

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,260
have found some answers to that that

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,260
will hopefully be interesting for you

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,720
before we dive into support let me tell

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,190
you also a few things about github

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,980
github is a hosting company for software

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,940
development projects that's what the

00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:30,640
wikipedia says our core products are get

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,160
up to come and get a better price get up

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,260
enterprises the unpromising of get calm

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,130
so that you can put get up essentially

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,750
in your company's internal network and

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:44,530
we're of course also a little more than

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,810
just the hosting company we offer good

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,950
training worldwide or on-site online or

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,770
on-site we sponsor events or host

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:56,130
drink or tea apps to connect with local

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,380
communities we have our very own YouTube

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:01,500
channel teaching you basically all

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:07,800
things get and we speak on conferences

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:10,500
about how we run things our mission is

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,110
to make it easier to work together than

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:20,610
to work alone that's essentially what

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:24,630
drives the entire company all right

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,720
here's a disclaimer I've personally have

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,430
always been a die-hard operations guy

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,800
spending most of my time on automating

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,780
infrastructure or making things faster

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,870
from the operating systems point of view

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,570
and when I've told my co-workers about

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,840
one and a half years ago at my former

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,780
company that I'm going to accept the

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:54,870
support gig they just had one big giant

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:57,540
question why here's why so support as a

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,600
job is much older than any other job in

00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,810
the computer business it's as old as

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,550
human cells stuff to each other remember

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,120
those conversations you've had with the

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,670
cave troll next to you yo doc that hand

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,370
x you've sold me two days ago literally

00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:18,120
just broke on first usage make me a new

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,970
one a couple hundred thousand years

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,470
later things became more interesting

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:26,010
when we opened up stores for the very

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,710
first time you know those general good

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,650
stores where you were able to buy almost

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:35,910
anything the ones that don't exist

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:37,770
anymore you can still find them in

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:41,240
Skyrim though or pretty much any other

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,240
computer role-playing game out there

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,500
however the thing about stores was that

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,230
you still had to go back to the shop to

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:57,350
get your broken through fixed right so

00:07:52,230 --> 00:08:01,260
in 1876 the telephone got invented in

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:03,150
1894 the switchboard and that brought

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:07,170
things to a whole new level when it

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:10,110
comes to support the adoption rate of

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:12,090
the telephone and the 20th century made

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:19,410
it a lot easier to receive and provide

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:21,450
support on the phone in the 1960s we

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,570
have sort of industrialized phone

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,910
support and invented the call center we

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,770
have put people in the cubicles and let

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,460
them talk to customers on the phone all

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:35,610
day long I love how they turned on all

00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,110
the screens in that room and did you

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,390
notice that no one seems to be working

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:45,840
there it's just a ridiculous book

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:48,000
environment I have to say anyhow this

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,770
picture is pretty much one of the

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,870
greatest examples for my why many people

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,690
think that working and support is an

00:08:51,870 --> 00:09:01,790
entry-level job are generally a bad idea

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:06,840
and this just has to end and I'm super

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:09,210
serious this just has to end and many of

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,520
the reason is because it's working in

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:17,790
support is neither of those neither an

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:19,890
entry-level job nor at that idea support

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,740
is not like working on an assembly line

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:26,720
and performing the steps over and over

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:30,030
again all day long it is more like

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,830
firefighting whether small and highly

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:35,430
trained team eager to learn new things

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:41,150
when required and enabling the user to

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,150
get back to work again I feel great now

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:52,020
so how do we run supported github we

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,420
have 26 people sitting all over the

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,290
world in all major time zones providing

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,290
email support only

00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:03,149
when we separate between support for

00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:06,660
github com and support for enterprise

00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:11,749
not because it makes the most sense but

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:14,339
mainly due to historical reasons the

00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:16,410
support team for that comes provides

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,050
support for github com and all of our

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,779
native clients that means technical

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,540
support for git repositories or the API

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,399
for instance but also account support or

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,670
incident management in case when the

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,230
things went horribly wrong the

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,809
enterprise team on the other hand takes

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,249
care of github enterprise only and

00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:38,519
that's mainly due to the products

00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:40,589
complexity the enterprise of our team

00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,649
also has to take over on-call shifts

00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:46,740
because we allow our users to escalate

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:48,540
tickets if needed so like when there's a

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,240
git repository that got corrupted first

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,430
one reason or a vm that doesn't boot up

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,129
anymore they can then escalate these

00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:02,699
issues and we get back to them within 30

00:10:56,129 --> 00:11:06,600
minutes both teams have in common that

00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:10,230
we commit to the various code bases that

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,740
get up on a regular basis so it's pretty

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,170
much a development job for instance if

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,720
there's a black we can fix by ourselves

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,879
we just fire that as an issue let's

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,009
crush the back issue a pull request ask

00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:27,870
for a review and get it merged into

00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:29,790
master if there's time we will also hack

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,230
on side projects together with other

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:36,629
developers like some internal thing

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:43,050
another enterprise feature that's also

00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:46,649
part of our job in the future we would

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:50,639
like to see both teams to collaborate a

00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:52,829
bit more and presumably one day in the

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,300
not too distant future we're going to

00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,300
merge ourselves in a single team

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:05,380
on certain occasions like popular

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,040
holidays when most people want to spend

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:11,080
time with their loved ones or for our an

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,080
annual internal conference for instance

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:17,820
the support team can let the bat signal

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,550
and that is sort of like the oh she

00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,740
please help button that people can push

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:27,959
and they'll reside in all the people

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,959
that get up helping out with support

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:35,350
then it's not just the support team

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:38,980
answering tickets anymore it is

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:41,140
everybody at github allowing the support

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,350
people to take part and the company's

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:47,670
culturals cultural activities without

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:52,779
stopping to make our users happy because

00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:54,790
support just never stops it doesn't

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:57,330
matter at all whether it's Independence

00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:06,130
Day New Year's Eve or your birthday

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:10,390
people won't stop asking questions at

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:18,070
github rerun support with a couple core

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:21,640
principles in mind one heart it's

00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,560
actually the opposite the first rule is

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,220
never get in a fight because it's not

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,779
worth it sometimes people are angry for

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,880
whatever reason and getting into a fight

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,880
with them is not going to help anybody

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,529
number two is don't insult your users

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:44,980
essentially never bite the hand that

00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:47,230
feeds you this goes along with the fact

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,810
that we also don't make fun of our user

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,810
base no matter how crazy people's

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:56,050
questions are our internal communication

00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:58,540
about these issues have them on such a

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,850
professional level that I wouldn't be

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:05,100
afraid giving our users our end users

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,100
access to those conversations

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:16,410
don't overuse I'm sorry is the next one

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:18,720
of course if we have messed things up

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,899
and if we took the site down for half a

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,300
day if we haven't fixed the back and get

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,660
up enterprise as soon as possible we do

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:30,120
apologize of course don't ever use I'm

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,269
sorry is more about not apologizing to

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,570
your users all day long like if you get

00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:39,540
a feature request that you've seen

00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,370
hundreds of times don't say I'm sorry

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,230
that we're not going to do that because

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:47,990
usually there are very good reasons why

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,990
the feature didn't end up in Gator calm

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:58,949
the fourth one is don't pretend to know

00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,779
everything instead be open and honest

00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:03,149
and tell users that you simply don't

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:05,459
know but that you will learn and

00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:08,750
investigate I ask the right people to

00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:11,399
help you out to get the issue resolved

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:14,519
these days knowing everything is just

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:22,880
not possible and pretty much anything is

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:27,269
is a team job these days the last one is

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,040
avoid advertising verbiage advertising

00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:32,250
new products in the support conversation

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,980
is usually no no don't do that you have

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:38,420
to focus on the solution and not on

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:42,660
pitching your new awesome shiny product

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:45,089
and it usually doesn't help anyway we

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,990
also we also never advertise our

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:52,470
products as better as CVS or that a

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:56,069
subversion and we also don't tell people

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,959
join get up it's free that doesn't

00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:00,029
happen there are very good reasons to

00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:03,740
join get up but that it's that most of

00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,740
its features is free isn't one of them

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:12,149
in a nutshell be a human and be nice and

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,980
if you can't be nice on that day for

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:16,680
some reason just hand the ticket over to

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,490
somebody else because you know we all

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,899
have these dark days very grumpy and got

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,899
sick of this planet

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,360
these principles I've just told you

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,900
about eventually result in happier users

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,150
that are called super fans the following

00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,890
example i'm going to show you is a short

00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:45,000
conversation between one of our users

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:47,130
and paul bets another github ah who's

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,490
developing software on our Native Client

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:55,320
ste clients team so the user asked us

00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,030
totally loving what you did with the

00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,220
windows client and being loyally using

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:04,290
it since it came out that does it really

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:07,500
need to take 2.5 gigabytes of space no

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:10,589
it doesn't so two hours later Paul

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,959
responded the following that's totally

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,790
not cool and not expected can you tell

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,690
us specifically which photos are taking

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:22,230
up so much space a couple minutes later

00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:23,640
the user get back to us as soon as I get

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,850
back home i'll send you the juicy

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,830
details that will happen tomorrow i must

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,900
say i'm positively surprised by your

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,970
responsiveness thought it would take a

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,350
day or two with the LA at the very least

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:39,660
for any reply to arrive ultimately we've

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,030
filed that as an issue got it fixed and

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,790
released a new version and because paul

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:47,670
interacts with the codebase regularly he

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,920
was able to get it fixed quickly this is

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:56,040
how you turn people essentially into

00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:57,750
superfans other examples are when we

00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,780
help people to fix get repository

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,070
corruptions or when they ran into some

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,790
other kind of problem with the

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:08,250
enterprise vm like jacques team just

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,110
tweeted just had a major good crisis at

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,030
work thankfully get a better price

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:16,260
report followed up and help us sort it

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:18,360
out worth every penny and dan said it

00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,000
needs to be said again get of enterprise

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,530
support people are amazing when you're

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,610
in a pinch and need help they deliver

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,680
there's a reason why i'm showing you

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:32,610
that and that's not because i love

00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:35,160
myself so much I just can't stress

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,860
enough how rewarding that is to see

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,900
people tweeting in public about the

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,900
support experience they've had

00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,300
and that constant and yes sometimes

00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,790
public feedback loop is one of the most

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,860
rewarding aspects of support jobs and

00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,510
that's also one of the things that you

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,390
will enjoy the most when helping out

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,340
with support from time to time because

00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:02,730
right everyone deserves a pat on the

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:05,130
shoulder from time to time so let's

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:11,880
answer that question already why how

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:14,570
about here's why helping out with the

00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,920
support results in more stable software

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,870
long-standing bugs usually get squashed

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,420
faster once the developer has seen

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,910
firsthand how a bug affects the users

00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,880
product experience like in the example

00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,580
with Paul and our windows client taking

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:34,860
up too much space that's one of the

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:38,760
aspects another one is it also provides

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,710
valuable insights on different levels so

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,330
ever wondered how the product you're

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,090
working on looks from the users

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:48,360
perspective helping out with support

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:51,330
will let you find out how's your

00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:57,840
company's reputation rest assured you'll

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:59,280
learn about that too there are also

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,610
learning to take away that have

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,790
applications outside of support like one

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:09,480
dish in the sink at a time so that

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:12,030
nothing gets smashed no seriously

00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,580
support helps you to learn to focus on

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:17,550
things and get them resolved it's it's

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,280
kind of a very simple workflow you just

00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,470
take one piece look at it get it

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,520
resolved and when working on complex

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:29,510
code that usually helps you to focus on

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,510
what's important and what's not

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:36,230
helping out in support also acts as a

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,110
great reminder whom you're actually

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,550
working for and that will provide you

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,950
with another perspective when it comes

00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,600
to implementing new features like does

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,720
it really make sense to add 10 more

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,420
fields to our signup page so that we can

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,090
get the users address and I know

00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:59,210
that's a little exaggerated but you've

00:20:53,090 --> 00:21:01,460
probably got the gist of it for the

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:05,740
things we have to learn before we can do

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:08,660
them we learn them by doing them on a

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,910
completely personal level when working

00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:14,780
in support your fast to constantly learn

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:17,120
new stuff and yeah mainly learn them by

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,090
doing there's a user waiting for reply

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,430
you just can't slack off that's there's

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,410
no way to do that you have to read up on

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:28,430
unique homes internals for instance or

00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:31,880
further debug other things to get to the

00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:34,130
core of the issue those can get tiresome

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,000
from time to time and that's also one of

00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:39,560
the reasons why full time support people

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,170
have to step back from answering tickets

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,970
every now and then and but as a

00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:51,610
developer helping out you will

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:54,590
definitely love that ultimately on a

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,270
personal level you will have lots and

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,660
lots of opportunities to practice

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:01,670
empathy empathy the experience of

00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,880
understanding another person's condition

00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:07,700
from their perspective Jeff Fowler

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,400
recently blocked that empathy is the

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,560
most important skill you can practice it

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,990
will lead to greater success personally

00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,310
and professionally and will allow you to

00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:21,710
become happier the more you practice

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:24,050
support is the perfect place to level up

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,970
empathy due to the many different people

00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,670
you're interacting with on a daily basis

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:31,450
and it turned me from a constantly

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:35,530
complaining system administrator into a

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,530
socializing friendly human being

00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,070
if you have any questions I want to keep

00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,530
in touch feel free to add me on twitter

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:49,740
or shoot me an email thank you so much

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:53,240
for your time and I hope I've put your

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,240
