Description: 
	Doctor, Lawyer, Poker Player, Physicist: The Best Engineers We're Not Competing To Hire Yet by Carina C. Zona

The team needs more engineers and we need them today. We talk about the engineer shortage.
But the problem is not what we think it is. We'll explore how hiring for only CS degrees misses exceptional opportunities.

Unconventional backgrounds breed great developers. Homogeneity boxes us in. Diverse teams are more productive, more profitable, and more excited about what they're accomplishing. Diversity isn't just demographics. It's about benefitting from distinctly varied perspectives.

Who better than the former philosopher, marine biologist, stage hand, or anthropologist?

In this talk, we'll walk through why it's worth competing for them. Forget the rock star; hire the opera singer.

yes I I will tell you that i am just

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,390
that nerdy i really do version all of my

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:33,930
recipes you have to it is useful for

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,510
everything in the universe so as Rachel

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,090
said doctor lawyer physicist poker

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,629
player these are all engineers that I

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:48,059
actually know so this isn't a bit of

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:51,360
humor we see this all the time this is

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,390
pretty standard wanted CS degree or

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,610
equivalent the thing is we need more

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,409
engineers and we need them every day and

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,680
we talk a lot about this idea of the

00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,760
engineer shortage as if it's something

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,700
uncontrollable it is how our industry is

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,190
but the problem is not what we think it

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,960
is hiring only computer scientists is

00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:14,010
missing some really exceptional

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,830
opportunities it's kind of weird because

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,460
if you don't have a CS degree how do you

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,500
know if you have the equivalent do we

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,540
even all have the same definition I

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,600
tried searching for you know what are

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,850
the the standard curricula for a CS

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,590
program and they didn't have much

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,570
agreement among themselves so I have a

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,880
feeling that as recruiters were probably

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,940
also going to be really undecided about

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,580
what we mean by that a big problem is

00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,710
who gets filtered out of that if you

00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,080
think you have to be equivalent that's a

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,820
pretty high standard do you have four

00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,120
years of just learning your butt off I

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,190
don't know it's hard because if you

00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,560
don't have a sense of truly what's being

00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,480
expected it's really easy to just say

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,680
that's not me and never even apply in

00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,890
the first place and that's one of the

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,030
ways we really lose people and the

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,400
bigger question the one I want to

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,560
address is does it even get us what we

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,209
need do we need everyone on the team to

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,470
be a computer scientist is that actually

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:15,900
healthy for the team if you're in Ruby

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,319
you know that Jim wyrick recently passed

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,140
away he was pretty beloved he was kind

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,980
of known as our our teacher in chief and

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:30,270
ironically as CS teacher because he

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,410
himself did not have a CS degree he was

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,860
the creator of

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:39,300
which is the most popular gem he also

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,400
co-created rubygems itself and has had

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,430
the most downloads from Ruby gems of

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,620
anything and like I said he didn't have

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,380
his computer science stick background so

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,940
if people were doing this back when he

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,830
got started would he have ever gotten

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,290
started who would have taken the risk of

00:02:52,830 --> 00:03:00,270
hiring him in the first place what would

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:02,250
we have lost instead we had somebody who

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,910
contributed for decades to making the

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,370
rest of us much better and I really love

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,620
this bit of sense of humor here he he

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,110
recently had I think it was in Mavericks

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,720
as recently as that Ethel started

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,520
including rake by default so he enjoyed

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,560
going to apple stores and just getting

00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,210
to see it's it's still there on all the

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,580
boxes there are so many other people

00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,760
that we admire tremendously they also

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,120
don't have CS degrees Uncle Bob Martin

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,180
John velocities one of the gang of four

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,040
yawn lenhart the creator of CouchDB

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,730
Jacob Kaplan Moss the creator of Django

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,520
all of them have no sense of even what

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,020
the equivalent is and it was interesting

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,970
I had a discussion the other day with

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,430
yon and Jacob and they both described

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,470
themselves as without modesty very

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,720
average programmers they've created

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,820
something exceptional and lasting and

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,200
that we all used every day and yet they

00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,000
don't consider themselves very good

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,500
programmers at all and they don't have a

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,630
sense of what's a baseline to compare

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,940
yourself to would we call themselves

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,790
exceptional would we call them average I

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,110
don't know but with they were applying

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,270
for jobs today what if they were

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,140
starting out would they would they want

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:20,359
to would they feel qualified to then we

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,359
do this other fun thing wanted rock star

00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:28,280
that's a rock star we want him

00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:36,029
that's a rock star that's probably one

00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,889
we mean though right yeah I don't want

00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:41,369
these people on my team I definitely

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,559
don't want them touching code and you

00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:45,209
know you hear all the time like oh like

00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:51,629
we joke right but no one actually does

00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:59,069
that it's come on whoever says that all

00:04:51,629 --> 00:05:01,159
the time then just rock stars gurus I

00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:03,659
don't even know how a guru applies here

00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:07,709
but for some reason that's another

00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:09,449
popular one so instead of recruiting a

00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,369
rock star what if we recruited some

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,459
other kind of musician someone who is

00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:18,419
less self destructive in less in need of

00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:20,159
everyone's adulation here we have

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,539
someone who has a degree in music and

00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,999
I'd like to quote some of the things

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,549
that they had to say I spent a lot of

00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:28,289
course work on linguistics to the

00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:29,849
applicability of the study of language

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:32,639
and how humans use it is straightforward

00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:34,559
I work with a bunch of languages and a

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,959
bunch of humans with particular ways of

00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:39,179
using it as a person who will always

00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,309
struggle with perfectionism I was very

00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:42,649
lucky that my first programming job was

00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:45,659
at a shop that lived and breathed

00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:47,189
extreme programming I learned first how

00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:49,589
to stop getting carried away with my own

00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:51,019
designs than how to stop start being

00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,279
disciplined about what was really needed

00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:57,479
and doesn't that sound a lot like what

00:05:53,279 --> 00:06:01,759
we do in coding as well that's someone

00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,759
who has been a team lead for 15 years

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,770
this person is a former technical

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,080
director for a 100 year old opera house

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,920
that had 60 to 90 shows come through

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,750
every year all of hers then a while ago

00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,300
she says I was convinced that I was

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,360
going to be a chef instead I went as far

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,670
as going to cooking school all of my

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,330
career's organized teams of people they

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:33,370
have a spree decor and an egalitarian

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,500
blue-collar fairness about them and all

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,540
within a staggeringly high pressure

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,320
environment where you have to deliver

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,330
something on time no matter what it may

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,700
be a plate that has to go out to a diner

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,669
or it may be a curtain it has to go up

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,400
at 8pm sharp whatever it is that's the

00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:57,840
job there's lots of organizing of people

00:06:51,400 --> 00:07:01,080
schedules resources senior software dev

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,080
18 years

00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:10,629
call center operations I'm not sure

00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:12,849
whether that translates very well but

00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,860
you know that person that you call the

00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,389
helpdesk and it's a verb least someone

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,069
who has a horrible script that they have

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,839
to read from and you know that they'd

00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:21,459
rather die than read it again but it's

00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,579
just what they required to do by their

00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:26,949
horrible horrible employee-employer so

00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:28,059
that's what this job is I think it's

00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,829
interesting that they also have a degree

00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:33,819
in psychology because that sounds like a

00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:35,849
really good complement to that job so

00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,839
retail call centers can be very toxic

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:39,519
environments they're more about damage

00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,489
control and keeping customers in line

00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,769
than really helping people I have

00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:47,559
broader perspective now on product and

00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:49,899
software impact such as direct contact

00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:53,259
with customers vendors internal IT

00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:54,729
executives we often forget that

00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:56,889
understanding how to use a particular

00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:59,289
programming language is just an

00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,239
implementation detail once you have a

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,909
grasp of the basics of the language and

00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:06,309
the communities best practices then

00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:07,899
actual coding is often the least

00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:14,439
important part of making a project

00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:16,479
successful I think we all really have a

00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,149
sense that yeah coding is analytical

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,129
right there's a lot of different fields

00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:23,669
in which you got those same skills and

00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:25,959
really can bring something to the table

00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,939
oceanographer says I apply scientific

00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,919
approach all the time collecting data

00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:32,529
comparing data to existing models

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,539
creating entirely new models finding

00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:41,879
situations where existing models became

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:41,879
insufficient 12 years

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,160
or biochemist this starts to get less

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,950
and less sounding like programming right

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,570
PhD in computational bio chemistry it

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,460
turns out that computational bio in

00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,970
chemistry is the exploration of

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,500
chemistry by using computer simulations

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,030
so actually inherent to this job is

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,620
indeed using computers and programming

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,560
quite a bit but not in the way that

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,300
probably most the people in the room do

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,730
when I find a difficult bug I apply the

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,260
scientific method and debugging it this

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,730
approach has helped me resolve issues

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,910
that other developers had thought were

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,370
too hard or were beyond them or needed

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,380
to just be ignored or worked around it's

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,180
also helped me make real improvements to

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:30,760
the performance of a number of projects

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:33,100
that I've been involved with you

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:38,410
probably notice who the person is he

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:41,010
spoke earlier molecular biology and

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,270
again computational bio chemistry I

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,250
developed an expertise in regular

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,410
expressions from scripting interchange

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,020
of formats in Perl for computational

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,240
biology you learn analytical thought and

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,490
the ability to define and solve problems

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,350
it's all very important also how to

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,540
quickly assimilate massive amounts of

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:02,430
information and make sense of it these

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,430
are all skills that we use constantly

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,290
I think this one kind of gets

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,780
underestimated when we're hiring that we

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,610
want someone with a work ethics and it's

00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,400
sort of antithetical to that idea of

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,220
let's hire a rock star rock stars really

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:30,630
don't have a work ethic they have an

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:33,700
admirer me ethic police officer 18 years

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,730
degree in Japanese which is very handy

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,960
because this person works with Ruby

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,580
being a police officer is serving the

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,040
community in a variety of roles that

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,710
required hard work of me dedication

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,720
maturity to accomplish following through

00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,880
with work from start to finish from

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,220
arrests and investigations to court

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,470
testimony both of those careers have

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,380
required a lot of organization maturity

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,170
management problem solving working under

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,720
stress deadlines critical thinking and

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:11,920
learning to accomplish a task with what

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:16,120
you have on hand that's it notice brand

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:22,350
new the field how many people do pair

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:25,120
programming oh this I like this vote

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:29,920
yeah I come from San Francisco where

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,800
practically mandatory there's a whole

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,830
cult kind of built up around it so

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,240
there's a real sense of collaboration

00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,400
this is something i wouldn't expect is a

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,800
highly applicable skilled programming

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,710
but learning weaving at a deep technical

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,450
level was so satisfying to me I think my

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,670
design education has been incredibly

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,290
useful to me in my tech work thinking

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,300
deeply about problems that need to be

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,430
solved the goals of what you're trying

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,310
to create and the end-users thinking

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,050
about what you are making and how that

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,120
will affect them all these are skills

00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,040
that I use as a developer it also

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,870
provided a lot of practice communicating

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,300
abstract ideas to other people and

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,550
defending my opinion which is basically

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,420
the critique format of fine arts schools

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:16,330
at all being able to do code review

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,840
being able to handle it I like that

00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,840
person

00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:35,110
physical chemistry it takes a ridiculous

00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:37,839
amount of persistence and commitment to

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,180
that goal of earning a PhD as a

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,860
developer I apply that scientific method

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,170
of hypothesis data collection

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,600
conclusions to every problem I am

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,269
attempting to solve the analytical mind

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,860
transfers to development so well when I

00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,750
don't know how to fix things as a

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,510
scientist I research in all the places

00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,579
that I can find until I find the

00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,170
information I need as a developer I

00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:01,000
employ similar tactics when

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,339
troubleshooting an error learning a new

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,899
technique I often had to give

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,029
presentations about my scientific

00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:09,220
research so I've become less afraid to

00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,410
tell other developers about things that

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,380
I've learned are too provo's talks for

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,149
developer conferences I think this one

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,339
is particularly interesting because life

00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,920
not only had a PhD but she was spending

00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,690
years actually being a professor and to

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,339
walk away from all that I think is

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,620
someone you really want to hire someone

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:29,170
who's so committed to leaving that much

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,910
work and that much professional cred

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:36,339
behind in order to start completely from

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:38,019
scratch as an intern coding I like this

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:40,329
idea of archaeologists and I want to

00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:42,399
find an actual archaeologist to talk to

00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:45,220
but we dig around in code all the time

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,800
dusty musty old code and try to figure

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,420
out what the hell it means and hoping

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,920
somewhere there's a civilization that

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,920
can provide context for it

00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:59,920
unconventional backgrounds really breed

00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:03,190
great developers it's majin entity that

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,459
boxes us in diverse teams are more

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,680
profitable they're more successful

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:12,579
productive they're more excited about

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,800
what they're doing diversity has a lot

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:16,930
more to do with just demographics we

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,339
tend to think of diversity as we need to

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,680
have a woman we need to have some sort

00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:23,380
of racial minority great we're done we

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,510
got diversity but it's not just

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:29,230
demographics it's about benefiting from

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:33,250
distinctly varied perspectives this is

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,380
not diversity one voice is not diversity

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,839
it's one person who's disrupting a

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,430
really nice comfortable rut that we've

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,910
gotten into and that we call culture fit

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,710
think is the art of everyone just going

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,410
along with what you think everyone else

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,970
wants and so you never actually express

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,070
your own opinion because it shouldn't

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,670
matter the culture has already decided

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:59,160
what's best groupthink means to be

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,290
disrupted we have to break out of it

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,899
healthy teams cultivate diversity

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:08,490
because disruption and discomfort is the

00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:11,640
point this is what diversity looks like

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,070
it's much messier and it varies on far

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,660
more than one axis there's nothing here

00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:21,420
where you can just say like oh that's

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:22,980
the one we've added the one so why do we

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,600
want diversity at all why is this

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,820
important I think there's a tendency to

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,230
think of it as that rubber stamp you

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,370
know someone told us that we need

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:34,200
diversity so let's tack that on so

00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,899
here's a lawyer who is in practice for

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,850
seven years law and programming both

00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,320
involve organizing data and most

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,450
importantly it's been incredibly helpful

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,130
as a programmer to have had that decade

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,770
of training and his experience as an

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:49,410
attorney it gave me evaluation of

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,150
evidence and relevance debugging just

00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,680
like parsing a legal argument is all

00:15:51,150 --> 00:16:03,660
about gathering and learning from

00:15:52,680 --> 00:16:05,580
evidence culture fit the reason we like

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,580
culture fit is because what we're really

00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:11,100
saying is no one has to change but

00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,959
someone else enters we're very confident

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,640
that nothing will change and that means

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,150
we don't have to deal with conflict and

00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,130
that feels really nice to know that you

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,260
know we're not going to fight we're not

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,540
going to wonder and be uneasy about what

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:28,260
are you doing here why you coming up

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,790
with this we need to be able to have

00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,410
those discussions we need to have people

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,880
in the room who come out things from a

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,310
completely different direction and

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,250
challenge and push and ask why are we

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:40,350
doing it this way in a completely naive

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,029
sense is sometimes the best way to ask a

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,550
question with a sling no knowledge of

00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:46,320
why the answer originally was done this

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,870
way and be able to look at an idea

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,810
completely fresh that's where discomfort

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,519
for us is getting a better product in

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:57,050
the end for the users

00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,880
we're always trying to put concepts into

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,699
practice but sometimes it's those

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,959
newbies who are the best able to do that

00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:04,850
he says what people who have used

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,410
computer science but not studied it

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,780
formally bring to the table is

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:12,110
experience putting concepts into

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,480
practice we should want diversity

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:17,299
because it's profitable it increases

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,160
sales it increases revenue and increases

00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:21,919
profitability this has been studied for

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,569
decades there's money to be had and

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,490
having people in the room who challenged

00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:34,190
us period there's been some really

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:37,490
interesting research if you divide up

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,140
teams with one having an expert and one

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,660
having just you know ordinary mult

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,580
mortals on it and give them a task

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,559
they'll come away and they'll bow

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:49,760
through their thing come back and the

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:53,390
team that had the expert comes back with

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,000
actually the poorer less creative less

00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:58,549
innovative had a hard time

00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,919
problem-solving result whereas the team

00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:03,020
that had nothing but average people did

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,120
a better job because they didn't have an

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,710
expert to defer to they didn't have the

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,299
one right answer they actually had to

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,790
think through the problem and solve it

00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:13,460
together now where it gets really

00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,470
interesting is both those groups think

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,970
wrongly about their process the group of

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,970
the expert is really proud of themselves

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,230
and they figured they did a great job

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,790
they were really productive really

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,679
creative really came up with just the

00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,299
best answer and such people who were

00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:27,559
just the average developers who come

00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:29,809
back and feel really disappointed

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,610
themselves because clearly having the

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:34,340
expert was going to you know make an

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:37,370
automatic win so on the one hand we have

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,669
this problem of limiting our ability to

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:45,650
have a productive team by putting a rock

00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:47,690
star on it but also how that affects the

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,040
dynamic in the room if there are people

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,260
who are working on different projects

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,760
and they believe that one project is

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,419
always going to be favored because it's

00:18:52,760 --> 00:19:00,020
got the golden boy then everyone is is

00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:02,390
having resentment or confusion or really

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,030
having the sense of what am I doing here

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,710
you know if I'm on the team that's never

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,179
actually going to accomplish anything or

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,919
you know what we built in

00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,830
going to be used why do I need to put in

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:17,889
the effort I might as well just you know

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:21,950
wait till the end of the day rock stars

00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:24,860
they suppress as much as groupthink any

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,809
sort of real discussion anytime you're

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,299
deferring to the one person the room who

00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:31,070
you're sure is expert you never get to

00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:33,679
hear any other opinion any other

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:36,019
viewpoint have anything challenged at

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,200
all that means that there's a whole lot

00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:41,539
of ideas that get squelched deliberately

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,100
personally voluntarily it's not like

00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:45,769
someone you know a rock star is saying

00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:48,919
like you do not talk although it's a

00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:50,480
rock star so that could happen but it

00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,700
really has much more to do with people's

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,919
own self censorship not wanting to look

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,809
like a fool and so you end up with a

00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,419
room full of people who look like

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,619
they've agreed and they haven't but they

00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:04,039
haven't spoken up about that

00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:05,480
disagreement when you take that rock

00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,490
star off the team were never added in

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,110
the first place you get that variance

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,820
that those difference is actually aired

00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,740
and they have to be evaluated and

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,929
compared because there's no one that's

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,470
obviously the right answer they have to

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:21,019
actually think it through so we've got

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:25,159
this paradox that I talked about earlier

00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:27,919
of actual effectiveness versus the leaf

00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,629
and how effective you were and the fact

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,980
that it's reverse means it's really hard

00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,990
to have self evaluate our own

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,360
performance but externally someone

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,309
should because the teams that we think

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:42,100
are not productive may very well be the

00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:42,100
ones that are most useful to the project

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:48,980
yes there is value in optimizing at

00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,379
research says joshua algorithms we can

00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,330
optimize them to death but most often it

00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:55,759
is valuable to know whether or not you

00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:58,639
even want to use a tree search algorithm

00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,490
in a given situation I leave it to the

00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:03,619
reader to figure out which skill set is

00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,139
more important for a business trying to

00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:11,019
get off the ground building a technology

00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:12,980
based product or service Leon cursing is

00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,259
pretty well known in the Ruby community

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,909
he's also known as Ruby Buddha he has a

00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:19,820
great deal of philosophy to share with

00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:21,799
the world but I'll read you some to be

00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,470
accepting of others you must accept

00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:27,649
self as someone that is not complete due

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,659
to lack of exposure to find ourselves we

00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:32,749
must be willing to seek out that which

00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:35,840
we don't understand that which we fear

00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:38,539
and we need to embrace it only then can

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,909
we know where we stand in contrast to it

00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:44,570
there and our differences become the

00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:47,480
glue that bind us together art history

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:50,450
philosophy these are my favorite tools

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,309
when solving problems I think the party

00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,529
forgets to mention is he's very

00:21:52,309 --> 00:22:06,169
charismatic on stage he obviously picked

00:21:54,529 --> 00:22:08,450
up a little something in his ears oops

00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:11,720
go back so we need to crave that

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,090
disruption hey treated early we need to

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,399
hire for radically crazy and plausibly

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,649
different people peoples who back whose

00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:20,779
background we would never seek out it's

00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:22,249
exactly who we should seek out and we

00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:24,109
should make sure our recruiters are too

00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:26,179
that they're taking away those filters

00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:28,609
let's say don't even knock on the door

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:30,590
don't even submit your cv because you're

00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:32,659
probably not at all what we're looking

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,159
for and you don't have the right degrees

00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:36,169
you don't have the right background you

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,669
don't have the right perspective the

00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:45,190
fact that they don't is what makes them

00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:45,190
perfect you want them in the room thank

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:04,450
questions hi so how would you convince

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,880
like the software company you're

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,740
applying for if you don't have a degree

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,510
that they're looking for how do you

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,029
convince them that like you are the one

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,799
that they're looking for I'm going to

00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:16,690
give a couple of answers to that one if

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,580
they really have a hard time being

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,990
persuaded it's possible that they're not

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,730
the right company to work with because

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,370
if they need to be persuaded to even

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,840
entertain an interview with you then

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,490
they may also have a really hard time

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,940
integrating you into the company i may

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:35,169
not really see your value that said i

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,529
really think there's a lot of value in

00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:40,029
doing project interviews or pairing

00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:41,919
interviews rather than talking about

00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:44,049
what have you done in the past or what

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,940
kind of education do you have to say

00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:48,820
let's sit down and work on a small

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,039
project for a couple of hours half a day

00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,720
have you come in do it at home whatever

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,820
it is that the company wants to do but

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,649
demonstrate actual skills rather than

00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,750
demonstrate something that really is

00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:00,669
only on a piece of paper and that's

00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,590
testing for everyone a lot better how

00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:05,289
this person would do at the actual work

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,610
that we do on the job every day did that

00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:07,899
answer all of it because I can come up

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:10,529
with several more answers if you need

00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:10,529
okay

00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,430
actually i'll add something to that

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,440
answer be careful of companies that want

00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,630
you to do that all day on a project that

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,980
they've already built that's exploiting

00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:30,080
the labor force all right who else do we

00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,690
have you I thought okay how would you

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,720
help a team of let's say classical

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:38,150
developers to adapt and step out of the

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,420
comfort zone and and and include people

00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,590
with such profiles in into the

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,590
interdisciplinary development team yeah

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,780
I think Joshua really raised a good

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:51,440
point about do that early at the startup

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:53,630
phase culture really cements and a

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,850
company around as video with six people

00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,460
so you really have to start early stage

00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,080
with the idea of this is how we are this

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,390
is what we do this is how we're always

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,190
going to hire we you know we're going to

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,800
be able to tolerate the

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,300
uncomfortableness of that and that's

00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,680
hard for a start-up I'm it's really hard

00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,330
because you've got all sorts of other

00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,730
things that are challenging and it's

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:17,600
really tempting to take out that one

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:19,760
it's something that you can take off but

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,460
you know in the long run if the point is

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,860
to be profitable and big and usually for

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,890
a start-up it is right then this is a

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:31,400
necessary part of that process for large

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,750
companies it is so much harder there's

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,580
an interesting trade-off though when you

00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,410
get to a company that's enormous because

00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,050
then they have this HR department and

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,510
they have at least in America as TM

00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:44,720
elsewhere HR laws that are telling them

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,880
you need to foster diversity they might

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,480
have helped some lawsuits or they have

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,850
internal groups saying you know we need

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,190
more people who are like us right now

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,980
we're a minority in this this company

00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:59,480
and we need to be seeking out more so

00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,880
you get various initiatives when the

00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,080
company is really large and you have an

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,120
opportunity when they're really small

00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,100
the hard part is when they're that

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,680
whatever medium sized you know would be

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,880
maybe up to a couple hundred people

00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:14,270
which doesn't sell medium to meet with

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,400
others say I think I think you have to

00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,860
have support from above you have to do

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,650
that sales pitch and come with the

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,540
research there's tons out there and I'd

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,940
be happy to share some with you but this

00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,380
is this is stuff that's for decades it's

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,190
been researched there is no doubt that

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,129
this is

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:33,139
more productive it's just more matter of

00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:35,509
how do you convince someone of something

00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:37,700
they believed isn't true and you know

00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:39,259
that's that's the battle and I can't

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,269
really give you an answer to that one I

00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:43,820
think it really becomes a sales pitch

00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:45,649
and someone that you have to trust will

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,110
entertain that I mean that goes back to

00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:50,690
his question of if you have to work

00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:53,149
really hard to convince the company to

00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,710
do something that's profitable and in

00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:57,289
the long run really healthy for the

00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:02,779
organization then you probably should be

00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:07,940
rethinking talking to them at all um how

00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:09,350
do you think so oh thank you so in a

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,690
start of a small organization where you

00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:13,850
don't get a large amount of incoming

00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:17,149
cv's necessarily but we'll be looking

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:19,399
for people how do you because it's it's

00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:21,470
really hard to find those people because

00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:24,259
they are not at the typical places or

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,610
that they're really hard to find how

00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:27,470
would you go about that find these

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,240
people in a smaller setting you raise a

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,129
really good point which is for a

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,080
tremendous number of companies we're

00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:34,940
essentially hiring entirely based on

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,679
network so you know someone who's

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,320
working there someone who's a colleague

00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,320
is saying i have a friend who'd be great

00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,360
for this so we don't really get that

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,840
chance to recruit externally for people

00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,480
who who should hear and i think that is

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,240
going back to your question about how do

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,370
you how do you build that there have to

00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,860
be decisions about when we recruit we

00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,450
will we will consider people who come

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,899
with a personal recommendation but our

00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,730
process is that we also open things up

00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:06,409
to external recruiting and that we're

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,289
going to go out to other people and say

00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:13,159
please tell us where we can find someone

00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:15,110
there is i apologize because my

00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,210
knowledge is really limited to the US

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,070
but in the past two years there's been a

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:23,210
ton of boot camps that have sprung up

00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:24,950
which are intended to be sort of a very

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:28,250
quick substitute for a certain amount of

00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:31,279
cs training so they range from six weeks

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:34,190
to 12 weeks in which people who are

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,080
often times already working in some sort

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,230
of unrelated field and really want to

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,010
make a quick jump into engineering take

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:45,120
these very intensive

00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:47,520
80 hour a week 80 hour yeah for several

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,700
weeks and do this immersion stuff and

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,410
come out and there are at this point so

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,780
many boot camps I think it's well over a

00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,550
hundred that they've actually reached a

00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,290
saturation point where it's hard for

00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,300
them to find jobs for all those

00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,010
graduates but it also means it's an

00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,260
opportunity because there are all those

00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:06,210
people who are newly minted who actually

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,830
have been given a really good foundation

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,110
they're not ready and I'm in a way to be

00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,400
you know certainly not seniors and some

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,900
of them are ready to be juniors some of

00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,910
them aren't but it means you can for

00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,520
instance have a fantastic intern that

00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,590
you can train to fit so well into how

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,120
you guys develop and that that can be

00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,680
really great and even though i just

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:33,360
spoke against the explosion explosion

00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:34,260
interns cost less yeah I I I think I

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,700
might have forgotten some of your

00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:40,590
questions so repeat it for me yes

00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,970
specifically as a start of a small team

00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,800
where you hire from network but even

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,620
when ya looking for those people I mean

00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,630
boot camps our one chance but what I

00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,000
mean yeah sometimes that meet up

00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,950
somebody may come there that might be

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,470
interested that's like very very few

00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,000
people yeah so when you're at the point

00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,950
where you get like a bigger company who

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,810
gets a lot of CVS and lots of different

00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,150
people coming in but as a small team

00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,590
that's just its network or you're going

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:06,390
out and talking to people and then

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,820
there's it's really hard to find an

00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,350
archaeologist who is now in archaeology

00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,820
and has done some coding on the side

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,580
don't forget all these are real people

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,010
no no that's totally fine but but as a

00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,440
small team like yeah they apply to you

00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:21,720
that's relatively easy to pick them that

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,280
but yeah I'm gonna find that person yeah

00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,570
it's there's a very limited set of

00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,950
wishes that you can go into some of it

00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,330
some of it you actually I mean make sure

00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,830
that you're doing a job posting it's

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,840
amazing how many companies are never

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,640
externally announcing that there's an

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,160
opening at all or another thing we do is

00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,870
we don't have any openings but we hire

00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,510
people who you know we just think are

00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:45,120
great and so you get where there never

00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,550
was a job open in the first place it was

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,500
just someone from the network or someone

00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,970
who was admired enough that someone just

00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,380
said green light we want to have this

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,200
person the company will figure out later

00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,470
what their job is

00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,960
so that that is a real barrier so make

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,780
sure that you are actually putting word

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,400
out to public sources I've seen a

00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,140
tremendous number of companies higher

00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,670
and higher and higher without having put

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:14,160
anything on their careers page at all a

00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:17,070
friend had they were having problems

00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,600
getting resumes in general and they were

00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,190
particularly bothered by the fact that

00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,290
they weren't getting any women applying

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,940
and she said well let me take a look at

00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:27,240
this job posting and she just started

00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,250
crossing things out including CS just

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,290
framing it differently really and she

00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,820
said overnight they started getting

00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,500
twenty percent of the resumes were

00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:37,050
suddenly from women and they've had none

00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,520
just by changing the phrasing to really

00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,590
open up the idea of this is what we're

00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,140
looking for some of the the best

00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,520
postings I've set seeing aren't so much

00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,640
talking about what tools do you know

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,650
because tools can be taught your life

00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,740
experience is so much harder to be

00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:55,140
taught and takes way more time so having

00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,730
more phrasing it's talking about what

00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,890
kind of perspective we're interested in

00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:01,470
and being open to all the different ways

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,460
that that perspective could come that

00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,810
may be something you got through

00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,820
education may have been something that

00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,800
you got through self education may be

00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,740
something that was endowed to you by

00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,740
life itself but being able to to

00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,210
identify more what kind of mind do we

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,310
want in this company and then being

00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,470
really clear when we put it out there

00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:22,290
that this is what we're hiring for is

00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,240
his mind and if necessary we are more

00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:29,330
than happy to train you on our toolkit

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:34,910
you know that's that's easier to do that

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:37,650
ants or more the question all right hi

00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:39,360
thank you hi there's an incredibly

00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:43,860
bright light that's blocking my view of

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:47,130
everybody I don't really have a question

00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,740
I just want to add something I'm in

00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:53,940
higher education here in Austria and I

00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:56,910
think turning archaeologists into web

00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:00,090
developers isn't all that easy and what

00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:03,000
we really need is more offers like the

00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,670
boot camps you mentioned I don't know of

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,410
any boot camps we have here locally

00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:11,580
maybe somebody would like to

00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:13,620
sarsem I think they're very affable in

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:18,150
there quite American and being quite

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:22,620
expensive and in the beginning I think

00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:25,230
we should what we can offer now is in

00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,120
Austria we've only switched over to the

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,460
bachelor and master system about 10

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,260
years ago so we used to have five years

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,480
of study and you get a masters degree

00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,060
and now we have three years of study

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,680
think you can switch over to something

00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,750
else and do your masters in something

00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,480
different and I think this is an

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,880
opportunity for people to change the

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,540
path of their career that hasn't really

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,430
been realized by by people here so you

00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,980
can after you after doing your

00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:55,230
bachelor's in archaeology and or after

00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:59,280
doing your bachelor's as a lawyer you

00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:01,380
can decide to switch tracks and you know

00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:05,040
get a masters in web development with me

00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,300
in Salzburg just saying that's actually

00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,419
that's really interesting to me because

00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:12,600
I in America I've the freedom to change

00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:14,429
my major every single semester so it's

00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,130
interesting to hear that you can't do

00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:19,020
that as easily I've changed careers many

00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,240
times i'm not sure what number I could

00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,690
put on that and that's certainly true of

00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,830
a lot of people that i spoke to as well

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,720
the fact that that would be really

00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,550
challenging and it's just starting to be

00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,590
made it easier is is really an

00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:34,040
interesting discussion to have and i

00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:37,110
would love to talk to you later about it

00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,929
career change a lot of these people I

00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:42,480
mean kind of by definition what we're

00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:46,080
describing had to be career changers so

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,640
how do you find those people in some

00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,770
respects if we start to go back to

00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,870
identifying what kind of mine do we want

00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,570
then we can identify some place where

00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:56,250
those mines hang out and you know do

00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,410
things like say I would like to give a

00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,650
presentation about such and such would

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:03,660
you folks be interested in that another

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,400
thing that is very effective is to make

00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,740
individual invites and this is something

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,540
that works in many contexts if you want

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:12,570
someone to volunteer ask them

00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,670
person-to-person you get a much higher

00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,680
result if you want someone to propose to

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,440
a conference ask them personally to

00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,210
propose you get much higher numbers and

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,030
if you want some lunch

00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:26,400
life or a job you can identify them and

00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,440
just say hey I think you know you would

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,540
be a great choice than our company think

00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,450
about applying I would be happy to you

00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:35,660
know add my recommendation to it those

00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,880
kinds of things put it on the individual

00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,010
so you know there's that question of why

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,250
should individuals be taking on kind of

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,420
the company's responsibility but that's

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,330
one of the ways we can be part of that

00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:51,450
cultural change which your question

00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:53,339
again you know we can be an internal

00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,920
advocate or we can also externally be

00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,790
doing some of that work ourselves

00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,000
actually that doesn't have to be an or

00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:03,960
that can be an end okay I think we have

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:10,910
time for just one more questions are we

00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:10,910
