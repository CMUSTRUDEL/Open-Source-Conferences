Title: Kod.io 2014 - Continuous Translation: I18n in Agile Projects by Burak Yiğit Kaya
Publication date: 2020-01-24
Playlist: Kod.io 2014
Description: 
	Translations or rather internationalization in projects are usually a "post-release" step and managing them was always quite a burden:
string freeze → extract those strings → send strings out (or put them in a DB) → wait for translations to come in → get the translations in the app → release.

If you notice errors in your translations, rinse & repeat, GLHF.

In this talk you'll see a new approach that will make you stop worrying about translations and have them as a part of your CI stack.

Burak will be sharing the journey and machinery behind getting the distributed social network Disqus available in more than 28 languages and counting, without hampering their development speed and daily deploys.
