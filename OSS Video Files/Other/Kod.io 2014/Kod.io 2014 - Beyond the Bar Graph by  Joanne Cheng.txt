Description: 
	Turning set of numbers into a simple graph can instantly tell us a story about data. However, there are times when a standard graph isn't enough.
Sometimes we need to search for alternate ways to visualize our data so we can communicate with users better.

In this talk, we'll be looking at different data sets and the standard ways of representing them using as bar graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots.

We'll then explore less common, creative, and unique ways of visualizing the same data sets and the reasoning behind the graphics we create.

We'll be utilizing two popular JavaScript libraries for data visualization: highcharts.js and d3.js, and talk about the benefits of each library from a design and developer viewpoint.
