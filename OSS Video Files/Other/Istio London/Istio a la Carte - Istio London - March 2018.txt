	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,319
so I've been a product manager at Google

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,359
for about five years and I've spent that

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,849
entire time working with the team that

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,130
builds our API and service serving

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,960
infrastructure and someone asked me

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,219
recently is that get is that a little

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,870
boring you're ready to move on and

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,340
Google people do tend to move around

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,189
work on different projects that

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,420
certainly can't stay on one and I said

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,859
actually you know it's kind of funny

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,050
because in the five years I've been

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,029
there everything about it has changed

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,460
and not only as Google really started

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,320
focusing externally and you know Google

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,480
focusing on cloud but all of the

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,070
technology has changed entirely so I've

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,780
been doing this now for five years I'm

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,190
finally starting to understand it even

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,670
as the technology changes out from

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,660
underneath so I can answer you know hang

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,539
out and can answer general questions

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:51,510
about about sto at the end and by the

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,309
way this team that built that that is

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,230
the API and service build infrastructure

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,449
team at Google they built all the stuff

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,539
that serves all the api's you know all

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,340
the internal services you know it serves

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,619
the Maps API as it serves all the cloud

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,570
API is Drive YouTube Gmail all those

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,280
they then about two or three years ago

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,409
we started focusing on external products

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,450
and after the first open source project

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,060
we did with GRP see how many people know

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,680
what G RPC is how many people using G

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,970
RPC oh it surprises me yeah that's great

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,680
we have a commercial product called

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,390
Google Cloud endpoints we bought a

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,360
little company called apogee about a

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,240
year and a half ago and and then the

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,210
latest about a year ago announced eesti

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,350
oh so I want to start with where we are

00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:42,600
with this deal any moment now we're

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,399
gonna waft the the smell of freshly

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,130
compiled software is gonna wash over us

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,159
and and if steal zero point seven is

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:55,380
gonna be pushed so we announced we

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:58,670
started working with IBM and lyft a year

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,540
ago December and we announced last May

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,520
each do we announced the project

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,219
publicly it was in github the whole time

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,060
it was always you know started from from

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,680
line zero in github and we announced in

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,400
in May we announced version 0.1

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,480
took us about a quarter to get to 0.2

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,150
and I think after 0.3 we decided we

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,829
should move to more frequent releases so

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,950
if you get functionality out faster get

00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:29,889
get people using it and and really get

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,450
the project in better shape so since 0.3

00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:35,139
we've been doing releases every month so

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:37,420
we're up to 0.7 and about four weeks

00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:39,010
from now we should see 0.8 and we're

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,959
gonna call that a long-term support

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,299
release which means we will we will back

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,230
port bug fixes and we will do a 0.8.1

00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:49,870
point 2 etc we do have people using it

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,849
in production IBM over the weather

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,260
company which is you know I think they

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,370
they announced some numbers I think

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,530
they're doing four hundred thousand

00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,719
requests a second so it's serving some

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,609
some pretty serious volume so that's

00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:05,829
that's where we are Descartes Labs is in

00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:11,379
production namely Mattie Mattie Mattie

00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:14,620
tables his is from namely right he they

00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:16,479
went into production we have another not

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,569
a customer again but but some people we

00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,760
know in San Francisco who were very very

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,099
close so we have a few companies that

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,510
are that are using in production the

00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:30,010
question that you asked was is it

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,659
production ready you know I mean we're

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,060
not calling it 1.0 yet and when we get

00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:36,879
to 1.0 we will we want some stability in

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,069
the api's that's very important and we

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,900
do want it to be certain features that

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,939
we that we are you know we're adopting

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,069
the kubernetes you know there's there's

00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:46,900
alpha features there's beta features and

00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,000
they're stable features so we want a set

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,709
of core features stable we want a set of

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,479
test cases that we're running

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,040
reproducibly and we want to be able to

00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,989
tell you you can expect to be able to

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,930
handle you know this many requests a

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,099
second and you can expect this much CPU

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,709
consumption in it and here's the things

00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,780
that we've tested so we will declare it

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,579
production ready at that point however

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,319
it's certainly production ready for

00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,430
certain use cases right now as evidenced

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,629
by the people who are using an in

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,189
production and I think that's where I

00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,470
wanted to go with where we are right now

00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,419
so by the way we're gonna release 0.8 we

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,219
also expect to get to 1.0 in the next

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:23,260
three or four months so not too many

00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,940
monthly releases after that before we

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,720
think we're we're ready to get there

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:32,590
you're done breaking all the api's right

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,600
and we'll see so what I wanted to talk

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:39,340
to you is about three or four months ago

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,980
we went on the the sto world tour Louie

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,950
Ryan who is the the technical lead at

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,110
Google and one of the one of the

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,630
technical leads on the project Varun who

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,240
was a product manager on sto and has

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:56,080
left to start some mysterious Steel

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,880
related startup he and I the the two of

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,560
us went around to a bunch of cities

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,510
around we call it world tour although it

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,790
was mostly confined to United States in

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:07,240
northern Europe as you can see but we

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,940
talked to lots and lots of customers we

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,460
talked at meetups we went to the ISTE of

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,520
the kubernetes production user council

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,590
in London we went to you know we went to

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,410
small meetups and big meetups we went

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,090
and met panels of customers panels of

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,610
open-source users not Google customers

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,520
really tried to talk to lots and lots of

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,890
hidden potential users this was after we

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,120
had announced it so you know some people

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,740
had played with it some people were

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,680
being introduced to it but it was it was

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,200
really a chance for us to go talk to

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,850
people and and and figure out you know

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,990
what what's resonating you know it's

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,000
kind of out there people are starting to

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,860
play with it do they like it do they

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,570
need it what do they need what's wrong

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,360
what are we missing and it was a really

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,830
a chance to learn about how people were

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,150
thinking they were gonna use this and

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,830
how they were reacting the feature set

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,740
and as a product manager that's always

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,270
great because as a product manager you

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,310
want to figure out what people need and

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,440
and I like to ship software I like to

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,850
ship software as soon as possible and do

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:10,330
we have any other product managers here

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:16,480
good as a product manager the best way

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:18,010
to ship faster as to what what yeah not

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,600
to do something is to reduce scope right

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,430
and that that's exactly it fine you're

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,940
minimal define minimal as low as you can

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,440
and and and go for that so so when we

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,110
talk whenever I talk about is Tiye when

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,150
I give kind of the intro talk to what is

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,200
Sto which I didn't do tonight cuz I

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,150
figured you guys have all seen that

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,860
before I always talk about there's

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,930
really three things the food three main

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,849
you propositions of this to1 is

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,669
observability and this idea that we're

00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:46,129
gathering metrics and a standard set of

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:48,349
metrics for all your services that were

00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:51,199
gathering logs that were gathering you

00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:52,729
know telemetry and tracing some people

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,129
you know that like that's one of the big

00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:58,370
things that that it does and the second

00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:00,259
thing is is control and that's control

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,090
the ability to route a request where it

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,460
needs to go whether that's load

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,379
balancing across a pod whether it's load

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,449
balancing to a different cluster whether

00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:10,279
it's you're running a canary test right

00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:12,439
now you want certain header to go to

00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,539
test instances that ability to control

00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,159
where request goes is a really big deal

00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,319
and some people really like that and

00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:20,779
then the final one is security just the

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,370
ability to say hey we have MPLS and we

00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,599
can put an authorization policy so

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,180
strong authentication and authorization

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,159
so one of the things we did on that

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,469
world tour was kind of talk to people

00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:31,939
about this to try and suss out like you

00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:33,229
know do you need all these things is

00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:38,270
that is it you know is that what you

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:40,099
need turns out not everybody needs

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,779
everything and as a product manager

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:43,039
that's a great thing to learn right if

00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:44,960
there's things there's something that

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,250
people don't need you can cut that and

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,909
you say you know what we'll get to 1.0

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:52,849
faster so that was good to know the the

00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:55,250
frustrating thing was that in our

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:57,830
feature set there was not a silver

00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,879
bullet and even of those three if you

00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,089
just break it down to just you know

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,710
those three features there wasn't one

00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:05,120
that everybody said that's the one we

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,560
need if you have that I'll start using

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,379
it what was interesting was that nearly

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,629
every customer we talked to potential

00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,009
customer potential user said that's the

00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:18,229
one I want and they had one that they

00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:20,270
wanted and and that was kind of a really

00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:22,460
frustrating thing to learn was that for

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,629
some people observability was key right

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,250
that's all they wanted give them that

00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,979
and they'll they'll walk away it's done

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,930
they've got it for other people it's

00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,430
it's the security in finance how many

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,949
anybody here work in financial services

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,050
your thing about em TLS right and if

00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:38,329
you're not you probably aren't you know

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,269
that's just it's just the way it is and

00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:43,789
for some people it's the traffic control

00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:45,140
so so that was the the big takeaway when

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,569
I came back from that and it had been

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,770
weeks of travel and people said so what

00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,149
did you learn on that trip if I was

00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,329
gonna give him 30 seconds if I was gonna

00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:52,100
get

00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:56,179
three seconds it is there's no silver

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,860
bullet and in fact there's not just

00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:59,360
three features in this do there's a lot

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,949
of features in this tio I just stole

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,110
this from someone else's deck it's a

00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:05,119
partial list but there's a lot of stuff

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,540
that sto does right there are a ton of

00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:10,939
things that it does and in effect you've

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,559
got a menu of features in sto right

00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:17,239
there's a lot of things that it offers

00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:19,160
and and maybe to some people if you look

00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:21,439
at it right there's too many maybe this

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,809
thing is kind of a Swiss Army knife

00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:25,249
right it's it's it's got the you know

00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:26,869
you want to you want to open a bottle

00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:28,189
it's got the corkscrew you want to open

00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:29,809
the other kind of bottle it's kind of

00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:31,399
bottle opener you know you need to file

00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,989
your nails it's got that it's got blades

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,009
it's got scissors and that's great

00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,749
there's sometimes it's great but

00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,999
sometimes you can be thinking about a

00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:39,319
Swiss Army knife and what you actually

00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:41,989
end up looking at is you see something

00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:44,179
like this you think what the hell this

00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:47,989
thing is so complicated can it really by

00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:50,209
the way this is real it's like four

00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:54,079
hundred quid and it's two and a half

00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:55,549
inches deep but but that's that's the

00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:57,079
risk right is that that you think oh I

00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:58,459
don't need all of those things I just

00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:00,410
don't mean I would never buy that

00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,679
because I don't need all of those things

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,889
right and when we went to coop con or

00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:11,029
cube con depending on who you ask

00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:14,929
last year there was already a steal had

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:17,720
been around long enough to have pushback

00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:19,160
and have people say I don't know why

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,600
everyone's talking about ServiceMaster

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,860
no one's even use it in production I'm

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,089
like well of course no one's using it in

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:27,319
production it's not ready for that yet

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:28,519
right and and then the other thing

00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,929
people was saying well it's it's too

00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:34,519
complicated there's just too much right

00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:41,559
and and so the question that we started

00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:41,559
asking ourselves is is sto table d'hote

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,920
sidenote when you when you go to

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,050
California

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,180
everybody can can pronounce words in

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:55,600
Spanish we can say tortilla and we can

00:10:49,180 --> 00:11:00,400
say you know Zeebo there was a thief

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,110
yeah but but ask us to say anything in

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,340
French ask us to even approximating

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,140
anything in French we can't get close

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,140
but you know we all know what what a

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,490
tough deduct menu is right it's where

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,050
you walk in and the menu is fixed and

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,980
you don't have options it's a bunch of

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,480
stuff and you're getting all those

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,610
things right that's what the table

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,590
d'hote is and the question is is is do

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,810
table d'hote and and while you might not

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,400
realize that the answer is no we've got

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,010
a lot of components that can be used for

00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:30,030
a lot of different things however this

00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:32,380
is not a table d'hôte menu is that good

00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,880
why wouldn't you want to use it has all

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,830
those features I had that list that long

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,030
it could have made it that long why

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,820
wouldn't you want to use all those

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,350
features well the biggest thing is you

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,120
don't want to bite off more than you can

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,310
chew right when you're when you're

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,420
taking on an implementation of a new

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:50,470
project it's it's a bad thing if you're

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,090
gonna do something that's gonna add

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,470
months to your implementation no one

00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,450
wants that I don't want that to happen

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,640
to your project I want it to be as as

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,010
simple as possible and especially if you

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,940
don't need MPLS for example I don't want

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:05,940
you fighting with our RCA right it just

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,530
doesn't make any sense

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,570
it's really good when you're when you're

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,400
laying out a project to lay out good

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,800
steps steps where you're making progress

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,510
even if they're baby steps where you can

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,210
show progress along the way of a project

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,650
so maybe you intend to eventually start

00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,160
using everything that is geo has to

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:26,310
offer but it's okay to start off with

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,810
small and go step by step along the way

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,340
because you can have victories and you

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,480
can show progress and you can tell your

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,190
boss hey you know that thing it's

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,240
working we can do canary rollouts now

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,620
hooray

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,630
you know next quarter we're gonna think

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,950
about turning on MT LS but you can show

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,420
victories and that's really you know for

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,860
those of you who work any place a lot

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,540
larger than you know 10 or 15 people

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,650
it's kind of really important to be able

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,900
to do is hey yeah we did that project

00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,460
and we succeeded and now we're gonna go

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,010
on to the next step

00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,440
so what I'm here to talk to you about

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,520
tonight is the fact that sto is an ala

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,200
carte menu

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,640
and we've got that list of features you

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,070
don't need to implement them all at the

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,570
same time you can turn it on for just

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,250
the ones you need and you can implement

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,320
them over time and so what I wanted to

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,380
do and I'm not going to talk for an hour

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,470
either liam is tell you about a few use

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:14,410
cases we're in this weird situation that

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,760
we're an open source project but some of

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,560
the people who are who are in

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,750
implementations or customers of ours so

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,640
I don't actually use names for most of

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,830
these other than when people have spoken

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,060
publicly about what they're doing but

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,530
everything I'm gonna tell you here is

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,840
based on something that somebody is

00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,820
doing right now after they looked at the

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,560
feature set of Sto so I wanted to talk

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,260
to you about about these different use

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,310
cases and the different features so I

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,450
talked about those three main features

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,490
but there's a there's a bunch of

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,400
different components right we talked a

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,020
lot about envoy pilot and mixer but we

00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,490
do have a certificate authority we

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,630
talked about the initializer earlier

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,670
because what do you do when it's down

00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,010
and then of course we have the in the

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,230
ingress functionality ingress proxy and

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,730
these are actually modular and you can

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,800
actually choose which one of them's

00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,290
which ones of them you will use now I

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,900
will argue that everyone has to use

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,610
pilot and in fact that's really the

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,100
definition of if you're using is do or

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,980
not if you're using pilot you're using

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,780
it's do but you can't you cannot use

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,710
anything else you want to which is kind

00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:16,510
of crazy lots of people don't think

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:19,180
about that way so put the menu up on up

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,590
on a chart and you can see all the

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,660
different pieces in fact there's more

00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,090
pieces than I even listed there because

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,830
mixer has plugins right and we're

00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,180
shipping a bunch of plugins out of the

00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,240
box which should be an authorization

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,260
plugin something to do quota integration

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,150
with our own it's a couple of

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,070
integration with our own products that I

00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,140
don't know if we're really an

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,900
open-source at some point obviously the

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,480
Prometheus integration what's that they

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:47,020
are great yeah so um

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,540
he wrote stackdriver it's there so so

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,640
you know it's funny because there's like

00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,640
40 engineers at Google working on it at

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,690
hto or maybe 35 it's a lot but it seems

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,690
like Zack wrote all of it

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:04,689
yeah that's l5 vision right there so so

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,800
it's is pretty component I mean I'm

00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:07,240
going to show you so this is this is

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,949
what this diagram take a mental snapshot

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,319
of this everybody you can use your phone

00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,310
and take a snapshot if you want to

00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:14,410
because I'm going to refer back to this

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,850
later in some different use cases so the

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,860
first one is actually the one we

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,439
anticipated which is not everyone's

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,899
gonna want or need em TLS why not a

00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:24,279
couple of reasons one is you do have to

00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:26,170
run a certificate authority it's another

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,610
thing to make sure it's running and to

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,740
think about what happens if it's not up

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,740
and stuff starts not working

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,050
second encrypting takes CPU cycles and

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,470
depending on your workload and depending

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:40,180
on your wallet and depending on your

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,649
sensitivity to latency all of those

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,970
things might say I don't want to I don't

00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,769
want to do that I don't to pay that cost

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,899
I want to pay for that CPU I don't to

00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:48,009
pay for those microseconds and I don't

00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,809
want to pay for the hassle of running

00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:51,370
that surface so this one we actually

00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:55,029
thought of in and those of you who have

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,860
installed SEO from the site will know

00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,329
that we have basically two installation

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,240
scripts that you can run one anyone

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:03,430
installs auth and one does not so if you

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,899
don't install off it simplifies the

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,819
picture a little bit right you you're

00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,410
not installing that component at all you

00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:11,309
lose all those nice little lock icons

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:16,089
everywhere but for a lot of people

00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:17,740
everything here is is behind a you know

00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,089
it's it's it's easy on your KU Nettie's

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,399
clusters is behind the firewall

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:23,920
nothing outside can reach it and you

00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,779
don't need it and that's okay um we will

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,009
tell you at Google our best practice

00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:29,079
that we talk about is always secure

00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:31,750
everything right we run a flat network

00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:33,420
internally every single call from every

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,430
single service to another service is

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,920
strongly authenticated and authorized

00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,529
right that's a best practice you don't

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,970
have to implement that most people don't

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,079
implement that you're not doing that on

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,459
all of your other stuff that you're

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,929
running right now you don't need to

00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:48,730
start doing that just because of this do

00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:50,529
over time you might decide to do that

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,899
there's very compelling reasons to do

00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:54,220
that but you still doesn't have to be

00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:56,709
the event that makes you start doing it

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,910
so if it's easier it's okay you're still

00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:03,550
using it you don't feel bad it's alright

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,839
um another thing Descartes Labs is a my

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,919
can say out loud as I said they were the

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,750
first company to go into production

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,640
version 0.2

00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,250
and that should tell you how desperate

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,020
they were for and I don't mean that like

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,459
that wasn't a joke like really that

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,490
should tell you how desperate they were

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:21,140
for observability so they they have

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,600
pretty cool technology they take

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,850
satellite images they run machine

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,189
learning algorithms to draw really

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,960
interesting conclusions like you know

00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:33,049
crop yields and stuff like that and then

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,470
they sell access to that data they have

00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:38,419
some pretty high volume clients do I

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:41,690
keep stepping on that I'm sorry

00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:42,770
and so they had moved to kubernetes and

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,809
they were really happy with the

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,309
scalability they were really happy with

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:47,990
repeatable deployments a lot of things

00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:50,150
they really liked when their app ran

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,020
slowed they didn't know why and it was

00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,090
driving I'm crazy

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,159
and so for them to get a good dependency

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,960
graph and to be able to understand how

00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,220
much traffic on a particular service was

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,250
coming from another one of their

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,320
services that was super super critical

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,370
for them because then they could make

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,570
sure they were scaling that one

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,679
appropriately and otherwise they didn't

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,049
know how to and sometimes they could

00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,360
tune how much one of them was calling so

00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,470
for them it was worth going zero point

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,809
two which I can tell you was not

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,880
production ready for many use cases but

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:18,590
if you turned off everything and you you

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,200
know only use the mixer plug-in that was

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:23,510
doing up that was doing observability

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,830
you could get your dependency graph and

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,919
you can get those metrics in a graph on

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,539
a dashboard we sometimes use this quote

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,150
there's an actual quote from from Tim

00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:33,530
Kelton yeah everybody got fired up about

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,970
kubernetes and micro services and then

00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,789
they were like oh what's going on

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,470
and that that's that's how they felt so

00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:42,049
it's do let them find the trouble spots

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,210
so this is what they had to install now

00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:45,409
you'll notice they're still running

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,490
pilot they're still running the Envoy

00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:51,559
proxy they're just using standard

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:53,299
kubernetes ingress and the only plugins

00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,640
that they need are Prometheus and stack

00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:58,520
driver so they're they're mixer

00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,690
deployment ISM is much simpler and in

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,220
therefore it's you know it's taking less

00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,480
resource it cetera but they went they

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,620
went to production on this last I don't

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,919
know what it was like September or

00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:10,610
something perfectly valid ordered all

00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:12,380
the card off the menu next one we have

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,120
another customer who's very cannot a

00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,370
customer this is not a customer but

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,590
another company who I hope they start

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,210
talking publicly because I think it's

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,100
cool when people do that

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,370
they're just need ingress they need

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,080
better

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:28,250
ingress control on their kubernetes

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,710
cluster they have about 2,000 unique

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,000
services running on their cluster now

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,559
they don't have service to service

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,750
traffic because in fact it's

00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:37,430
multi-tenant and they have every one of

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,380
their customers has it has a service

00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,240
running essentially and so they're not

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,740
so concerned about that they don't have

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,920
traffic between their micro services

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,120
everything is from ingress to to an

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,520
individual service but there are about

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:54,200
2,000 of them all they wanted was the

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,700
was the sto ingress I guess I should

00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,170
have had some lines here because they

00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,820
are they are monitoring that of course

00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,429
and they're pushing the config through

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,190
pilot but they didn't go with sidecars

00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,890
now over time they probably will add

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,350
sidecars but as you can see this

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:13,040
significantly eases their adoption

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:15,470
throwing a sidecar I dependent if you've

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,970
done it before then you think it's just

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,500
another thing to do and it's fine you're

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,330
kind of used to the idea if you haven't

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,740
done it before you can see that it's a

00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,020
scary step to take especially if you're

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,429
running 2,000 of those things right so

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,840
the ability to say you know what we're

00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:28,040
not going to use the sidecar now if you

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,110
have services service traffic you're

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,670
really missing out on the observability

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,320
you're gonna want it but if you don't

00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,170
it's okay to do that they're using

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,600
ingress and and that's all

00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:39,140
so again perfectly valid they order all

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,640
the cart

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,559
they started now they as I said they are

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,120
gonna go to sidecar it's they want more

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,540
of these features but they decided to

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,280
pick something small ish get to know the

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:53,110
system get to get used to running it in

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,330
production and and that's what they did

00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:59,179
we have another customer who is heavy

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,880
heavy this is a customer and I'm sure

00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:04,670
that they will let us talk publicly soon

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,350
they're heavy gr PC users they have in

00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,970
there and they are where they've been

00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:12,200
developing in micro services for a long

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:15,679
time so they have about a hundred gr PC

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,140
services in their kubernetes cluster and

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,570
they're all gr PC there's a problem with

00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:22,309
gr PC and load balancing which is load

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,320
balancers most load balancers out there

00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:25,760
don't know what to do with gr PC they're

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,960
not very good at balancing what to them

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:33,380
just looks like TCP traffic right and so

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,740
this company has to stand up a l3 l4

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,150
load balancer in front of their

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,040
service because the service scales they

00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,260
need to just do plain ol l3

00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,500
load-balancing right there running a

00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:47,530
hundred of these services and they run a

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,940
test and a prod and a staging or maybe

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,890
it's a dev and a staging in a prod of

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,179
each one so they're running 300 load

00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,710
balancer another Google customer so

00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:55,780
they're paying us for those 300 load

00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,820
balancers but they're running 300 load

00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,900
balancers it's like $60,000 a year or

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,210
something they're paying for a load

00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,260
balancing it's kind of a drop in the

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,480
bucket and their bill but they don't

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,000
like spending that 300 I mean that extra

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,040
$60,000 if they could get the load

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,890
balancing the client-side load balancing

00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,420
of odd voi they can turn those down it's

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,920
gonna be like that and they install this

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,860
open source project and they're gonna

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,660
just turn all those off so for them

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,059
they're using mixer but they're not

00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,070
using authentication they're not our

00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:26,200
authorization they're not using quota

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,240
they're not using I am all they want

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,800
really they'll take the the monitoring

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,450
of course but all they wanted really is

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,340
that is the client-side load balancing

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,620
so for them they are gonna use ingress

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,929
and and they are going with the the side

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:44,170
cars but but just the ingress in the

00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:46,960
side cars and then there's what what we

00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,000
get in finance frequently and that's you

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,980
know what I have so many APM tools

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,840
already and I have engineered the crap

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,420
out of every single binary that we have

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,340
I don't need any more monitoring I don't

00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,450
understand what canary rollout means so

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,520
I don't know what you're talking about

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,950
when you say that we're deploying

00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,440
monoliths anyway I can understand that

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,150
but if I don't get authentication and

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,550
authorization on every call soon I'm

00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,660
gonna I'm gonna freak or actually

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,750
there's another really interesting case

00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:17,710
for this which is right now most people

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:19,540
use IP addresses for security and when I

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,610
say use IP addresses for security you

00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,200
use IP addresses within your network

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,850
with your corporate networks very common

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,500
you have a segment and partition right

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,390
and you can stay within this zone you

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,559
can call services but you can't call out

00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,390
to this one and in this zone they can

00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:33,220
call out so we went to a bank that

00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,850
spends we went to a bank that has more

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,760
developers than we do yeah think about

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,170
that right yeah they're their IT budget

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,670
is something like twelve billion dollars

00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,160
a year which is probably more than all

00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,020
of our IT budgets together right their

00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,179
data centers are partitioned for

00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,710
security but the

00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,149
woman is it's very difficult for them to

00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,119
change those partitions and they have

00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:56,080
some partitions that are completely

00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:57,489
oversubscribed that have more workloads

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,109
running in the year that they can't run

00:23:57,489 --> 00:24:02,529
them all and they have others that are

00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:04,330
running at 50% capacity but they cannot

00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:06,039
take workloads from over here and run

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:10,139
them in here because there's no network

00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:14,379
connectivity right they want to turn off

00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:15,909
internal partitioning and in order to do

00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:17,469
that they need something else to protect

00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:18,759
their services because you don't want to

00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:20,559
do that and lose your security you want

00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,440
to make sure only the right things can

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,389
call can call your you know can call

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,769
each service at Google as I think I said

00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:28,809
this before we run a flat network

00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:31,029
internally we don't have any internal

00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,559
partitioning it's much much better you

00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:33,759
don't have that problem of you know

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,259
you've got unused capacity over there

00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,639
but you can't take care of it so all

00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:42,549
they want is is the control is is

00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:43,690
authorization and authentication now to

00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:45,759
do this they are going to have to

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,979
install all the components but they can

00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,029
have a simplified mixer install they

00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:50,830
don't need to have that Prometheus

00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,899
adapter in there they don't need to have

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,669
quota adapters in there they don't need

00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:56,409
to you know send data to stackdriver

00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:58,899
all they're gonna do is authorization

00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:00,249
checks maybe they'll use our I am maybe

00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:02,139
they'll use their own but all they will

00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:04,599
do is authorization checks is a service

00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:06,759
when a call comes in when this when this

00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:08,200
thing goes to call this thing first of

00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:09,789
all you know it's it's MPLS so we'll

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,919
know definitively where that call is

00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:13,330
coming from and it will check to say

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,979
with the auth policy oh saying now I

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,539
know definitively who is making this

00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:18,070
call and once you know that you can make

00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:18,839
an informed decision do we allow this

00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,969
call through

00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:25,779
as an aside as I said at Google we're on

00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:27,009
a flat network any any any place on the

00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:28,779
network can call anywhere else on the

00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:32,679
network but every single call is

00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:34,210
authorized and services can only call

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:39,899
services that they have been explicitly

00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:42,820
authorized to call it vastly vastly

00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:44,440
simplifies our network topology it means

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,389
we don't have to spend as much time and

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,639
effort administering our network as you

00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:50,379
guys do which is ironic since we have a

00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:52,539
much more secure network than probably

00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:55,029
anyone here it's it's kind of crazy but

00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:57,639
by by by ensuring that every single

00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:59,109
service on the on the network is secure

00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,029
it means you don't have to use

00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:03,010
partitioning for security anymore and

00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:04,570
it's really really freeing

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,680
I don't imagine that the people in this

00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,420
room are gonna be able to go convince

00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,890
their network people hey great news you

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,330
don't have to do this anymore but over

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,500
time that is gonna happen over time I

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,520
really think that's going to start

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,350
happening and people won't do that

00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,000
anymore but the banks are starting to do

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,590
it now so when they look at it CEO ala

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,200
carte there's one thing they want and

00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:25,780
it's and it's authentic Asian and

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:27,580
authorization which is two things let me

00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,500
sum up how I meant to put a big Sigma on

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,020
here do you mind if I finish my slides

00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:36,940
real quick no there is no time let me

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:39,040
speak it's not table d'hote and we want

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,350
to do some things to to make this easier

00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,750
I would love to I don't know put this up

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,520
on the website so people know it we'd

00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,320
like that it would be really good if we

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,760
really get some time and maybe some of

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,830
our dev rail friends could help us with

00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,200
some more install scripts say oh if all

00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,030
you want is off here's the install

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,500
script you want you know if all you want

00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,790
is monitoring here's the install script

00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,830
well we'll probably get there eventually

00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:04,630
or maybe other people will you know you

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:05,410
guys you know PR is welcome but we want

00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,060
to make it easy through our

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,440
documentation and and through the

00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,880
scripts to make it clear you don't have

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,290
to turn this on it's it's not that

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,970
daunting as a system there's seven

00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,410
running components but to some people

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,640
it's a big deal and especially if you

00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,500
can you know if you if you don't need a

00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,090
mixer that's gonna be a high-volume

00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,860
service so if you don't need a mixer

00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,000
don't run a mixer it'll make it easier

00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,010
you turn it on later

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,020
right but it'll it'll make it so you can

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,600
adopt easier you can adopt faster you

00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,820
can show that success show your boss hey

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,470
this project is is you know showing

00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,210
returns and making progress it's a good

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,980
deal and tell people about this please

00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,630
right tell people just remind them you

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,030
don't need all the components if you

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:44,020
don't want them hey thanks for listening

00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,660
yeah I think that's all I have to say so

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,740
I have a Twitter handle and I tweet

00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,740
there it's not very good

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,900
[Applause]
