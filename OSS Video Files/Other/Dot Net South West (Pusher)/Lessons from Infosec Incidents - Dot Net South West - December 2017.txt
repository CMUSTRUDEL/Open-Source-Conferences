Publication date: 2018-01-31
Playlist: Dot Net South West
Description: 
	Securing a web application is a challenge. The internet is awash with malicious traffic and web applications are globally accessible. Don’t make it easy for them and the baddies will move on and find someone else to annoy.

We’ll look at the risks facing web applications, the basic steps you can take so that you don’t make yourself a target and the things you should do to avoid becoming a data breach statistic. We’ll also look at lessons that can be learnt from mistakes that others have made.

We’ll demo some of the techniques and tools in both attack and defence with examples for any web application developer.
