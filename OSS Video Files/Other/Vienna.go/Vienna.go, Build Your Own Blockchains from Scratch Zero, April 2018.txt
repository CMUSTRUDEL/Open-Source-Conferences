Publication date: 2018-04-12
Playlist: Vienna.go
Description: 
	Learn how to revolutionize the world one block at a time with your
own blockchains build from scratch (zero) in go. Let's start with
(crypto) hashes and let's add a proof-of-work with configurable
difficulty. Let's check up on your hash rate for mining new blocks and
much more. Get ready to build your own money (printing) machines,
(digital) gold mines, pyramid schemes and more. Blockchain! Blockchain! Blockchain!

	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,700
anyway to get sir it should be twenty

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:08,970
minutes not you can stop me if I'm going

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,610
on for too long so the magic alchemy how

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,219
can you turn turn digital bits you know

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,940
into real money into yours dollars yen

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,910
you know but what do you want and here

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,130
you have the transactions yeah and the

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,320
Austrian chillin you know the the coin

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,000
base is the biggest mountain grows

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,850
Klockner euros Vinita and you get the

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,570
shillings so this looks you know silly

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,750
but how can you make it into real cash

00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:41,820
and it's simple block chain blocking

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,850
block jr. you put it on the blockchain

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,520
and the magic happened yeah it's real

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,920
money and the what what's a blockchain

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,379
you know decentralized payments

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,710
decentralized transaction decentralize

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,870
banks or it's not the central banks it's

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,210
 the banks because you don't need

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,489
banks anymore and so what is a

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,369
blockchain a blockchain is it's a

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,680
distributed database it's a hyper ledger

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,210
accounting book it's consensus with

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,970
proof of work or a proof of stake

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,750
digital fingerprints cryptographic magic

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,450
hashes it's a lottery central bank % in

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,369
general solutions you know so that's all

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,659
the magic blockchain blockchain you know

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,060
yes yes yes yes so that's I have a open

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,750
what blockchain a page to collect you

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:35,130
know what there's a what blockchain but

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,680
these are all you know it's not all the

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,829
magic of the blockchain and of course

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,439
the proof of the pudding in English is a

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,960
proverb how can you check if a pudding

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,090
is good you have to eat it you know and

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,420
then if it tastes good then you know the

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,220
proof of the pudding is that it was work

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,290
if you and so the proof of the pudding

00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:00,420
I'm I I'm if I'm a crazy guy or whatever

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,210
but you know can I prove that this

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,670
blockchain magic works and so the proof

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,060
of the pudding is the Bitcoin blockchain

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,970
you know billions of dollars real money

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,290
you know it's no joke so it's working

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,329
yeah

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,709
and of course the joke with Bitcoin

00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:19,290
nowadays is it's not

00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:22,230
it was the blockchain but now there are

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,719
many Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin classic

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,629
Bitcoin classic gold bit cold silver

00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:31,530
Bitcoin Ruby bit current platinum you

00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:34,260
know and Bitcoin shilling but it will be

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,650
bit chilling without Bitcoin so it's an

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,489
incredible success story and the well

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,969
first Bitcoin payment so a guy on the

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:48,930
milling I said I give you I'll give you

00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:52,230
10,000 bitcoins the first person who

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,780
sends me a pizza I give you 10,000

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,989
bitcoins and what did they say they said

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,180
 you you know we don't need your

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,669
pity currently averse nothing you know

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,950
and they had a on the email so they were

00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:08,269
selling bitcoins so the estimated verse

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:13,230
was about $40 at this time you know and

00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:16,409
so somebody called pepper Jones and send

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,500
this guy a pizza I think he was and so

00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:21,720
he got 10,000 bitcoins here and now the

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,060
question is you know it's like the

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,599
national day they celebrated 20 million

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,780
dollar pizza day but you know that's for

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,359
the person of the magic to turn it into

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,109
money and anybody knows how much it

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,430
works today

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:40,919
10,000 bitcoins so I updated the chart

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:43,799
the highest was like 20,000 dollars for

00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:47,849
a single Bitcoin and I think now it's

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,430
about five five thousand today might be

00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:55,650
five thousand US dollars five thousand

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:58,049
euros and what's to build to build a

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:03,150
blockchain you know from scratch from

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:07,739
zero it's like there was in a job

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:10,530
posting for a full stack group to God

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,750
blockchain developer know because you

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,180
know if you have to be a crypto god to

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,250
work with blockchain all the money all

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,659
the magic you know billions of dollars

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,779
you create out of nothing

00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:26,570
so blockchain blockchain and so is is

00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:29,360
and the message is you know it's it's

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,430
a linked list so if somebody comes to

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,280
you here can you handle an area linked

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,950
list so it's there's no magic the

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:41,750
messages yes you can you know you don't

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:44,890
have to be afraid and to build a

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:48,980
blockchain and let's build a blockchain

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:52,250
in 20 lines so I'm not come not adding

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,980
the blank lines you just have to count

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,920
them either I posted it online and then

00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,840
somebody say oh these are 22 lines it's

00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,240
not 20 lines or something you know

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,710
so the blank lines are not counted and

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,070
you can make it you know more camp

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:11,150
compact to wrap it up so if it's 30

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:15,080
lines or 20 lines there was a article

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,300
that like more it has 200 lines but it

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,180
doesn't but the important message is a

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,060
block chain there are different levels

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,340
that's the block chain network the big

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,940
network and then there's the block chain

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,070
database it's the second but at the

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,500
basic core is the block chain is just a

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:37,190
data structure like an area so can you

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,690
imagine you know the Austrian economist

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:43,430
ministers he's starting a linked list

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,940
Austria energy initiative if you don't

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,220
atop the link list you know you will

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,620
don't evolve you die so it's like you

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,270
know an airy Airy

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,860
Austria there's the blockchain if you

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,890
don't know there's blocks in Austria you

00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:01,340
know from the Austrian government ten a

00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,390
ten point plan here so that we survive

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,490
in the future from the

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,380
government-sponsored

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,660
blockchain Austria anyway so here you

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,850
see the the complete code of the

00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,670
blockchain what is the magic you know a

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:17,600
blockchain is a list of block or a chain

00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:20,480
of block block it and it the magic part

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,600
are the crypto hashes the crypto hash is

00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:29,290
another word for crypto hashes is the is

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:32,840
a digital fingerprint or a digest and

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:36,410
here we have the block and we have the

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,810
hash so to make it easy usually you work

00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,169
with bytes but in this simple example I

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:46,229
use strings so the

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:49,439
is the authority tube 32 byte string

00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:51,779
then we have a previous hash which links

00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,960
which is a reference to the previous

00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,599
block then we have the transactions so

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,080
in this case my transactions are in the

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,180
data string that's the payload you know

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,330
which are the transactions and then we

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,419
have a little a timestamp and as a

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,169
random date I pick 97 day that's the day

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:13,680
I was born

00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:17,659
that's you know not Jesus Christ in 1970

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,189
you know it's then the new area a pork

00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:22,650
so acquitting it's unique you know at

00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:25,259
the pairs of eunuchs and they start the

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:29,189
first second and so that timestamp is

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:32,060
just the integer and the magic part is

00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:35,419
this calculating the hash and

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,830
calculating in the hash the crypto

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:40,529
everything is done in go there's a

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:44,159
crypto package and there are different

00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:49,319
algorithms and so we we pick the Bitcoin

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:53,009
secure hash algorithm 256 bits but

00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,289
that's the you give it the bytes and it

00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:58,259
gives you back the the hash and I

00:07:55,289 --> 00:08:01,169
convert the hash from binaries to as to

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:04,080
a string the string and to create a new

00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:06,779
block to mine to my new plucks you know

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,180
you give the block the data the

00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,969
transactions you have to have the

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,759
reference to your previous block then

00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:17,219
you add the timestamp it's time now all

00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,219
UNIX UNIX gives you the unique seconds

00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:23,460
and then you calculate the hash and I

00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:26,310
calculate the hash by using using the

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:30,360
transactions the previous hash and the

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:34,289
timestamp and then this gives me back 65

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,750
characters hex characters or 32 bytes

00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:39,959
because you know one hex character are

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:43,589
four four bits one byte has eight bits

00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:47,640
and 256 if you multiply anyway and

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:51,680
return a new block that's that's a fully

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:56,970
working blockchain

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:59,130
and that's am I kidding let's build a

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,890
real blockchain so the real blockchain

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:05,220
is we start block 0

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,790
it's the Genesis verse the beginning of

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,270
everything

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:12,120
the Genesis block and so the Genesis

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:14,970
block has no parent has no previous what

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,120
is the solution you know what what - do

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:21,270
you put in and so to get the inspiration

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,090
from Bitcoin what what this Bitcoin

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,130
doing Bitcoin so the gain SS block how

00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:31,400
do you know it's the Genesis block they

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:37,280
are using so it's 64 these are 32 byte

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:40,350
256 bits and 64 so in this case 64 hex

00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,560
hex characters so that's the the

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,500
previous hash it's all 0 and that's the

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:51,110
the Genesis and so for the block for the

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:54,870
next block we just put in the the hash

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:59,550
for the for the previous block you know

00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:01,980
and then it's the choke about an area

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:05,640
usually you know the link is by hash

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,400
what's a ID of a block the idea of a the

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,350
unique ID of a block is the hash and if

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,140
you link the blocks you link the blocks

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,470
by using your hash so it's not you know

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,900
so when if you usually they hate the

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,270
heat of a block means you know they are

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,940
one after another one and if you put in

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:26,250
in an area you automatically get the

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,300
index of the areas they hate you know if

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:33,450
you put in here two blocks in an array

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,420
you get the blockchain you know and area

00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:39,300
element zero is like an assist the block

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:44,070
1 block 2 block 3 you have easy access

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:47,580
and so that's in two lines you have a

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:51,860
fully functional block chain and now am

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:54,420
I making it up so the important part

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,060
where the minister might be right you

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,770
know it's not a linked list the

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,220
difference between a linked list and a

00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:04,019
block chain is the magic crypto the

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,899
cryptographic hash

00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:10,559
magic and the cryptographic has special

00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,749
magic links the blocks and the magic

00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,050
properties you cannot change it you know

00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:20,220
if you change the content of the block

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:22,559
your hash changes and if you change your

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,959
content and the hash changes the link is

00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,869
broken you know if you change the block

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,999
content you break the link and if you

00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:33,269
break the link the block chain is broken

00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:38,970
and if you have a broken blockchain then

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:42,179
you know that's the magic and so if you

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,610
use just the print you know you give in

00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:47,459
go format print and you give it the

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:51,559
block and this is how it looks like you

00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:54,989
know the seconds from 97 T so it's like

00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:57,959
the the time in integer and why do they

00:11:54,989 --> 00:12:01,199
use this format they useless format just

00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,019
you know it's shorter you know - if you

00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:06,269
if you save it on on the database it's

00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:09,360
just easier to save it's just an integer

00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,309
then the hello cryptos you know you have

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,670
to imagine these are the transactions

00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:17,910
the payload and then two important parts

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:20,040
are here are the hash of the block and

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,540
the hash linked to the previous block

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,339
and you see you know the zero is the

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,769
they made up so you see that's the

00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,740
genesis block and if you look closely

00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:33,259
you know this hash and this hash do you

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,389
see a difference

00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:38,730
so these that's the magic link of the

00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,920
blockchain and so if I would change here

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,779
just one letter up case the lower case

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,959
you know the hash changes immediately

00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:48,179
and then the link is broken

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,660
cryptographic magic and so if you post

00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:54,389
this online okay oh this is not a

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,629
blockchain you know you are screwing me

00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,769
you guys came out just accused they

00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:01,110
don't want to be accused of being

00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:04,290
scammer so I asked Emma

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,619
so what proof of work you know proof of

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,449
work and consensus that's you know

00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:12,660
distributed decentralized proof of work

00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:15,600
that's can you add proof of work okay

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,480
maybe two lines of code and we have

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,690
proof of work

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:25,260
so and that's another important feature

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:28,710
of proof-of-work is the lottery the

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,230
lottery against corruption and yeah so

00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:34,500
how does the proof-of-work

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:37,170
work and the consensus so the magic

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,980
about Bitcoin and the blockchain is the

00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:44,490
lottery and so what you do is if you

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,140
calculate the hash every time you

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,080
calculate the hash if you have hello

00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:52,380
cryptos you always get the same hash you

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:58,470
know same input same hash and the hash

00:13:52,380 --> 00:14:00,870
is always 256 bits and in this case we

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,180
have seen to calculate the hash we use

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,760
the the transactions the data

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:12,870
the previous hash and then we have the

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:16,380
timestamp and so yeah and so how can we

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:19,320
make this in in a lottery and how can we

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,310
make it in a consensus that everybody

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,320
agrees that the that these blocks are

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:28,830
authentic and they real the truth and

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:33,120
everything and so how it works is it's

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:35,940
if you create a hash in Bitcoin you know

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,760
it takes ten minutes to find the hash

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,220
how come you know if I calculate the

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,360
hash I'll show you later in if I

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:47,400
calculate this hash on Ingo on this my

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,920
little computer it's eight hundred

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,910
thousand hashes in a in a second so I

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,910
can calculate it hand mean hashes in a

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,160
second so why would it take me ten

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,520
minutes to calculate the hash you know

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,830
to prove that I win the lottery win the

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,050
lottery and every hash calculation is a

00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:09,510
lottery ticket that's the proof of work

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,090
you can only you can only win the

00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,160
lottery if you calculate the hash you

00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,740
know there's the joke that somebody says

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,630
you know God you know I believe in you

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,060
you know you are the best and whatever

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,830
but I'm disappointed you know I want to

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,410
win the lottery you know when I believe

00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,480
in you and 10 years past 15 years and

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,430
I'm not winning the lottery and then God

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,400
says you know you loser buy a

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,080
ticket

00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,970
a ticket and you are going to win you

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,500
know because he was complaining you know

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,750
he's not winning in the lottery but was

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,880
not buying any tickets you know and so

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,490
here the magic is the proof of work is

00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,280
you you can how do you prove that you

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:48,010
are playing the lottery you can only

00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,080
prove by calculating the hash and every

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,240
hash calculating is a lottery ticket and

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,090
you have to find the lucky number

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,680
but where's where is the lucky number so

00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:03,910
the lucky number is let's go to the next

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,670
one well the lucky number yeah

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:10,620
so an important part the crypto magic

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:13,510
secure hash so the first part is I

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:19,000
already mentioned it secure so Bitcoin

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:22,030
is using the sh8 256 anybody knows what

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,900
it stands for there's like sweet home

00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:31,660
Austria still hacking away so this

00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:34,300
secure hash sh2 other 56 is the secure

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:39,270
and so we are getting back to the secure

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:42,370
part it's a secure hash algorithm and

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:46,390
anybody knows who invented that's the

00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:50,610
conspiracy theory who who invented and

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:54,970
who gave this Algar a to the world is

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,990
the National Security Agency NSA from

00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,450
the United States

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,280
anybody know these guys they are

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:04,060
watching you right now

00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:06,400
so hello so they they design this

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,380
algorithm which is great because you

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,730
know it's secure how do we know that

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:15,420
it's secure we trust them you know now

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:18,220
I'm just kidding is if you have a

00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,410
cryptographic algorithm by definition

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,990
you cannot trust anybody and the only

00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:26,230
way to trust that it's working you have

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,270
to publish so this is an open algorithm

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,150
there's no secret you know and it was

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:35,140
analyzed anybody can analyze it and so

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:37,270
it's open yeah public domain no secrets

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,100
but it was designed and donated by the

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,460
National Security Agency of the United

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,020
States and so the secure how can you

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,780
create a secure

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,330
hashing algorithm and the most important

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,390
part about a secure algorithm is if you

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:55,270
change one bit you know the hash changes

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:58,390
completely yeah and what does this tell

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:01,900
you for a lottery you know if you do a

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:04,180
gaming or gambling what's your source of

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,700
randomness you know because if you want

00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,980
to crack a gambling machine you just

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,930
have to find out you know that actually

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,460
it's not random if you know the random

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:15,310
seed you know then you can calculate

00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:19,810
there you know sorry the randomness and

00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:21,790
so here the random part is it's it's if

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,220
it's secure it's by definition if it's

00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:26,140
the more secure the more random you know

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,240
and the more random is there's no way

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,490
you can calculate if you change a bit

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,420
there's no way to calculate you know how

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:37,030
this is how the how the hash is going to

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,040
change and so this is the perfect for

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,170
two parts the perfect part is the

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,330
lottery how can you find the lucky

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,430
number the only way to find the lucky

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,830
number is there's no way to calculate it

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,870
the only way to find this you have to

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,730
try and try and try and try you know one

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,040
two three four and that's how you

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,230
there's no way you can shortcut to any

00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,330
way and the other one who is going to

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,030
find the lucky number you if you want to

00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:03,130
fight corruption then in in the greased

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,750
democracy what have they done when they

00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,120
invented democracy so they tried

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,390
different things one way is let's say

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,420
how in Russia you know you elect one guy

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,910
and then you have the next election and

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,770
suddenly oh this we have two hundred

00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:20,230
million or let's say five hundred

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:22,930
million people and then in the next

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,940
election or what surprise the same guy

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:28,450
but we have one hundred million people

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,640
you know that's and so here who is going

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,500
to win the lottery the next time you

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,320
know every ten minutes in the blockchain

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,360
a new block a new lottery who is going

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,340
to win you know is every year I'm

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,470
winning I'm winning I'm winning that's

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,180
you know and then you the guy who's

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,950
winning he's checking if everything is

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,660
in order I know if every time the same

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,030
guy is checking if everything is or and

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,450
so the magic part of this lottery is

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:54,880
that it's random and you're not you

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,070
don't know who is going to win and so if

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,580
you have a network let's say with 200

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,010
nodes

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,350
everybody's calculating you know then

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,600
every time it you have a perfect

00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,640
distribution and it's a perfect

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,890
distribution also against corruption

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,020
because every time you know you don't

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,480
know who is going to check the next time

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,430
that your books are in order you know

00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:20,350
you don't know who is going to find

00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:23,050
there they like it ticket and so and and

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,270
the important part it it's how does now

00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:28,180
the the magic so sorry for the long

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:32,200
story so how does it work in practice

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:36,700
so this magic lucky number it's called

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:39,460
nonce not for nonsense but it stands for

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,800
number used once you know because the

00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,270
lucky number you use it just once and

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,130
how does it work

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,990
every time you calculate the hash you

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:51,250
get the same same results you know and

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:53,260
so how do you get a different hash you

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,060
get a different hash by just adding a

00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,370
number you know if you add the number

00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,860
one and you calculate your hash you get

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,360
a different hash now you add two it's a

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,580
different number a different bit you get

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,680
a different hash and now the challenge

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,960
is what is the big challenge everybody

00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,620
know what's the big challenge in Bitcoin

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:14,970
and the proof of work in the hash so the

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:19,150
big challenge is if you see in the hash

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:21,340
above the big challenge is this is just

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,140
a number you know the computer is

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,870
working with numbers and bits and the

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,900
hash is just you know a big integer

00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:31,270
number and so the challenge is this

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:34,000
number has to start let's say in this

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:38,620
case with four leading zeros you know

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,440
and so this is a hex a hex number which

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,440
means four leading zeros one hex number

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,760
is four bits and four hex numbers which

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:52,540
four zeros is 4 by 4 is 16 bits and 16

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,350
bits of zero and so the number has to

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:58,990
start with 16 bits of leading zeros and

00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:01,810
so oh and to calculate the probability

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,460
if you if your stroller dice and the

00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:05,740
dice has one two three four five six

00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,680
then you have six possibilities you know

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,740
if you have two then it's 6 multiplied

00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,260
by 6 if you have three you know

00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,780
that your chances to find to have 666

00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:19,830
and in this case zero zero zero you know

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,950
you have to find 6 x 6 x 6 so in this

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:26,790
case it's a hexadecimal anybody knows

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:33,300
how many numbers does a hex have HTML

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:35,160
has 10 so it's 16 and so 16 1 0 is 16 so

00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,800
what's the change here so if you're

00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,800
looking for a single 0 it's your chance

00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,960
is you need C 16 maximum 16 tries on

00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,559
average because it's not a perfect

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:52,800
distribution almost and so for 4 it's 16

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:54,720
x 16 x 16 x 16 for 4 times 16 and the

00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,630
important part it's it's exponential

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,170
you know the bitcoin is looking for 23

00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:03,780
zeros and you need all the computers in

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,910
the world need 10 minutes and so to

00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,429
calculate you know that's what what

00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,559
changed there's not a big change that

00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:15,090
changes if you have this number used

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:18,090
once nonce and we start by 0 and then a

00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:20,190
for loop this is the you know a loop

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,590
forever and what you do is you calculate

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,780
the hash and what you do is you

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,809
calculate the data the transactions you

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,929
add the nonce and then you check if this

00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:32,820
hash that you get back has the bingo you

00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:36,030
know the lucky number the leading zeros

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,730
if it doesn't have the leading zeros

00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:41,880
then what you have to do you add +1 and

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,640
you try the next one year and so on this

00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,960
computer this might be more there might

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,790
be a million hashes in a second you know

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:57,179
calculating but in this case you just

00:23:50,790 --> 00:24:01,290
have to to find this number so what is

00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:03,360
changing so we add the nonce the lucky

00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:08,070
number you know if anybody wants to

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,679
check up if this block is in order then

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,600
you just need the hash and the nonce and

00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,670
then you calculate it in milliseconds

00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,650
but if you create a new block if you

00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,490
mind a new block you know compute hash

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,179
which proof-of-work

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:23,910
you go and it has to find the knots you

00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:28,860
know the lucky number that's the how the

00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:32,100
mining works and so am I making it up

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:34,679
so that's version 2 version 2 of the

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,660
blockchain so we added 3 more lines and

00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,390
we ago we are good for we have proof of

00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:42,630
work and we have consensus the consensus

00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:44,790
just means that the longest blockchain

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,940
bins you know every 10 minutes a new

00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:50,730
plug and the longest chain bins but if

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,850
you see the difference here if you look

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:57,059
at the hash you know you see here that's

00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:00,480
the nonce and what do you see in the

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:04,320
hash you know it has for the hash has

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,480
four leading zeros and the nonce you

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,340
know if you remember the nonce was the

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,790
loop forever you know and it's

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:15,510
calculating 0 1 2 3 4 5 now the question

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:17,340
is you know how many tries so this block

00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:21,660
you know how many hashes did it

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:24,690
calculate try so in this algorithm yeah

00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:27,540
it tells you a hundred and five thousand

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:30,300
hashes here and after a one hundred and

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:33,000
five thousand hashes one and six of

00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,429
course you know it has found the lucky

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,100
number and so now the question this guy

00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:40,290
above you know the lucky number what's

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,300
the lucky number how many how many times

00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,760
did how many did they have to calculate

00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,130
so it was forty two thousand two hundred

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,080
and seventy-eight you know and you see

00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,390
the numbers are different why are they

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,460
different because it's a random you know

00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:56,070
and it's poor chance you can calculate

00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,860
your chances here if you increase the

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:02,490
difficulty you know if you increase the

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:04,800
difficulty to let's say for 40s yours

00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:08,340
you know you are calculating you know

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:11,750
the universe will no longer exist that's

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:14,520
the the big the magic of the big numbers

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:18,300
okay I mentioned a couple of times

00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:20,250
what is your hash rate you know well you

00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,960
know what's your it how much do you

00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,919
charge but in this case you know what's

00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:29,610
your hash rate of if you're mining or

00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:33,000
your computer and so all this I think I

00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,710
have it before if I have this open open

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,910
blockchain anybody knows the open block

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,179
change on github

00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:41,910
so these blockchains they are if you go

00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:43,830
out to get tap open blockchains plural

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,549
with s and then there's all some

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,370
blockchains

00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:49,230
blockchain go there's like a JavaScript

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,630
Ruby Python version but there's the go

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,900
version and so this code you know you

00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:57,090
just grab the file public domain and you

00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,429
can run it on your own and this

00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:04,039
what's your hash rate this is an open

00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:07,830
block chains and so I'm a big fan of

00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:11,210
secure hash 256 so we have a fan page

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:15,330
it's called awesome awesome secure shell

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:18,179
256 yeah and it has hash read go it's a

00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:21,210
small not sure if you can save for a go

00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:23,370
or code a script but that's the you know

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,309
it's missing the import but it's if you

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:29,400
click here it's online you have the code

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:32,880
and what it does is the difficulty so

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:36,929
the factor is the number of zeros so to

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:40,350
find 1 0 you see 1 0 4 bits

00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:42,780
hash calculated 56 the time 0 you know

00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:45,120
it's so fast it's not even a millisecond

00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,020
it doesn't even you know it's so fast

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,539
anyway

00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,360
but factor to you know I'm still waiting

00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:53,760
you know factor so I just treat factor 7

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,210
year if you do factor 8 it's 15 20

00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,299
minutes and factor 9 it's you know you

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:03,720
have 18 euro couple of months because

00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:07,020
it's exponential is no joke anyway so

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,960
what what it does it has just the loop 1

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:13,020
to 7 for the difficulty and anybody does

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,970
the strings repeat with the factories

00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,820
it's just you know two zero three zeros

00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,010
four zeros five zero six zeros and

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,470
here's the magic you know time now

00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,450
before and time afters and then I

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,520
compute the the proof of work you know

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,980
and this is you know it calculates hash

00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:32,780
hash hash hash hash hash until it finds

00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:36,360
it and then it tells you know how much

00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:41,130
time and how many hashes and if you

00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:44,460
divide the hash hashes through the

00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:46,500
seconds you get your rate per second so

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,590
I have a very you know I work at the big

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,980
insurance company so they have old

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:55,169
Computers IBM still I think IBM and so I

00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,549
posted it on Twitter and a colleague

00:28:55,169 --> 00:29:01,890
from tried it at his computer and he so

00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:06,140
I'm you see it here I get eight hundred

00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:09,960
thousand hashes in go on a low-end

00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:12,330
notebook computer Ingo and so here the

00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,539
Apple state-of-the-art upon wood poke

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:17,940
you know anybody guess how much he can

00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:19,970
do so he had like three million you know

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,549
three times three million hashes per

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:26,159
seconds and before I've done it in Ruby

00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:28,110
so you can laugh at your B Ruby a

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,409
scripting language had about a hundred

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:33,210
thousand so I was like the just same

00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:36,090
machine you know using go was eight

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,010
times or which is to be expected you

00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,929
know the rule would be like C code is

00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:44,100
ten times faster than you know if a

00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:47,429
Python or Ruby script but yeah so it's

00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:51,000
like let's say this machine would have

00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:55,649
like a million or more hashes per second

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,510
and yeah so now on you can run you're

00:29:55,649 --> 00:30:00,029
encouraged to run it on your machine and

00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:03,510
now the quiz is you know you know the

00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:05,250
hash rate of Bitcoin of the network or

00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,299
the other one is if you buy a chip you

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,549
know a mining chip

00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:10,649
you cannot compete anymore so a minor

00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:15,690
chip I think they have like a billion

00:30:10,649 --> 00:30:18,059
hashes in a second at least at least a

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,340
billion you know enemy and so they

00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:23,820
what's the the the magic the hash rate

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,350
is still going up you know and this is

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,149
the crazy part you don't need it so that

00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:31,080
the part of the hash rate is completely

00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:34,649
useless there's no value in this crazy

00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,320
hash hash part you know but anybody if

00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:40,590
that's to see if you're sleeping but

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:44,520
what's the idea of the hash by doing the

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:46,049
hashing so they do the hashing that you

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,230
want to have a block every ten minutes

00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:51,390
you know because if there's no limit you

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,309
know you can create a hundred thousand

00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,809
hashes you know in a minute in a second

00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,090
you know but because it's so hard to

00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:59,370
find the hash you are guaranteed you

00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:02,490
know you only get a new block every ten

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,270
minutes and and so the only this crazy

00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,280
part you know

00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:08,640
has the only meaning is you know they

00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:11,580
want a ten minute or if if a different

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,970
block junior you can say the eatery room

00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:18,060
sky they are crazy I think they have ten

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:21,140
seconds you know every block every ten

00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:23,280
seconds so they have trouble you know

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,990
distributing the blocks in the network

00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,390
because every ten second year you know

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,130
you're trying to catch up and the next

00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,500
the next next every ten and so at ten

00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:35,520
minutes you know it's if you go around

00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:38,400
the network it's nice and slow anyway

00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,800
yeah and so this is the only part is is

00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,390
about the two parts the hashing the

00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,120
meaning of the hashing in the one part

00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,770
is that ten minutes and the other one

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,200
the secure part is the random lottery

00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,990
you know for the corruption is who is

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,260
going to do the next next block you know

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:57,060
that's the part is every it's random and

00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,520
so you are getting if there are a

00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,320
hundred people then you know you get to

00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,940
build your block and you should get your

00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,130
reward so that's the corruption in the

00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,440
Bitcoin buy it field you know because

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,540
the idea was everybody can take part in

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,400
the mining and you get you know if you

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,350
do the block you get the Bitcoin but now

00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,050
you have a big mining pool you know and

00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,420
so and they are winning a bit of 50%

00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:20,640
mining pool or whatever but the idea was

00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:22,770
you know that every node you know is

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,350
taking part in the core in the network

00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:27,060
and then you get your Bitcoin and every

00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:31,170
time you know there can be no that's the

00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:33,630
famous 51% rule if 51% are corrupt you

00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:36,120
know they can take over the network with

00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:39,030
anyway so the question is what's the

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,880
Bitcoin hash rate and you see it's going

00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:44,220
it's going to the moon it's going to the

00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,440
moon and so it's I think if they're

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,350
number it I think that doesn't exist but

00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,660
it's like 25 million trillions of

00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:54,000
trillions of hashes but you can imagine

00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,590
you know this computer and they all the

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,010
all the computers in the network need

00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:01,080
ten minutes to find and it's just I

00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:05,490
think it's just 23 zeros you know and

00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:09,960
it's 256 so you can add more you know so

00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:11,790
it's impossible to which brings us to

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,800
the next part you know Bitcoin

00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:15,750
blockchain money it's completely not and

00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,600
crazy you know

00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:21,360
and the energy waste and so forth and

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,630
and ten minutes to commit okay you know

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,910
you can do the Easter iam where you have

00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:32,550
seven seconds and whatever anyway so

00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:37,110
it's your you know privileged now you

00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:39,570
know the magic you know of the magic

00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:41,910
because if you read the papers the

00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:44,580
article in the newspaper it's like the

00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:48,180
mathematical puzzle to find for the mind

00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:50,820
it's usually you know it's very mythical

00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:54,570
you know how it works but it's you know

00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:57,330
it's super trivial free money free money

00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:00,060
I'm giving away Schilling who wants

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,510
Schilling 100 chillin it's verse zero

00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:05,340
but you know get in on the ground floor

00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:07,140
let's say choke get another ground floor

00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:10,500
and it will you know it will go to the

00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,679
sky so anybody new tulipmania bubble in

00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:18,330
Holland what year you know you get 100

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,730
chilling so it's it's 60 is 37 P thank

00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:24,360
you and I heard like what's the most

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:28,379
expensive tulip they no longer exist it

00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:33,050
I give you a tip it was red and white

00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:37,560
you know white with red so it had white

00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:39,899
white what's the name the leaves and

00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,149
then sprinkled with red because the

00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:45,389
single color they were the Commons they

00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:49,169
had no value only the multicolor and so

00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:51,810
the Stamper Augustus you know forever or

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:54,800
Gusteau's the greatest emperor of the

00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:59,070
history so same power Cousteau's and

00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:02,850
here I was trying to do I have to skip

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:05,370
this one if anybody's interested in

00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:08,010
transaction so if you've seen that I

00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,540
have hello Kryptos the data strings but

00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,700
if you add the transactions you know

00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,130
there's no magic you know you just add

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,230
the from to the important part is you

00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,570
know if it's a accounting ledger you

00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,610
have you're sending the tulips or you're

00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:23,190
sending them money then you have a firm

00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:25,350
account and a to account and it's called

00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,480
double accounting double entry

00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,000
accounting you know you have credit and

00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,680
debit and if

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,670
you add something to your book you know

00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:37,700
all this double entry from - were debit

00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:42,170
and credit and so in this case max -

00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:44,450
Isabel so I'm adding this this stuff in

00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:46,670
the next didn't sorry

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:49,610
and so what I'm trying to build for the

00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:51,940
Schilling Central Bank a library a goal

00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:55,370
library which is an open block chains

00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:58,730
working progress and so you know you can

00:35:55,370 --> 00:36:00,980
just use new block so it's in an early

00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:05,600
stage but it should be in the next

00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:09,230
week's and joking about you

00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,650
are you joking about the shilling so the

00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:13,820
inspiration here there were lots of

00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:16,670
Eastland was famous you know there was

00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:19,220
the GABA menu we give everybody the day

00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:22,640
our water and so it was you know a small

00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:25,610
they're like carrots the Iceland might

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,550
have 200,000 people so it's easy you

00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,620
know to give everybody free money and so

00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:32,300
was it working you know it was working

00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,630
in the beginning but then everybody

00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:38,090
wanted to exchange the new or a water in

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,890
two dollars you know and anybody guess

00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:43,070
what happened when everybody exchanged

00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:45,620
they are or and cells two dollars it

00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,240
collapsed immediately you know favorite

00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:50,180
cells so the important part to remember

00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,830
who the whole never sell you know

00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:55,220
because if you're starting to sell you

00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,700
know it's going to collapse so hold hold

00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:59,330
hold

00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:02,180
anyway so touch golden it's no joke it's

00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:05,570
real and I've given the the JavaScript

00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:09,940
talk in September and so I updated this

00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:12,020
chart today and the funny part is when

00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,480
in September October

00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:18,110
it was the market capitalization was

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:22,630
fifty million dollars you know and now

00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:28,880
you see it survived the big the big

00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:31,820
20,000 Bitcoin rally and it's getting

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,760
stable but it has now it has tripled

00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:36,050
almost four times so instead of the 40

00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,790
50 thousand millions

00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:42,790
now the Dutch golden is almost you know

00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,790
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:47,479
million US dollars

00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:51,680
you know it's to almost 200 million u.s.

00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:53,269
dollars you know so the shilling bit

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,210
chilly rock solid

00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:58,160
we are not scamming anybody in Austria

00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:01,670
you know rock solid you know we're

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,369
honest people so and the important part

00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:07,549
is invest only if you you know trust if

00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:10,969
you trust this on the skies and it's

00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:13,940
going to launch and you see I'm not it's

00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:14,569
not just a white paper it's working

00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,920
software

00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:21,200
I have image here the central bank note

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,630
you know and you click mind block on the

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,450
test network anyway it's going to start

00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:28,640
you get 43 you get forty three shillings

00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,359
in the beginning that's the country code

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,849
of Austria

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:37,309
you know Bitcoin start it is 50 so we're

00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:40,160
starting with 40 43 and then the

00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:43,160
National Day October 26 so hold your

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,819
purse 100 in 97 days you know we are

00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,259
launching in 197 days but probably only

00:38:46,819 --> 00:38:50,509
the test network

00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:53,839
oh yeah the important part is it's on

00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:56,869
github you know on github get up calm

00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:00,279
get up calm Bitcoin if anybody has

00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:02,900
checked a Bitcoin code on github

00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:06,859
anybody knows like how much how many

00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:09,589
lines of the initial Bitcoin revolution

00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:12,680
how much C code anybody who wants to

00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:15,349
guess I can give you an example I work

00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,049
at an insurance company and we do let's

00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:20,119
say a car insurance you know and the

00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:23,150
enterprise Java guys you know factory of

00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:26,509
factory and over engineering in ink

00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:29,359
level you and so let's say this one one

00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:31,940
calculation for this insurance work are

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:35,269
two hundred thousand lines of Java code

00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,650
you know just you know for inputs and

00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:38,269
then you get you know that's your

00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,369
insurance premium

00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:42,680
so this factory factory Java guys two

00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:44,900
hundred thousand lines of code but the

00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,529
Bitcoin billions of dollars you know how

00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,299
many lines of C code you can go to

00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:52,489
github you know get a Bitcoin common

00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:54,619
this is github.com pitch chilling you

00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:55,589
know that was the because the shielding

00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:58,650
was taken on

00:39:55,589 --> 00:40:01,799
so I had added a bit bit showing so it's

00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:06,390
about I think it was 40 50 thousand

00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:08,519
lines of three code and that's this one

00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:11,189
guy you know I'll show you later

00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,489
that's one guy how do I do it and go you

00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:16,499
know if I do it go you know I need a

00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:18,930
3,000 lines you know so he has done you

00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:21,539
know he's not accepting any contribution

00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,519
because he wants to but there's if you

00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:25,619
build it and go you know a single person

00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,319
can do it you know not over the weekend

00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:30,059
but you can do it in ten days and you

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,130
have a complete from scratch you know

00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:34,349
I'm building two versions

00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,329
I'm building a cool version and a ruby

00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:38,459
version for the pitch chilly but it's

00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:41,579
the same you know building your central

00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:44,039
bank it's you know there's no magic in a

00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:47,549
ruby it's a if you have a library you

00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:50,180
know it's 3,000 lines of code anyway so

00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:54,569
the important part yeah that it's online

00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:58,559
get up and check the code they go

00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:59,599
version and so the Bitcoin magic what's

00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:04,170
next you know

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,699
money money money of course but if

00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,439
you're a greedy who are not greedy you

00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:10,619
know you want to conquer the world you

00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:12,719
know it's anybody what's next for the

00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:15,150
blockchain what can you put on the

00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,279
blockchain you know now you can you you

00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,890
can print money you know but what more

00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:24,150
can you do know is this good enough you

00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:27,299
can put cats you know kiddies small cats

00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:30,749
puppies small talks you you can put them

00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:33,089
on the blockchain and what does what

00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:36,299
what's the point of putting a cats or

00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:38,910
dogs on the blockchain of course you

00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:41,670
turn it into money you sell

00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:44,309
they are tradable and they you can call

00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:47,219
them collectibles you know or digital

00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:49,799
assets anyway you know the anybody own

00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:52,979
crypto kiddies cryptic heads

00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:57,509
nobody's invested you're not yet

00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:59,099
convinced more puppies they're dogs what

00:41:57,509 --> 00:41:59,910
the land was you know the Lambos are

00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,859
anyway

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:05,489
so the kiddies puppies dragons lumbers

00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:08,099
but it sounds funny so and that's also

00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:09,070
I'm doing the crypto car this because

00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:13,060
you know I'm

00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:14,920
in the it's serious business so I'm in

00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,440
the beginning from the by tears you know

00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,030
I'm saying there you know if you do this

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,040
token sale they're worth nothing

00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,540
and so it's yours piece you know they

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,730
are threating me too you know

00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,680
I'm we are going to ruin your life you

00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,080
know you're accusing of you know you're

00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,210
running away or whatever anyway so if

00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,970
you play with the blockchain it's yours

00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:36,640
business and so fun fun fun fun yeah the

00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:37,840
script Oh kiddies that's a great part

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,760
you know you can play with the

00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,770
blockchain and it's who is taking your

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,200
serious you know I'm I'm trading a

00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,660
kiddies and how many kids do you have

00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,810
and you can breed a kiddies there's even

00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,730
one one guy he's selling a Japanese and

00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:53,470
you you can preach you know and that's

00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,730
how you create new value you know and

00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,640
then they're the own and you can sell

00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:59,740
and there's something called the that's

00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,170
how how how created is there's something

00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:04,060
called the Japanese where one part was

00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:06,640
the celebrities you know you can collect

00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:09,010
celebrities that was a complete scam and

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,140
that guy collected the money and after

00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,570
three weeks you know the site is offline

00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:15,340
and it's not coming back you know he has

00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:17,320
collected a couple of millions anyway

00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,050
but there's one inspired by the

00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,330
celebrities it was it's called Japanese

00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:24,460
porn stars and then you can breed them

00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:26,890
you know but you don't see there at the

00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,110
action so it's really a fun fun fun

00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:31,800
so the kiddies are accurate part dragons

00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:35,740
lambeth but the important part is the

00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:38,410
non fungible tokens which means unique

00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:41,650
bits and bytes so every every cat is

00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:43,480
special every cat is special and if you

00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,400
have a dollar a dollar a dollar is a

00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,530
dollar shilling is a shilling you can

00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,720
add a shilling and so if you trade a

00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:52,480
shilling you don't care but if you treat

00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,790
cats or these collectibles every it's

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,980
different and so now the magic part

00:43:54,790 --> 00:44:00,010
serious business you know it's not

00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,750
anything let's say land you know they

00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,480
are selling there's one called crypto

00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:07,870
countries you can buy Australian you can

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,570
buy you can buy the United States and

00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:13,750
the guy got greedy but did he got greedy

00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:15,790
with this game so he in in the world

00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,920
there are 200 countries you know and he

00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:20,050
has at the map and you can buy Austria

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,800
and it works the guy you know if you buy

00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,770
Austria you own it you know

00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:29,090
but it's capitalism if somebody comes

00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:31,790
along and and pays more then you know he

00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:35,210
will own so the guy who pays more is

00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:37,460
going to can snap snatch it and so and

00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:39,440
he gets his commission yeah and the guy

00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,810
under him in a classic pyramid scheme

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,790
you know he gets also his money back you

00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:45,980
know and the last one is holding the

00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:47,420
back but you know you're holding Austria

00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,030
you're precious

00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:53,090
so it's fantastic so it was working like

00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:55,310
fantastic but then he got ok I'm screwed

00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:57,860
you know 200 countries you know I want

00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:00,860
more money money money so what was his

00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:03,710
next adventure crypto cities you know

00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:05,990
there are 10,000 cities in the world so

00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:08,840
he's selling you you can buy Vienna you

00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:11,180
came by you know New York and so forth

00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,550
and because it's a pyramid scheme you

00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,500
cannot buy Vienna you know first you

00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,390
have to buy first karate you know some

00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,610
other cities and then once you have

00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:21,980
invested you know you can buy the bigger

00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:25,190
ones anyway the important part land land

00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:28,870
houses apartments you know yeah that's

00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:30,920
the so the cryptic Achilles sound sound

00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:33,320
funny or something but the serious

00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:36,080
business is the collectibles you can put

00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,940
apartments houses lands cars you know

00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,800
you can put everything on the blockchain

00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,020
and then you can trade you know if you

00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,630
buy a house you have this you know the

00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,910
Revolution land rich history house and

00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:52,030
everything is tradable on the blockchain

00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:55,940
and the best way to get started or the

00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:58,730
the crypto kiddies so that's how they

00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:02,000
look everyone is ever you see everyone

00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:04,390
is live different chains generation and

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,900
everyone is different you they have

00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:12,530
different colors anybody knows the most

00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:16,150
expensive the genesis are the most

00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:19,150
expensive cat salt how much did they

00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,150
donate

00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:30,880
how much 100,000 yeah good guess yeah so

00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:33,100
they sold it was also their funding the

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,970
founding cat so they sold on three or

00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:39,730
four cats for $100,000 the biggest one

00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:42,359
but now you can the cheap ones now the

00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:46,060
breeding female in comics you know is

00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:48,730
nobody is going to sell you a cat below

00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:51,880
the breeding fee and so it's about I

00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:55,090
think one one dollar or something the

00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,700
cheapest and now they're more than half

00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:59,619
a million every 10 minutes every 15

00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:03,210
minutes and this case every 50 minutes

00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:07,090
every generation zero cats for one year

00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:10,030
until November and 100,000 the most

00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,470
expensive but you see this one's anyway

00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:14,470
if anybody's interested I have the

00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:16,960
crypto kiddies and the copycats a ruby

00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:19,480
version of crypto kitties and then I

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,310
have the copycats on the blockchain the

00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,770
crypto collectables and that's the

00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:28,359
awesome blockchains and now the

00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:31,210
important part the articles so anybody

00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:34,390
if you check and Ingo you know there are

00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:37,240
great serious so this guy he has a

00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:40,830
serious called pilk cotija on blockchain

00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:43,840
ingo and every you know every part is an

00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:45,640
article and she shows on kita PSD code

00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,609
so the basic prototype it adds

00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:51,910
proof-of-work adds transaction then the

00:47:48,609 --> 00:47:54,359
addresses so in my case if I had the

00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:57,310
transaction you know I have the name

00:47:54,359 --> 00:48:00,570
Yosef Maria Theresa and in the real

00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:03,280
world you have you know you use a

00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:06,040
cryptography for your address number

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,750
like a account number addresses and then

00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,180
the network you know it builds a

00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:13,869
complete part and there's this one

00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:17,560
that's last year and this one is pretty

00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:19,660
new I think it's January February or

00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:22,540
March in in less than 200 lines and then

00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:25,050
it has the mining and the networking

00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:27,430
part using a web service and then you

00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:30,070
exchange with you know to you exchange a

00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:32,340
blockchain as JSON and it even has you

00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:34,390
know latest technology proof of stake

00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:37,480
how can you make a stake

00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:40,720
you need a cow cut it apart and then you

00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:43,990
grill think still free in in Vienna

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:49,390
going to tono Antonio to do steaks for

00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:52,330
free proof of steak yeah so maybe I skip

00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:55,330
this one yeah it's the part it you know

00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:57,220
it's with the tokens and these are

00:48:55,330 --> 00:49:00,760
examples you know Austria and blockchain

00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:03,280
on the rice you know and you see I feel

00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:06,280
from Austria high quality and Arnold

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,880
Schwarzenegger you know we are and so

00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:14,680
they're here guys so why you do I think

00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:16,450
I was just putting on that you know you

00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,430
should be extremely careful if you

00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,710
invest in this token because at Bitcoin

00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:23,290
you know everybody accepts Bitcoin or

00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:26,260
you know it's money but these are called

00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:28,450
these tokens are not money the shilling

00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,360
is going to be you know money and it's

00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:33,610
half a joke but these ones are so called

00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,830
application tokens you know you can only

00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:38,080
use it word for that for the blood for

00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:41,940
the hero platform you it's not you know

00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:45,310
nobody's accepting these tokens only the

00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,660
and so what's the worse that where's the

00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:48,910
decentralized part you know

00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:50,590
decentralized means you know nobody's in

00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,560
charge but here you know if there's no

00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:55,360
hero company then there is no hero token

00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,400
you know because they are the only one

00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,620
accepting and the value of the here

00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,540
token of course is zero but if you buy

00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:03,430
it you know you have to buy it for real

00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,920
money and they tell you what do they

00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,630
tell you you know now they tell you

00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,880
because it's going down they tell you

00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,710
just hold it you know because if you

00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,810
don't hold it you know and you sell it

00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:16,570
it's going down more you know and it

00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:18,790
will go to how far will it go it will

00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:21,250
code to zero because this is you know

00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:22,950
they have no open source code or no

00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:25,660
platform you can't just you know and

00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:29,140
basically they just collected your money

00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:31,180
and they part apart this is there are

00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:34,540
two fools you know if you buy it you are

00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:37,030
the you are the fool in acid if you

00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:39,670
think and here here's a new one you know

00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:42,880
so this one happened last year and this

00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:45,310
is going to happen now it's called the

00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,220
crowd it's not the crowd to eat in

00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:49,650
Austria you know it's the crowd

00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:52,140
kondeh Austria and so they are tweeting

00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:54,599
you they are tweeting February 20 they

00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,880
are tweeting Saifi crypto investors are

00:50:54,599 --> 00:51:00,690
investing making return on as mad as

00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,400
high as 50,000% you know and then if you

00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:06,060
read this article so I click on this

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,119
article and I'm not making a 2-day moon

00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:11,369
you know we are here at the accelerator

00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:12,900
accelerate accelerate you know and we

00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,320
are going to beat record where are we

00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,200
going

00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:18,750
where are the prices going to the moon

00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,300
anyway and so if you read us paying off

00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:23,460
big times if you you don't get any

00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:26,099
interest if you put your money on in the

00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:29,130
bank account 10% in stocks you know and

00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:31,650
here if you're you know bitcoin they

00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:34,410
pour bitcoin only a thousand percent you

00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:36,599
know but this token you know not only a

00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:38,880
thousand percent fifty thousand euro and

00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:40,619
and they show you you know a hundred

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,170
dollars you have a hundred dollars you

00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:45,720
know you know a big guy a small

00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:48,630
capitalist hundred dollars and we give

00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,640
you you know fifty thousand dollars you

00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:53,339
know in a year how do you say you know

00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:56,820
Shep is a chubby little trading yeah

00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:59,040
just hold and so what's the point of

00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:02,160
here of course this is of course a

00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,800
 you know and you think that's a

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,349
scam or is that the scam I mean if they

00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,970
are telling you and that people are of

00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:12,060
course who doesn't want to get rich you

00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:15,240
know and more sophisticated

00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:17,220
there is the pimp it panda Panda scale

00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,680
you know that if the South Sea Bubble in

00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,440
in England there was you know they

00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,240
invented the the first real problem not

00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,119
the tulip there was the South Sea Bubble

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,880
in in England and that was you know

00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,010
England was not yet an empire but it was

00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,750
the trade with the colonies you know and

00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:36,300
they if we are going to trade with

00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:38,430
America South America you know we are

00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,960
going to get rich because the Dutch you

00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,790
know they were getting rich trading in

00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,490
the East Indies but the trouble was you

00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:47,970
know the Americas was part of the

00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:50,070
Spanish Empire so no so to trade and it

00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:52,170
was a monopoly so it was impossible to

00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:54,960
trade but they were selling here we are

00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:57,330
everybody was making up and so bit panda

00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,320
they are posting 7 March they're posting

00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:02,620
yeah we will offer if you

00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,210
collecting ten thousand ten millions of

00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:07,460
dollars they will collect it's running

00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:09,350
now you know and they are telling you

00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,540
what are they doing with this magic

00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:15,140
money they are building a future-proof

00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:18,020
solution here that will create tokens

00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:20,660
for all four block chains you know

00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:24,170
they're you know future proof you know

00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:25,880
III was their opinion yo I don't know so

00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,710
this might work you know I cannot

00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,440
predict the future who can predict the

00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:32,960
future they can you know its future

00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:35,870
proof and then all platforms you know

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,480
all plot for blockchain platforms now or

00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:41,300
also all plot blockchain platform in the

00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,830
future you know you see this is and they

00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,490
have great material you know they are

00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:48,860
not like the average so they're

00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:51,650
collecting so and so why do you think

00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:54,650
sorry that's the before the books that's

00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:57,500
a lot before the last so why do I think

00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:00,620
that they are going to collect your

00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:03,260
money and then it's not going to if you

00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,750
read the legal part about the token it's

00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:07,640
not money you know and in the legal and

00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,830
the pentose here with bit panda they are

00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:12,170
the best well you know they're the most

00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:14,990
honorable it's the first unicorn of

00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:18,410
austria so they will you know a million

00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:20,390
a billion euros the first unicorn in

00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:23,060
austria the most value of a company

00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:26,900
stirrup anyway and so if you read this

00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:29,240
the legal thing it is in whatever form

00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:31,610
you know it doesn't represent any you

00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,830
don't have any claim at all you and they

00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:36,260
will not exchange it you know there's no

00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:38,660
you cannot say oh I want my money back

00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,080
or I want just the seat you know I give

00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,360
you money

00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,490
your for your enterprise and if it's not

00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,320
working out at least you know sell off

00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:47,690
your furniture or whatever you know you

00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,750
have zero you know nothing

00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:54,380
so let's rent no claim here and you

00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:57,410
cannot exchange it in money and at any

00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,970
time you know they can do they can do

00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:01,760
with the money whatever they want you

00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:03,710
know you cannot say oh you you you could

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,750
say it we have to you are building a

00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:07,160
platform you they you know there's no

00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,590
they don't have to build a platform you

00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,210
you can do with the money it's at any

00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:13,640
time they can solve this Gretchen

00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:16,450
discourage I mean they can do what they

00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:18,920
so my liberal interpretation

00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:21,109
interpretation is thanks for the free

00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,940
money easy money and thanks for holding

00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,079
the bag that's the important but

00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,329
hoo-hoo-hoo

00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,970
you know don't sell dog here find

00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:31,549
greater fools find greater fools to

00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:33,980
their marketing we make you rich you

00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:36,970
know and so what's the point is you know

00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:39,650
what's the value it's my opinion your

00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:42,920
investment advice P please advise your

00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:44,720
lawyer know it's so Bitcoin has value

00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,609
you know the network and for general

00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,740
payment but this video is this

00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:51,680
application tokens is and the first

00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:54,410
business you know in pizza do you have

00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,240
friends you know money you know talks

00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:58,010
you know and in business business this

00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,319
business you know just not oh you're mad

00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,490

00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,770
you know if you're on board straight you

00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:07,130
know Wall Street owns if you read the

00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:10,130
history digital gold so Wall Street owns

00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:12,619
you know the the Bitcoin you know they

00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:14,839
are holding because it was you know was

00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,220
cheap you know fifty million dollars you

00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:19,609
know that was is at peanuts you know

00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:21,349
they bought at all and now so but the

00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:23,270
greed is that's a funny part the greed

00:56:21,349 --> 00:56:24,740
is destroying you know because if you

00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:27,230
have money and you're not using it you

00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:30,079
know you're holding if you did a history

00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:32,270
if you're gold you know the Spanish boss

00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,950
they were thinking you know we are

00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:35,809
collecting the gold from the Americas

00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:38,390
you know and we are the richest and the

00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:40,579
rich and they British that you know Adam

00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:42,200
Smith said you know your gold you

00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:44,059
know you're not rich you know the wealth

00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,799
of the nation is not your goal you know

00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:48,770
it's what you know you have to produce

00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:50,750
and trade you know that's how you and if

00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:53,299
you have money and you're not using it

00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:55,160
you know then the value of the money

00:56:53,299 --> 00:56:57,140
decreases you if you cannot pay with

00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,599
your bitcoins you know you're destroying

00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:01,579
the system you so they and agreed you

00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,410
know they are holding holding so they

00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:05,690
are destroying their own the greed

00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:08,599
destroys Bitcoin because they are not

00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:11,299
using it for payment anyway so I might

00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:14,390
just be yeah that's just my opinion but

00:57:11,299 --> 00:57:15,859
read up there's a great book so there's

00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:18,500
lots of books you know

00:57:15,859 --> 00:57:20,990
blockchain is the greatest part of their

00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:24,529
so this anybody knows this attack of the

00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:26,480
50 feet blockchain it's $15 from a

00:57:24,529 --> 00:57:28,609
British guy from London

00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,720
so if you read this one you know that's

00:57:28,609 --> 00:57:34,430
fantastic it's he's a professional

00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:38,060

00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:42,920
you know about scams and it's complete

00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:44,780
and so this one is more serious you know

00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,359
mastering Bitcoin it's online free

00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:50,329
that's you know it's fantastic it's book

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:53,150
called the Bitcoin in detail so that's

00:57:50,329 --> 00:57:56,060
really the second edition even it's on

00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:59,540
github you can buy the book too and so

00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:01,460
it explains the Bitcoin and magic

00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:04,220
let's blockchain for dummies you know

00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:06,500
it's not not bad you know it's free

00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:09,859
download it's for business block change

00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:12,619
for IBM and high pal agile but it's you

00:58:09,859 --> 00:58:15,619
know if what's the hype about business

00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:17,930
so that's a free download you have maybe

00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:19,430
you have to give them the email but if

00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:22,040
you click on the link and there's a new

00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:24,200
I'm reading this one came out three or

00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:27,250
four weeks the truth machine from New

00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:30,020
York Times Wall Street Journal

00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:32,690
journalists from New York the truth

00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:34,280
machine you know the blockchain and so

00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:36,589
what they are saying you know the IBM

00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,750
blockchain is a fraud you know because

00:58:36,589 --> 00:58:42,349
it's just a database you know I've also

00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:44,540
the IBM meeting and then they they are

00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:46,280
selling a blockchain blockchains and

00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:48,920
then the guy was asking you know how

00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,470
many users does your blockchain have you

00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,970
know they are the IBM oh we have one

00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:55,369
user you know one note

00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:58,579
oh so if you have one one note you know

00:58:55,369 --> 00:59:00,800
maybe it's just a database you know or

00:58:58,579 --> 00:59:02,270
and and that's you know so if you have a

00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,690
blockchain it has to be you know a

00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:08,300
public public and then you have to if a

00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:10,520
thousand nodes or something you know but

00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:12,680
if you have two notes you know then it

00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,690
might be a little stretch and then you

00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,880
have two notes and it's not public and

00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:19,849
everybody has to log in you know there

00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,349
was I was a guy at the shilling meetup I

00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:23,720
have a shilling meet up every two months

00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:26,119
to build the shilling he has a webshop

00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:29,150
and he wants to put his webshop on the

00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:31,220
blockchain it's fine you know just put

00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:33,200
on you know know your vape shop based on

00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:35,569
the blockchain and Microsoft Access it's

00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,150
fine you you log in and they buy it yet

00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:40,610
you buy the stuff and you recording the

00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:43,070
database you know and so they die

00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:45,110
of course they are a different level but

00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:47,780
it sells you know blockchain blockchain

00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:49,730
and they sell their cloud service but

00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:52,070
they parties you know that's another

00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:54,650
discussion but you're all using the

00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:56,720
blockchain because you have seen the

00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:59,450
magic part of the blockchain is the

00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,880
crypto hash you know and then the other

00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:04,880
magic part is that distribution you you

01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,560
can download if you get clone you get

01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,160
the whole history you know and in

01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,710
Bitcoin

01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:12,830
you know you download the whole the

01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:14,870
whole history all the blocks or all the

01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:18,050
commits is like a kid clone you know if

01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:21,050
you run your Bitcoin node first you have

01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:22,970
to clone you know the repo and the funny

01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:25,190
part is of course it doesn't have any

01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:27,440
fork the consensus is a single branch

01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:30,260
you know ink it it can handle you know

01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,970
these are the branches the branches in a

01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,710
blockchain and the modern lightning

01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:35,900
Network anybody knows how they are

01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:38,960
called the branches and the lightning

01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:41,330
Network state channels you know I state

01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,520
you open a state channel it's a branch

01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:46,580
you know and then if you merge it back

01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,560
you know that state Chandler is you

01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:51,290
record it back in the commit you know in

01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:56,210
the block and so if you do a git merge

01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:58,250
you know you're an S with the the last

01:00:56,210 --> 01:01:01,250
one so that's to wrap up I hope that was

01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:03,230
that long is the they always funny and

01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:05,450
the same is with blockchain you know

01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:06,890
anybody understands kit you know I'm

01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:10,130
working a couple of years now with kit

01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:12,980
and if I have a trouble you know it's a

01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:15,080
here I don't you know analyze I just

01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:17,540
delete it and do a fresh git clone and

01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,250
so with Bitcoin here who understands

01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,440
that's why it's so crazy you know them

01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,450
and like money's involved you who

01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,910
understands blockchain and Bitcoin and

01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:27,890
and so how do we use it you know no idea

01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:30,530
you know you just memorize and you hold

01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:32,480
you believe and you're getting rich and

01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:36,470
of course you have to grow the network

01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:40,160
that's the pyramid scheme so yeah so

01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:42,400
thanks for its online and questions and

01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:45,900
hope it wasn't too long

01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,900
