Description: 
	Michael KÃ¶ppl will give a talk about vgo. When Go was first released, it had no concept of versioning software. Over the years, it became clear that a solution was needed and godep, glide, dep and many more came to be. vgo is the official approach by the Go developers to solve the problem of versioned Go software once and for all in a way fit for Go.
