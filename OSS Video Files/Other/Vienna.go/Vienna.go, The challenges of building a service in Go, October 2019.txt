Description: 
	Speaker: Daniel from Safing.io

Go is a perfect match for building a system service in Go, but there are numerous common hurdles to take in creating a scalable and maintainable code base. In this talk, we'll have a look at startup and shutdown procedures, resilient goroutine management, configuration management with live updates and a database layer with a websockets API.
There will be only few slides and lots of live coding and demo-ing (with prepared code).
