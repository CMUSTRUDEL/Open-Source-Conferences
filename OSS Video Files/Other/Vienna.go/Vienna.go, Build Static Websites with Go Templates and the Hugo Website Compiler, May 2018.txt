Thanks I try to be 50 minutes or to flip

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:15,690
through so they go who go website to

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:21,359
build websites the go who go is a

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:24,330
fantastic start and the website let's

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:36,329
get to my slides and okay let's start

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:38,700
with this one sorry okay sorry okay

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,550
let's start from the beginning so

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,000
building a building a website with visco

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:52,770
is go who is one of the biggest one and

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,140
if you build a website usually it's you

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,590
use a dynamic website generator and

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,239
anybody knows who are the big guys who

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,789
run the internet to run all the websites

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,049
and so they're the big website

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:09,930
generators anybody know that press

00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:13,760
WordPress Drupal Joomla so PHP the magic

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,470
the most popular language on the planet

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,590
Facebook so the rest is Facebook so

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,049
WordPress has I think 25 percent market

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,810
share so 25 percent of the web site on

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,960
the Internet are using WordPress which

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,990
might be a thing let's say 30 30 million

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,390
of websites and then Drupal and Joomla

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:40,680
they have maybe a two or three percent

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:42,930
so there's a big big a big gap and of

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,110
course the rest is Facebook so that's a

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,850
joke but as a static website generator

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,680
what's the different so if you have a

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,470
wordpress website of course you have a

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,259
database and every time you display a

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,479
website it does database queries that it

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,149
merges the templates and on every

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,549
requests you know it runs scripts and so

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,640
on and the force but if you use a static

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:10,050
website builder it's like if you are a

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:13,620
cocoa programmer you compile your code

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:16,440
so usually what I say is it's a website

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,560
compiler because you take your sources

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,660
and then you use the go machinery it's

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,550
just a binary and you compile your

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,680
website and you get a super fast secure

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:32,190
perfect website and so the main

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,400
differences you have no you have no

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:38,430
database and you have no application

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,150
server so you don't need PHP you don't

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,239
need Java or anything and even you can

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,400
go which is the new fashion you can go

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,349
so ever less of course you need a web

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,050
server to serve your files for your

00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:54,720
website but server less means somebody

00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,090
else is handling your web server Amazon

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,129
or or you use a different service

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,080
provider and all you need is a simple

00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,890
storage service you don't need simple

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,019
storage service

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,030
you just need you have a bunch of files

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,330
and you can host it wherever you can

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:12,360
upload it it FTP or so it's super that's

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,000
there and it's super fast because a

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,650
static file by definition you have a

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,110
super cache building you know if you

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,690
want to make a wordpress site fast you

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,340
have to cash in cash in cash and if you

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,489
have a static website by definition

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,500
every page is cached and and so on the

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,590
force so the main difference you know

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,950
there's no database no application

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,450
server

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:38,099
everything is built ahead of time and

00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:41,069
and now the question is who are the big

00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,000
guys you know who are the big guys for

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:45,659
the website

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,299
compilers build as generators in 99 Mac

00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:52,099
room anybody remembers my Microsoft

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:54,659
front-page Netscape composer or

00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:56,129
Dreamweaver so they it is you know you

00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,069
have your templates and they build your

00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:03,239
site and so of course today's who go so

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:06,890
who is actually the number two so this

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:10,709
is from a year and a half ago it had

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:14,159
10,000 stars and now today I think we

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:17,459
can check later it has 25,000 stars so

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,400
it's it's it's growing super fast it's

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,470
popular and it can build because it's

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,950
and here it's an old news

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:30,160
the good news is the guy from Norway is

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,770
the main developer and he just released

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,230
a new version today so usually it gets

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,110
updated you know new features pretty

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,450
quick and you can expect at least you

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,820
know one update amount and just you know

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,650
six eight hours ago there was a new bug

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,510
fix release and the major release was

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:51,780
just you know two or three days ago

00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:54,940
and yeah to get started with Google it's

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:59,410
it of course it has a website built with

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:02,560
hygge a static website go Google and it

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,450
has fantastic and to sell it now well

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,340
you know the kohu good website itself

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:11,410
now is I could marketing brochure I just

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,350
have to scroll down you know the

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:17,470
features it has everything building it

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,240
has custom output it has built in

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,300
multilingual so you can build

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,180
multilingual websites shortcuts and the

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:30,760
most important feature of course is the

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:35,380
super fast and to get started you just

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,240
go to the and also the code of Kahuku is

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,810
of course it's Co code and it's great

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:44,250
code to study it's high-quality go code

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:47,860
but to get started you go to the github

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,419
Kahuku website and here you have all the

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,300
code but you don't have to use it you

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:54,880
don't have to use go but you have to

00:05:52,300 --> 00:06:02,740
download that binary and so you go to

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:06,070
the releases you go to releases and you

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,740
see here it was ten hours ago the latest

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:12,330
releases brand-new just a part fix the

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:15,250
point three and then you download the

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,770
for your version and if you have Linux

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,570
or if you have Apple you can use Peru or

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,400
your package manager so you don't have

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,280
to download you know the package you can

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,190
use usually it's available on TB on and

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,710
on and so forth and for but that's is

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,560
how easy is to get started it's just

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,470
that's the major selling point of go you

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,940
know if if you have go to install you

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,580
just have a binary to install

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,610
if your customers they don't have to

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,820
install any you know machinery or

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,670
something like EndNote a packaged manner

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:56,890
all this is a simple binary

00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:59,650
okay so let's switch back get started so

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,780
once you install so it's the the

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,760
download package you've seen maybe five

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,800
megabytes and then if you unzip it I

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,680
think it's ten the binaries ten

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,860
megabytes and then all you who will help

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,050
yeah and so because it's on the command

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,950
line and there who will help command

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:20,560
line and it offers lots of features it

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,560
has a built-in server and of course the

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,320
most important feature is the build it

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,450
uses Patel's it's a compiler you give it

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,610
the source files and then you say build

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,890
and it builds your purchase and built

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:36,160
your website but for development it has

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,130
a built-in server and also it has what's

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,530
called scaffolding you can say Google

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,860
new and then it builds you know a little

00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,510
block with all ready to go so you don't

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,420
have to start from scratch so there are

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:54,490
different startup packages so let's see

00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:56,650
and let's build a simple simple example

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,440
I have a website that's called stay

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,560
static and so I collect website

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,140
compilers so every month I build a new

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,140
website which looks exactly like the

00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,330
website last month but it's using a it's

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,820
using a different compiler so I have

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,880
over ten and a couple of contributions

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,250
and and the exercise it has it has a

00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,919
blog and if you have a blog you have to

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,100
blog post things the posts and the blog

00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,450
posting has a date and it's

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,510
chronological you know the latest news

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:31,870
first so that would be the three news

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,940
and then at a page a page a page doesn't

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,250
have any date you know your about page

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,440
your info page so the website we are

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,330
building you know has the about page if

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,080
I click on the about page and then it

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,520
has even if you don't have a database

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,320
there's something called data files you

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,180
know if you have small data sets you

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,800
don't have to put it in a database but

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,399
instead you use

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,379
or yama or tamil you know simple comma

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,329
separate files and that these are called

00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:01,689
data files but you have your list of

00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:02,350
stores when this example what I use the

00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:06,249
data file

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:10,209
I have bookmarks so the links they are

00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:13,299
in in a data file and then from this

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:17,319
source it should build and so they stay

00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:19,660
static its online on github stay static

00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:23,949
so that's they stay static one design

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:27,399
many samples and so there are all this

00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:31,179
Ruby go and here's they go Google site

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,549
its life on github it's not you know

00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:37,480
there's not much there sleepout page if

00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:45,790
I click it doesn't have a date and if I

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:52,509
go back the this is the block and then

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:55,269
the last one is the the bookmarks so the

00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:57,629
World Cup is upcoming free free data for

00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,629
the World Cup

00:09:57,749 --> 00:10:12,820
that was the bookmark sorry ok and so

00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:17,080
the source oh sorry yeah that's

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:22,000
let's go here so that's the example to

00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:26,410
show you we are going to build and the

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,310
file structure and they also before

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:32,530
starting so they stay static on github

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:36,550
so it has for every it has the folder

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:38,200
and so the source for the Google if you

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:44,280
want to compare the different static

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,280
site builders so that's the they who go

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:51,760
that source

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:55,540
okay that's doing its own that's right

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,980
so how to get started so how do you

00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,410
structure your source code you know if

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,260
you build your code program you have a

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,640
source folder a test folder and so it's

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,840
the same principle if you build your

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,280
website you have layouts and then for

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,470
your layouts these are the HTML

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,530
templates and if you have a layout and

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:18,010
master layout or some page layout then

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,080
you also usually would want building

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,640
blocks for your layouts for the footer

00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,560
header these are called

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,660
the partials and then of course the most

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,080
important part is your content you have

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:35,170
your news blog postings and you have

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,120
your you know about info page and you

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:41,260
have the configuration the configuration

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:47,140
and then you have the styling for the

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:50,440
design and that's the the who goes file

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,960
structure so it's priam what's great

00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,030
about the Google file structure is the

00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,550
content so they try to keep you know

00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:01,180
that's a good principle to keep the comp

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,040
that your content your pages separate

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,060
from your layout and for all right use

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,850
from your styling so yeah so then let's

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:14,340
get started

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:17,430
for the now the quick port okay

00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,950
okay so how does it look like to create

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,830
a new blog posting okay a new blog

00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,990
posting you know it's a HTML page but of

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:28,680
course you don't want to write HTML and

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,020
anybody not using markdown or you know

00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,520
there's a something called you can use

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:37,440
text normal text and with some

00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,320
formatting convention that automatically

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,980
gets converted to HTML with 100%

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,350
accuracy and the rules are all simple so

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,529
if you use a link or a link is a little

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,600
more complex but anyway so this gets if

00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:53,610
you do a paragraph if you do a paragraph

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,310
all you have to do is you have to add a

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,710
blank line you know and then the

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:02,250
marketer knows this is a paragraph so

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,990
it's very intuitive and the important

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,640
part if you use these static site

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,310
builders usually they all have the same

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,740
principle they have what's called a

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,830
front matter and the front meta is the

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,640
metadata which in this case is the first

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:20,760
block and the goo-goo-goo is using

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:24,030
something called Tamil for thumbs

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,820
obvious markup language it's kind of a

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:29,370
better version than chasing anybody

00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,410
knows Jason so that the problem what's

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,900
the problem is chasing the problem is

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,030
chasing you don't have comments and it's

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,370
kind of not really for hand coding you

00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,710
know you want a data file format that's

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,950
easy for hand coding and here the

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:46,230
candidates are the llamo and but llamo

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:49,560
might has lots of features so it gets

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:53,250
complex if you do and so the Tom's

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,170
obvious mock markup language basically

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,420
in this case you see there are just key

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,000
value pairs you have the title and the

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,740
date and the separator are this plus

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,320
plus plus so you know you know that's

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,410
the but here you can it's a free form

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:12,480
you can add your own keywords as you

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:15,750
like and so that's easy to write and the

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,870
markdown madness so go has great

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,209
libraries but there's no official

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:23,940
standard markdown library for go from

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:27,510
Google but there's a fantastic library

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:31,770
so the Kahuku is using black friday and

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,630
so black friday okay maybe i skipped and

00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,430
it has lots of extension but black

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,070
friday why is it called Black Friday

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,320
because markdown if you go to a shop and

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,720
if it's cheap cheap cheap you know

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,880
that's called markdown so that's a

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,100
different sense but also markdown is you

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,170
know it's at the difference markup

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,390
markdown but usually you know if you

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:54,060
could if you want to make big money you

00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:57,089
put a pig mark up on your if you sell it

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,070
you know and if you have a sales and so

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:02,430
the the Black Friday's you know the pig

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:05,010
sales so that's kind of in choke for the

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,780
name for the market on madness but this

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,810
is accurate library and the great

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:12,720
libraries there's basic markdown

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:15,690
but then there is all this extensions so

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,990
the the black friday marked on extension

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,150
you have tables you know in HTML a table

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:24,709
so you can do tables you can use code

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:28,350
blocks footnotes smaller that snotquotes

00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:31,290
fractions for typography and i just skip

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,560
over them but if you want to use a table

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,540
that's how you you know it's the table

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,260
and if you would to have to hand code it

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,060
in HTML

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,610
it's very easier you know just to use

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:47,250
the pipe for your table and you get a

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:49,470
perfect HTML table and if all our using

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:52,260
a github that was an invention from

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,660
github the fence code block you know it

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,839
sounds fancy the fence code block but

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,940
all it does is three pack ticks and you

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,459
have three pack ticks to begin and the

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,459
three pack ticks for the ending and then

00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:07,770
it knows this is a pre-formatted code

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,220
block and even gets syntax highlighting

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,700
okay

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,190
and so i skip over all this you know

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:18,060
definition lists so all the the HTML

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:21,000
goodies you know you can do in text but

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,250
now let's before the important part HTML

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,579
templates the data file for the bookmark

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:29,190
and so who who is using this tom oh and

00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:31,500
if you have a data file in Chasen you

00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,930
would just have a hash with the entries

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,959
and here the convention is if i want to

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,820
have a hash with three entries or in

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,430
this and

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,500
you have to use double that double

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,590
brackets and then it gives you know it

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,020
just gives you a list with the links and

00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,210
every link has a title and a ul you know

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,010
but you can make it up as you like and

00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,800
now the important part you know how does

00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:57,560
it how do you use it in your templates

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,000
and so the good news is or that's the

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,310
bad news if you're a JavaScript

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,590
programmer so what's the downside there

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:06,350
all this website builders so what's the

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,600
big downside of the go who go the big

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,700
downside for if you don't know go the

00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,290
template language is the code template

00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,960
language you know and if you're a web

00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:17,900
designer and have no clue about go then

00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,150
that's the major you know a whole pack

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,070
for not using the super fast who go

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,020
because the template language is the

00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:26,480
goal language and they go template

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,060
language but if you are a go programmer

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,620
you know that's paradise because you

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,540
know your template language is not

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,420
something new or something but it's the

00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,910
official go template language and so all

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:41,960
we do if you remember we want to do the

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:44,630
two to show all the links and then it

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,450
just gives the the data file and the

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,450
convention is the name of the file it's

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,610
called links and then a site theater you

00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:56,060
know and then you can just loop over

00:17:52,610 --> 00:18:00,290
with the range that's the classic go and

00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:02,930
then you build you build your your map

00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,960
the building code for the map and the

00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:10,370
other example shows you the loop for

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,490
looping over then the news block so in

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,860
this case it has the site pages it gives

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,680
you all the pages which are that the

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,070
about page plus plus the news pages and

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:25,070
you have to use that type and then if

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:27,980
you select by type I only get my blog

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,950
postings and then you know I have the

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,890
list of blog postings which you know

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:37,070
that's how you you pull the the index

00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:39,110
page and the next part is if you have

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,940
your master template you want to have

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,070
building blocks you know not everything

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,500
in a single file but you can just

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:48,800
include in this case it's the master

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,360
template and I use partial and the

00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,970
partial is just you know to include the

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,760
header

00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:59,340
food and the head for the HTML page and

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,470
and the content the magic content is the

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,970
placeholder you know where everything if

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,640
you have a page everything gets merged

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:09,690
in here and that's the surrounding and

00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:13,370
it gets merged together but it's just so

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,370
the template language has the includes

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:22,770
and yeah that was what I was telling you

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,860
that the template options Ingo it's the

00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:28,110
official it's an official text template

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,870
package and it has all the documentation

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:33,540
on the in the library and to make it

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,610
secure there is a the HTML template

00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,100
package for the only difference for the

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:42,060
HTML template package it's like the text

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:45,840
template package but it has protection

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:47,790
against protection against injection

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,290
attacks over you know that you cannot

00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:55,860
inject JavaScript so it escapes the

00:19:52,290 --> 00:20:01,260
stuff but it's the same part and the

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:03,270
great news in goes go 1.6 they added 4

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,790
to the template package they added

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:12,650
blocks blocks are the building blocks

00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:15,420
small building blocks so that's usually

00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:18,390
if you look at other template languages

00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:21,420
a famous one is Django for example

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,310
that's pretty popular for designers then

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,550
usually you can if you have for your

00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:30,060
site you split it up in this block is

00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:33,360
the news block you know and so the code

00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:36,780
template language also now has this you

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,190
can use the blocks your main plugs or in

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,220
this case you know you have the title

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:45,440
block and and so forth so you can't give

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:49,320
every thing and an important part is

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,530
it's a shortcode because one downside of

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,990
the Go Go Google is it's not a scripting

00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,940
language if you use a JavaScript or a

00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,220
Ruby Python and if you're a website

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,170
builder you can extend it with your own

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,540
plugins you know when you just script it

00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,220
but in kohu you know how do you extend

00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,169
it

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,549
it's hard to extend you know you have to

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:10,159
go code and you have to create a new

00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:11,480
binary so that's a downside and so what

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,629
they are doing is if you want to have a

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:18,440
small macro or you want to own your

00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:21,830
smaller script you can do an HTML short

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,659
codes you know and one example is let's

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,059
do you want to add to your website a

00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:30,200
YouTube video and you don't want to you

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:33,019
know all this HTML magic you want to put

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,360
you know in a magic YouTube tab and so

00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:38,600
all you can do you use this HTML

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,429
shortcode that are supported by Google

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:45,950
and you can build you say YouTube and

00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:47,629
the macro that's the macro source which

00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,029
the macro source of course is using the

00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:54,019
code template and then that's what gets

00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:56,629
generated and another example is let's

00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:58,759
say you have a figure you know a figure

00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:01,070
is you know an image with a title and

00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:03,590
and all this stuff and that's how

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,840
complex it can can look you know with

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:09,470
your short clips you can really be very

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:16,190
creative and so it's more fun to use

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:19,090
them to build all this and not you or

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:22,279
anybody using it even supports

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:25,820
alternative template languages I'm not a

00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:28,639
big fan of these shortcuts but I think

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:31,970
they took supported one our ace of pace

00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:34,490
and ember they you know the HTML is

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,169
peyten style intended and then you don't

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,750
have to do the closing

00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:41,450
you know the body is just an indent then

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,429
indented like peyten so white space is

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,379
very significant it makes it shorter and

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:48,950
the attribute you know they have these

00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:51,740
shortcuts but this kind of I think

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:55,429
usually it's 30 percent or 20 percent

00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:58,190
like to this style but they maturity

00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:01,370
usual is like oh I don't need this

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,200
oh and to configure to wrap up you know

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,029
the configuration there's not lots of

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,159
configuration but you put your

00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:10,700
configuration again it's using that

00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:14,539
tunnel and that the image is the tunnel

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,549
is started if the windows ini format or

00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:17,570
they get configuration format that's the

00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:21,680
same thing

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:23,630
it has a specification and it has lists

00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,780
and everything that's that the idea of

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:29,390
the Tamil Tom obvious markup language

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,550
but it's just you know key value for the

00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,290
simple one you have the title the the

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:37,130
language code in this case I paid zero

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:39,950
in because this example is hosted not on

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:42,800
the main domain but it's a mini sub

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,800
domain mini site and so you can say the

00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:52,370
base URL and then to every link it adds

00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:56,690
the base URL and to sum up for a Google

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:59,690
now it has 25,000 stars and I'm not

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:03,190
making up there's a like the top 10 or

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:07,940
the top 100 static site generators

00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:10,820
static site calm and the number 2 and

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:14,480
the big one the wordpress of the

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:17,480
universe is cycle in Ruby supported by

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:23,420
github but you see who go yeah is number

00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:25,250
one 25,000 so that's a good choice and

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,640
it's super popular who who can do I

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:31,070
think it builds 500 pages a second and

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,640
chai kill I think you might get 20 pages

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:37,610
so it's it's like 10 15 20 times as fast

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,470
as cycle at least so it's if you have a

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:44,050
big site with thousands of pages you

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:47,390
know you can build it super fast with

00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:49,760
that's and so you've seen the

00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:53,300
configuration is in Tamil the

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,430
frontmatter metadata also this simple

00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,890
format the data files before the data

00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,930
files you can also and also for the

00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,880
front meta you can use if you want you

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:05,210
can use Jason and llamo and all this

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,520
stuff and an important part the CSS

00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,890
pre-processing the professional they are

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:14,360
calling the asset pipeline you know if

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:17,150
you want to to minimize your JavaScript

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:20,810
or to convert JavaScript 6 to Chava

00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:22,970
Script 7 and all the stuff or the CSS 2

00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:25,160
and so forth this is called the asset

00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:29,000
pipeline so there's no build in asset

00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,010
pipeline in in Kahuku and what this is a

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,610
solution the solution is the

00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:37,900
tell you you should install no chess you

00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:40,880
know internal chess and then you install

00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:44,030
it's a huge universe you know you pick

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,980
whatever it's the fashion and but what

00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,200
what's fantastic what's now building

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,580
they have built in in the new version

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,680
and go they have build in image

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,210
processing pipeline because you know if

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,100
you build a website usually you have a

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,020
image and then there are different area

00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,660
solutions and so if you image you want

00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,360
to have automatically I have different

00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,760
or a solution sizes for the image and

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,070
now this is already building into the

00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,560
Google so he can do you know if you give

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,360
it an image it does a reform are thing

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,120
that you have five six seven different

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,550
formats so this this pipeline is

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:20,060
building but for the CSS and JavaScript

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:23,210
pipeline you have to use no chess which

00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:26,840
is kind of a trick because then it's our

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:28,280
one feature is it's easy to install but

00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,390
now if you're using this you know you

00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:36,200
have to install them so thank ya that's

00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:38,540
was the demo you've seen the website oh

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,500
and and important about how it works you

00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:44,840
know once you who go build what you get

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,330
is the static website the master layout

00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,450
it all gets merged together and then you

00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:52,820
see it's the about page you know it's

00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,500
just your HTML and so that's the great

00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,750
part about the static you don't need a

00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:01,700
database you don't need application

00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:04,310
server with PHP with charmless child or

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,830
anything it's just plain you know plain

00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:09,110
files you can upload and they you know

00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:12,050
they work in two hundred years it still

00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:14,690
works you know you have WordPress you

00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,550
have to update every every three months

00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,690
you get the security update if you don't

00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,970
have that you get hacked

00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:24,110
how do you hack this you know starting

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:26,720
HTML it's impossible to hack and so it's

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:28,430
just unto Co life that's another part

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,680
there are hundreds of options free

00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,860
option you can free hosting on github

00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,170
for who go to it does it's not build in

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:42,050
so you have to upload the you build it

00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:44,840
and you upload the HTML and get push get

00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:48,490
lepage's get LePage's has support

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:52,870
for Google the search Google fire pays

00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:57,159
Amazon s3 and thousands of options and

00:27:52,870 --> 00:28:00,620
yeah and why you would use static

00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:02,779
instead of dynamic so the one thing is

00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,419
faster faster fastest there's nothing

00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:07,400
faster if it's a simple website and also

00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:10,340
it's simple you know if you can handle

00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,159
HTML and the other one is prettier

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,860
prettiest you are in control to build

00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,320
your own template you know you can start

00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,690
from scratch or you can copy but there's

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,549
no worry on the framework doesn't put

00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,820
much in your stuff you know if you do a

00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:27,649
wordpress template then you have lots of

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,659
documentation and it might be a big

00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:32,570
monster but here you know you can be

00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:34,640
pretty minimal do it yourself that's

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,490
also the downside you know who wants to

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,159
design their own template themes and

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:46,190
there are the good news is you can reuse

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:50,029
so there are think yeah so there are

00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:52,669
these themes on they all this open

00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:55,880
source seems on github and I think

00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:58,039
they're more than 100 different themes

00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,260
you know and if you if you keep your

00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:02,570
content separate from your themes you

00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,190
can just change the theme name we

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:07,570
rappelled and you have you know you have

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:16,690
a new look so they're all 100 different

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:16,690
already and yeah that's you

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:22,530
and another maybe if you have a block

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,150
and you really want to have comments so

00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,400
how do you comment with a static site

00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:28,620
the solution of course is server less

00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,740
you outsource it and so there are lots

00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,990
of different that discuss is the most

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:37,110
famous you just add a tiny javascript

00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,970
and then you have the comments editor

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:43,460
but they are different you know you can

00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:48,720
do it yourself or you go so ever less

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:52,260
with your own little service yeah so

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,680
that would be a OOP and yet the

00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,350
important part it has fantastic to get

00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:01,080
started there's a great documentation so

00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:04,740
the the who would documentation and of

00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:07,170
course this is a echo who go website the

00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,810
website is with pelvis with whoo-whoo

00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:14,000
itself and it's extremely well

00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:17,430
documented so

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,430
