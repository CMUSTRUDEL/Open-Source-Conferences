The State of the Kotlin ecosystem

Over the last three months I ran a survey of the global Kotlin ecosystem. My goal was to learn how developers use and adopt Kotlin - either in work or side projects, or just for playing around, and what are some of the most popular resources for learning it.
The survey was a great success, and gained over 2400 responses in total! The results are meant to become a resource for the Kotlin community. Something we can all look at for interesting insights that will also help drive adoption of Kotlin in our teams and organisations.

To give you a taster, hereâ€™s a few questions I asked in the survey:
How big is Android as a proportion of all Kotlin developers
Are people happy naming libraries and tooling with K
What are the favourite features of the language
What kind of DSLs are people building with Kotlin and for what use-cases

In my talk will answer all these questions, and more. But be warned, some answers might surprise you. Speaker: Zan Markan
