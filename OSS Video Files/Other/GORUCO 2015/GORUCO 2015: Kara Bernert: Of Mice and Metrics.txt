	00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,340
you

00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,370
you

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:22,230
kara I'm a software developer just but

00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,150
until recently I was actually working in

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,650
biomedical research and my degree is in

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,869
chemistry so I'm going to talk a little

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,060
bit about some insights that I gained in

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,420
the lab and the way I think about

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,970
applying them to the way we collect data

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,210
about our process and the software we

00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,130
built so I guessed I've been learning a

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,200
lot about software development and I've

00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,930
also been learning a lot about software

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,580
developers and one thing that I've

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,480
learned is that they are perpetually

00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:54,270
dissatisfied there's a drive to be

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,520
constantly improving optimizing

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,020
iterating we want quality we want

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,390
efficiency we want usability and

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,610
reusability for both our users and for

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,019
our fellow engineers and this leads to a

00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,290
lot of questions about the best way to

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,689
go about doing these things and then on

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,790
the other hand software developers

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,439
really like tools really like good tools

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,960
like building them finding them using

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,409
them so we have a whole toolkit that

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,479
brings us a lot of data what we're not

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,710
always so good at however is taking our

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,020
questions and data and bring them

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,820
together to get answers and this is

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,290
basically the problem that scientists

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,390
are trying to solve all the time and

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,900
they've been doing it for so long that

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,490
they've come up with a framework instead

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,900
of best practices for doing it so it's

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,299
the scientific method and it looks like

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,490
this probably familiar with it from you

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,740
know grade school but make observations

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,320
make a hypothesis to explain those

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,740
observations and then through you know

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,540
some kind of rigid set of best practices

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,260
for controlling experiments test your

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,510
hypothesis and then you know prove it or

00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,590
never prove it but support it this prove

00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:06,330
it and then keep doing this forever this

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,519
is great its objective it's really

00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,280
powerful it produces actionable results

00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:13,349
it's also frequently time-consuming

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,370
expensive and sometimes just straight up

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:19,260
and possible and I found actually when I

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,610
was working in the lab that only about

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,529
ten percent of the data that we

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:28,100
collected was produced by following this

00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:29,690
method to a tee whereas

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,130
if you want to get a paper published you

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,560
better have a lot more than ten percent

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,200
of your data come from the kind of

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,020
scientific method process and should be

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,430
more like ninety percent so what was all

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,450
this like data that we were producing

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:47,420
that we weren't publishing where we just

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:51,860
like bad scientists wasting our time

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,170
producing bad data I would argue no and

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,390
I think I can explain it with this idea

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,840
of a data hierarchy and it's basically

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:03,260
just a continuum of data at the bottom

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,330
produced just basically observations

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,150
that you can make a hopefully objective

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:12,080
observations to may be more specific

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:15,440
observations made to address a

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,890
hypothesis but that you know didn't come

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,090
from a carefully controlled experiment

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,370
you know is missing some of the elements

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,900
of good experimental design up to the

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,400
very top of the hierarchy where you get

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,670
the data that you know went through the

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,560
entire scientific method process and i

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,570
are i would argue that you can get

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,390
useful data you can get good quality

00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,900
data at every level of this hierarchy

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,970
and it's useful when you acknowledge

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,620
where it comes from in the hierarchy and

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,400
allow that to inform the way in which

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:50,960
you use it so there's all kinds of

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,750
useful data and i'd like to talk a

00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,760
little bit about some examples that of

00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,250
how we use data from all over the

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,690
hierarchy in the way we changed our

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:04,760
lists at gust so are we have a whole lot

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,680
of lift on our site of various different

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,200
kinds of data that we expect our users

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,490
to be able to interact with and we had

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,020
some problems with them and then we

00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,790
didn't really have a universal pattern

00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,140
for all of our lists we were getting

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,750
negative feedback about them they were

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,880
confusing and some of our customers were

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,739
just exporting their data to excel to

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,290
just completely avoid using them all

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:28,220
together which was a total bummer um and

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,860
so we set out to overhaul our lists and

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,920
to while we were doing so to put in some

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,220
kind of data collection around how

00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:41,060
successful and you know how the

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,680
new feature list feature did so the

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,790
first kind of data we got was the bottom

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,770
of the hierarchy cheap and plentiful

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,780
data everything that people could

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,430
possibly do with these lists we would

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,220
log it you know when they filtered when

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,600
they sorted when they took actions who

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,450
they were how long they'd been out in

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,700
the platform all kinds of data care very

00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,710
carefully gathered and organized but not

00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,840
really set out to answer a specific

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,610
question and this is good for just you

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,870
know going in and looking at the

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:10,760
patterns of user behavior we also had an

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,220
example where we did some of the kind of

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:17,630
middle of the hierarchy data collection

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:20,390
where we wanted to implement a filter

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,100
but we weren't sure if it was a good

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,420
idea and one of the things we were

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,000
worried about where it was that there

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,350
were going to be multiple value or a lot

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,960
of values of this filter that would

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,810
probably produce no results if users

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,400
were to filter by it but we recognize

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,010
that that was an assumption that we were

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,160
making about user behavior so we put in

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,320
a measure in our site to tell us how

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,320
many results people were getting back in

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,880
a set you know were they very frequently

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,450
getting back this is like empty result

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,400
sets and it you know it was addressing a

00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,470
specific question but we weren't really

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,450
doing like a very rigorous test and it

00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,220
was more to kind of inform maybe

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,860
improvements we do in the future or more

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,210
testing we'd want to do if we found out

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,620
that this in fact what's happening and

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,880
then we could figure out if that's like

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:10,340
a bad thing and address it and then we

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,340
wanted to evaluate like whether this was

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:19,460
a success and to do that we need top of

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:21,740
the hierarchy data and this kind of

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,200
experiment that we did had a pretty

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,910
simple hypothesis if we improve lists

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,050
people won't live our leave our site as

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,910
much okay that's great and you could do

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,740
a very simple test to figure out if this

00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,740
was the case you could you know roll out

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,660
our new list to half of the users and

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,790
leave half of the users on the old list

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,060
and change nothing else about the site

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:46,070
and you know wait a couple of years

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,260
until we got a statistically significant

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,930
sample size and we'd probably go

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,949
bankrupt like this would be great

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:57,400
science but it would be really bad

00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:59,410
business so have no fear there are so

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,690
like even when the top of the height

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,509
like the very best scientific test isn't

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,639
available or wise there are a whole lot

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,740
of tools that we can use to take kind of

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,210
other experiments that we could do that

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,669
might be lower down on the hierarchy

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:16,750
tanned bring them up so we decided to

00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:18,250
look maybe at either feedback because

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,780
it's reasonable to expect that there

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,430
might be a correlation between positive

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,120
feedback and people staying on the site

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,680
or negative feedback in them leaving so

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,539
we could measure the feedback we got

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,610
before we implemented these lists in the

00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:33,699
feedback after problem with feedback is

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:37,060
its qualitative data but we do have a

00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,680
tool at available to us called scoring

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,910
that scientists use all the time to take

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,520
qualitative data and make it

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,919
quantitative so you know if we made our

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,070
feedback quantitative we could then

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:51,039
statistically compared our you know

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:54,520
feedback quantities with our retention

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,380
rate of customers and you know establish

00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,039
a correlation there and then do the same

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:02,260
for the list the other problem with user

00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,599
feedback is it's a self-selecting sample

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:08,139
so it might not be representative of our

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:12,099
entire population or the population that

00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:14,979
we want to study but we can also solicit

00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:17,740
user feedback and we can create samples

00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:19,690
that using systems like earn

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,789
randomization that are non deterministic

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,099
so our stats are good but also our

00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,810
representative of population and control

00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:28,030
for a whole bunch of variable so you

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,370
don't get you know all of one type of

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,589
user in one group and all another type

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,680
of user and the other so we have you

00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:37,630
know randomization and sampling tools

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,310
and then if it still turns out that we

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,650
have some confounding variables that we

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,750
just can't shake with our experimental

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,279
design we can try to tease them out with

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,500
our analysis so we can do something like

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,200
an analysis of covariance and a

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:54,730
different statistic test statistical

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,850
cuts to weed that up and so that is how

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,350
our list problem and hopefully we'll

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,140
learn a whole lot about

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:08,820
feature and its success going forward

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:14,520
with that data and here is my requisite

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,520
