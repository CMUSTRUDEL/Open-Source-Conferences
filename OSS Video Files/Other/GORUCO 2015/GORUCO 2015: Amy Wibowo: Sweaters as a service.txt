Title: GORUCO 2015: Amy Wibowo: Sweaters as a service
Publication date: 2020-01-23
Playlist: GORUCO 2015
Description: 
	@sailorhg
In the 1980's, Nintendo had plans for making a knitting add-on to the NES, with an interface that resembled Mariopaint, but with patterned mittens, sweaters, and scarves as output. Sadly, this product never saw the light of day. Devastated upon hearing this and dreaming about what could have been, a group of engineers (who knew nothing about machine knitting) set out to hack a knitting machine from the 1980's to be computer-controlled, using a tutorial from adafruit as a starting point. Hear about our struggles and triumphs, which ranged from learning to replace knitting machine needles and conduct basic repairs, to emulating a floppy drive and hacking together a custom cable cable to send our own patterns to the machine, to writing our own yarn printer API in ruby/sinatra and printing our first doge meme in yarn. And watch us (LIVE!) as we send images and knit requests to our yarn server, and behold as it knits ugly sweaters from those images!

hi my name is Amy Webb ello I'm sailor

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:23,750
hg on the internet and a little bit

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,610
about myself um I recently started my

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,619
own publishing company to write computer

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,360
science scenes for high school age

00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:31,790
students and make computer science more

00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,790
accessible through drawings & comics and

00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,260
stories and I left my job as a developer

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,500
at Airbnb to be able to do this

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,090
full-time if you care about CS education

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,739
and want to come talk to me about this

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,699
afterwards I'd be super happy to talk to

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:50,179
you and today I'm going to talk to you

00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:52,749
about knitting I'll starting to start

00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:55,399
with an inspiration and here's mine a

00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:57,710
few years ago a video game review site

00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,870
called kotaku published an article about

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,359
Nintendo add-ons that didn't quite make

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,710
the cut you might hear have heard of

00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,320
some of the peripherals that did make

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,150
the cut a baseball add on to play

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,520
baseball video games a golf add-on to

00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,650
play golf game a super scope for

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,600
shooting games but you might not have

00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,370
known that Nintendo was seriously

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,439
contemplating making a knitting add-on

00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,439
and this is

00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:25,560
this is the proposed advertisement for

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,020
the Knitting add-on complete with bad

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,600
puns I'm not sure if you can read it but

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,670
in the right corner it says why needle

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,920
the competition so the interface would

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,319
be just like mario paint but instead of

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,020
seeing what you drew on a screen it

00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:47,939
would also knit what you had drawn onto

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,829
a sweater or mittens or a scarf most of

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,649
the comments left on the code to kotaku

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,000
article were along the lines of law we

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,310
can see why this one never made it to

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,890
production but I had a totally different

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,170
reaction I was so sad and heartbroken I

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:05,189
had never wanted so badly for something

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,349
to exist in my life so I did research um

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,390
didn't end o make any prototypes that I

00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,039
could get my hands on did anyone else

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,890
make home knitting machines that I could

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,230
use and it turned out that in the 1980s

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,209
there were a bunch of companies that

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,470
made home knitting machines but they

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,450
weren't very popular so we stopped

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,790
making them and that's when my dream was

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,209
born to get hold of one of these old

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,090
machines and to hack it to make the

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,590
Nintendo add-on that never was a state

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,870
would have it there was one of these

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,400
super old inning machine for sale on

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,620
craigslist an hour and a half drive from

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,599
where I live and so I went to pick it up

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,940
and it was broken in parts were missing

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,760
but it was a start it was start of my

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,910
dream and I was really excited about it

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,669
and this is to reiterate the dream again

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,769
in cartoon form to be able to take

00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,560
pictures to send them to a knitting

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,880
machine and to end up with sweaters

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,209
basically to create a network to yarn

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,980
printer um so now that I have gotten

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,870
hold of one of these machines the first

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,540
thing I needed to do was to learn how to

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,450
use the damn thing because this is what

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,970
a knitting machine looks like it has 200

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,349
needles that move an out and you can

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,540
thread up to two different colors of

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,849
yarn to create pattern and if this is

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,980
what using a knitting machine looks like

00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:22,170
this is what using a knitting machine

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,440
field like

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:29,430
and I was worried that if i press the

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,660
wrong thing that this would happen or at

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,530
least that I would break some of the

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,239
needles and have no idea how to fix it

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,099
luckily I had a team of people to help

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,980
me face this challenge that was both

00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:45,870
fearless and inventive I had a team of

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,819
Airbnb engineers that helped me hack the

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,459
knitting machine for an Airbnb hackathon

00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,900
Airbnb hosts internal hackathons twice a

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,680
year for the entire product team

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,150
including engineers and designers and so

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,220
many different kinds of engineers signed

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,130
up to work with me on this project an

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,010
iOS engineer an SRV a performance

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,750
engineer a front-end engineer and this

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,040
is all to say that we were a bunch of

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,310
Engineers who knew nothing about

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,989
knitting let alone machine knitting but

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,700
all of my teammates were super amazing

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,200
and this was probably one of the best

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,209
teams that I've ever worked on in my

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,660
life and I think that partly it was

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:25,500
because we all had Bureau ego attached

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,400
to knitting this was just kind of a wild

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,710
adventure that we were all in together

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,039
so after we set up the knitting machine

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:38,370
and were able to successfully knit rows

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,320
of solid color the next step was to

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,660
learn how to use the machine to knit

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,979
patterns and even though this was

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,840
something that was already built into

00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,490
the machine it was twice as complicated

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,680
as their first goal because there was

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,570
twice as much yarn to get tangled and

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,900
fifty more pages of the knitting machine

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,650
manual to read about how to set it up

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,350
from and just to show you how

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,270
non-trivial this step was on the left is

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,550
our first attempt at knitting one of the

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,580
built-in patterns and then many hours

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,450
later you can see that the polkadot that

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,450
they were supposed to be

00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:15,099
but after we had figured out how to use

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,709
the knitting machine built in patterns

00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:19,419
it still wasn't quite our dream yet as

00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:22,269
far as we could tell the intended user

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:24,129
of a knitting machine was a grandma in

00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:26,199
the 80s because all of the patterns that

00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:29,559
they had available were like polka dots

00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,209
both teddy bears roses and I don't know

00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:33,189
about you but I would much rather have a

00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:36,039
sweater with grumpy cat on it than a

00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:38,469
teddy bear so we're still important to

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:42,129
us to figure out how to send the

00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:44,139
knitting machine our own images which is

00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:52,659
step three of our goal and this goal

00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:54,399
would be split up into several parts so

00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:56,529
because it's from the 80's the knitting

00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,439
machine took additional fat earn via

00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:01,809
floppy drive and you could buy floppy

00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,519
drives that hat or puffy disks that had

00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:06,669
additional patterns to upload to the

00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,249
machine so we can emulate a floppy drive

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:12,219
in software and send that fake floppy

00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:14,799
drive our images and then we would need

00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:16,389
to build a custom cable one that would

00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:18,669
have connected the knitting machine to

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,729
the floppy drive but would instead now

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,619
connect the knitting machine to our

00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,749
computer so it would be serial to USB

00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:27,129
and we had to custom make this because

00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:28,989
the knitting machine had a really weird

00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:34,749
pen out and luckily we found

00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:38,229
documentation about that then we had to

00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:40,809
convert all of our input images into low

00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,729
res 1-bit bitmaps because that is what

00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:46,269
the knitting machine took as its file

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:48,959
format so here is one of our first

00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:48,959
custom pattern

00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:05,910
um and here's funky cat um so by this

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,790
time we were having entirely too much

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,410
fun with this knitting machine but we

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,100
thought that we might be hogging the fun

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,540
we didn't want sending pictures to the

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,880
knitting machine to be limited to just

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,750
us we wanted anybody in the office to be

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,670
able to do it so the next step was to

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,880
make knitting machine image upload

00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,650
available on the web and it would be a

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,830
super simple interface you choose a

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:36,360
photo to upload and then you'd send the

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:39,270
image to the machine and it would print

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,560
out instructions for which buttons on

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,030
the knitting machine you should be

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,020
pressing in case you would never used it

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:49,020
before and here's a video of it in

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:52,730
action and hmm I don't know if I have

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,730
the audio hooked up Oh

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,050
actually maybe tell them

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,860
you

00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,319
I

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,630
so here's a close-up of the input image

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,690
and knitted output in case it was too

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,580
small on my video and now we can look at

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,840
the code that made this possible it's in

00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,520
Ruby and Sinatra and it's super simple

00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,190
so we're at the library that converts

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,080
the image into a 1-bit bitmap and we

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,820
call that knitting pattern and there's

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,220
also a wrapper for the floppy disk

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,320
library that we found and we called it

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,450
pattern just drive and when the user

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,320
presses the upload button we save the

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:55,300
users image to a file use the image

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,460
processing library to convert the image

00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,340
to a 1-bit bitmap and then we start

00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,290
emulating the floppy disk drive and then

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,510
in the browser we display instructions

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,560
for the user for which buttons they

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,440
should be pressing on the knitting

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,740
machine so things that we learn from

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,600
this adventure we gained mad respect for

00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:18,070
grandmas and anyone else who knits

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,720
because that is hard another

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:23,100
learning is that teams work really well

00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,170
when they operate with your ego at stake

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,910
also it's really enjoyable to apply Ruby

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,450
to any of your hobbies no matter how

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,010
unrelated they might seem and then the

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,570
last learning is that it feels really

00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,700
great to take up something that you know

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,770
absolutely nothing about learning

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,600
something brand new and very different

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,370
from what you do day to day is really

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,860
humbling and challenging and it's

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,110
refreshing and it reminds you what it's

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,240
like to be a beginner which is important

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,860
to gain empathy with new programmers

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,640
that you might work with or teach or

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,590
mentor and the epilogue of this story is

00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,180
that we eventually got good enough at

00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,860
using the machine to be able to knit

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,500
full sweaters with our designs on them

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,100
and here is a Doge sweater which I also

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,100
brought today

00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:17,440
and lastly I would love to talk to you

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,720
about ideas if you care about hardware

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,850
hacking combining code with art and

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,140
about CS education thank you for

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,380
listening and thank you so much for

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,380
having me

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,770
