Description: 
	Unlocking Economic Participation for Millions of Women

How fixing the world’s broken financaial system can change the lives of marginalized women.

Women all over the world are, on average, awesome at money—they save, pay back loans, and make good financial decisions. However, structural inequalities prevent women from participating fully in the global economy.
Women are significantly less able access to economic services that let them independently better their own lives, as systemic barriers exclude them from formal financial systems.

Stellar.org's Eva Gantz will explore how an open financial network for the world can help fix this. Learn how you can help change the future of women & money.

I'm Eva gantz and I lead global

00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,369
community at a nonprofit called stellar

00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,960
org and I've been fortunate enough to

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,320
devote the last year full-time working

00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,910
on economic empowerment through

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,370
technology and I'm also a freelance

00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,079
writer on the intersections of tech and

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,890
social justice so I'm especially excited

00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:42,039
to be here today so today I'm excited to

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,859
talk to you about how we can unlock the

00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:48,639
future of women and money and unlock the

00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:51,639
future for millions of women together so

00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:54,699
i can remember wanting to go to college

00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:58,030
from the time I was about 11 and i was

00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:59,949
literally counting down the days and I

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,319
my home was never very financially

00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:04,989
secure but I knew that if I could just

00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:08,649
make it to 18 and get myself to

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:10,299
university I would be okay and I didn't

00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:13,390
worry so much about the academics is

00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:15,100
getting into college but I did worry how

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,340
on earth I was going to pay for all of

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,859
this so I did worry how I was going to

00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,930
pay for it because I didn't have a trust

00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:25,780
fund and I didn't even really have a

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,609
piggy bank fund but luckily for me I

00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,070
grew up in the United States and I was

00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:35,259
able to apply for and receive a student

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:37,329
loan and here in the US our perspective

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:40,030
on debt skews tends to skew a bit

00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:42,450
negative and pictured here are just some

00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:46,689
quotes about debt and how terrible it is

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,520
and our protected tends to see it as

00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:52,509
predatory and something that causes a

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,570
lot of anxiety but if you take a look at

00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:57,159
how access to credit is restricted in

00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,039
various communities all around the world

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,560
including here in the US the opportunity

00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,679
to get a loan is actually an opportunity

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,569
to independently better your own life so

00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:09,310
I'm not going to say that when i look at

00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:13,030
my negative account balance i'm happy

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,990
about it but I do feel grateful because

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,580
yes I worked

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,080
hard to get my degree I worked hard to

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,760
get the loan and I'm working hard now to

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:24,640
pay it off but my counterpart in a lower

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,590
income community a woman who wants

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,930
nothing more than to get to university

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,330
and independently improve her life she

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,160
doesn't get that chance today for

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,830
instance a woman named George a nanashi

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,550
pie at 22 dreamed of going to university

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,410
and becoming a teacher and I'm working

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,440
with stellar org because I believe that

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:47,350
all of us together can help make the

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,440
financial landscape fairer for people

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,940
like Georgina and others like her so

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,980
right now there are two billion people

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,130
around the world exactly like Georgina

00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:00,220
without access to services like credit

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,400
and even a bank account that many of us

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,190
here probably tend to take for granted

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,890
in fact in Detroit there are one in five

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,350
families who don't have any kind of

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,020
formal financial services and Detroit is

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:18,250
the second highest rate of unbanked in

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:21,070
the whole us so if you don't have a

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,620
credit history this means that you are

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,360
basically invisible in the formal

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,490
financial world you can't go to school

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,320
you can't buy a house you definitely

00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,980
can't start a business so you're

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,690
invisible and you're stuck so if there's

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,610
two billion people in this situation

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,000
around the world why should we focus

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,650
particularly on women today I want to

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,990
talk about how women interact with the

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,970
larger global economy innovative hacks

00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,670
that communities are using to bolster

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,250
women success and most importantly how

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,340
all of us can help change that future

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,960
together so I'm going to make a few

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,360
claims here and I want to be clear that

00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,180
these are well-researched claims backed

00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,980
by data and respectable sources there

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,990
are sources listed on the slides but I'm

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,670
also happy to elaborate on the studies

00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:13,060
more if you have questions so that said

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:16,180
women are awesome with money and by that

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,000
I mean that when women do have financial

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,190
decision-making power they tend to be

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,900
really good savers and even low-income

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,120
women and women who don't have a lot of

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,890
steadiness and their finances tend to

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,670
squirrel away at least ten to twenty

00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,790
percent

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,650
their earnings and women are also a

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,550
safer bet for lenders because they tend

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:38,110
to repay loans more reliably they're

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,360
also more likely to make equitable

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,610
decisions for their families and what I

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,290
mean by that is a woman choosing to send

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,630
both her son and her daughter to school

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,000
regardless of the perceived difference

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,920
in earning potentials and as you might

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,160
imagine this results in more opportunity

00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,350
for the entire family women are also

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,620
more likely to invest earnings that they

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,720
do make back into their families but

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,730
women's financial acumen is actually in

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,250
spite of the current financial structure

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,960
so I want to talk about some of the ways

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,740
that women are held back in the global

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,320
economy they're far less likely to have

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,000
access to credit and twenty percent less

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,660
likely to have a bank account regardless

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,940
of other factors across the board so

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,430
even in formal finance is also limited

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,520
for women for instance in Kenya forty

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,140
percent of small farms are run by women

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,680
but they get about ten percent of the

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,390
small loans this is old quote that

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,000
Ginger Rogers did everything Fred

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,970
Astaire did but she did it backwards and

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,740
in high heels when it comes to the

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,710
global economy women are dancing

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,180
backwards in high heels so they're

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,370
basically succeeding in spite of

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,660
restrictions imposed on them so let's

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,460
take a look at what that actually looks

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,780
like what i mean by dancing in high

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,860
heels in a global economic sense so i'm

00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,810
going to run through a couple of the

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,910
most widespread barriers don't feel like

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,620
you have to remember them all just try

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:05,740
to imagine what would happen if all of

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,910
these things were stacked against you so

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,530
we're going to often need a male

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:12,040
relatives permission to even open

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,960
account and oftentimes the account

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,780
that's opened actually isn't ever used

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,940
by the woman so this is true with fifty

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:23,260
to seventy percent of loans on the books

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:25,840
in pakistan for women women also

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,940
frequently don't have land owning rights

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,610
so in terms of putting up collateral to

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,580
get a loan they're frequently not able

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,190
to do so and this is true in Burkina

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:39,190
Faso Nigeria and Zimbabwe just to name a

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,320
couple of countries women also tend to

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,760
have limited mobility rights

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,950
and you may have heard that this is true

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,750
in Saudi Arabia with women driving but

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,480
there was also a recent incident in the

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,150
United Kingdom where women in a small

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,500
religious sect in North London were not

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,280
able to drive their children to school

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,110
and this was in 2015 so all around the

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,970
world there is consistent lack of

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,500
mobility so if you can't even get to a

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,800
bank account you certainly can't open

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,890
one women also tend to not have formal

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,720
IDs as frequently as men do all around

00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,900
the world and again if you don't have

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,310
some kind of verifiable identity it's

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:19,650
near impossible to get a formal

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:22,090
financial service women also just face

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,660
greater challenges in getting education

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:27,720
all over the world and one of the most

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,860
insidious but least talked about

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,650
obstacles to finance for women is

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,150
domestic financial abuse and just to

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,790
give you an idea of how prevalent this

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,340
is one in three women around the world

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,760
will experience emotional abuse from a

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,920
partner and ninety-eight percent of

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,350
those relationships will experience

00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,300
financial abuse and that just means

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,730
withholding access to a bank account

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,040
forbidding someone to open an account

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:55,690
restricting access to money and this

00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,940
kind of restriction can have devastating

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:00,220
consequences on a woman and her whole

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:03,670
family including the ability to leave

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:06,100
that toxic relationship so all these

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:09,130
stacked factors stacked together mean

00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:12,820
that women simply can't access formal

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:15,160
finances often but i believe the women

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,800
can have access and i'm definitely not

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,630
alone communities all over the world are

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,190
figuring out these innovative ways to

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,580
get around the formal finance

00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:27,460
restrictions for women and one such way

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,410
is called microfinance raise your hand

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,620
if you've heard of microfinance oh wow

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:35,110
awesome okay cool so I'll skip a lot of

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,390
the education but as a refresher it

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,760
basically just means lending in smaller

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,190
than traditionally thought of amounts

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,780
for entrepreneurs and these are

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,260
typically easier to get than a

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,360
traditional loan so a little history

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,820
micro-fine had started with dr. Muhammad

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,180
Yunus in a Bangladeshi village where he

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,420
started experimenting with lending

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,370
to very poor women and it ended up being

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,060
so successful that it's spread all over

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:06,000
the world so I want to share a story

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,160
about a real person a real woman who was

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,630
able to achieve a dream via micro

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,240
finance that she wouldn't have been able

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,000
to achieve without it so this is Devi

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,420
and she's 29 a proud business owner in

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,779
Nepal and Debbie took out an initial

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,120
loan of the equivalent of about 350 US

00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:26,940
dollars and with that loan she built a

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,680
thriving beauty supply shop and when

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,260
that succeeded she took out another loan

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,200
and then a third and her latest venture

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,420
is the chick business and she raises

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,020
these chicks and sells them for profit

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,190
in the market so Debbie was able to

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,920
achieve this thing that she'd always

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,050
dreamed of doing and in her own words

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,640
when a woman owns a business she's kept

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,600
in the decision-making circle of the

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:54,540
family so this is awesome but would

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,100
everyone in Debbie's village be able to

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,400
start a business if they wanted can

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,450
everyone get microcredit who needs it

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,930
data from the World Bank which suggests

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,970
that this is not the case so 160 million

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,130
people have been served by microfinance

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,260
and I want to say that that is is huge

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,209
it's amazing but if you look at it as a

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,940
fraction of the larger two billion

00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:19,230
unbanked you can see that there's still

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:22,170
a huge opportunity for growth so how can

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,180
we help solutions like microfinance that

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,310
are already happening on their own scale

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,060
faster what kind of technology can we

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:32,790
use the stellar is an open financial

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,890
network for the world that basically

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:39,990
helps solutions like microfinance scale

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:42,300
and it does this by providing free to

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:47,420
low-cost infrastructure the backend for

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:49,950
local services to build on top of so

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,200
microfinance institutions are already

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,320
getting excited about this open free

00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,490
network supported by a non-profit and

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,500
they're building software so for

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,570
instance this place in Nigeria called a

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,339
Radian a software company is building

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,690
something that makes transactions really

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,779
simple in between these different

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,590
microfinance institutions and the reason

00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,410
this is needed

00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:13,140
it's frequently these transactions take

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,030
place literally on a bus a physical bus

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,920
ride so they load up the cash drive

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,110
about 12 hours and then deliver the cash

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,720
physically so it's costly it's sometimes

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,150
even dangerous so they're really excited

00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,140
about plugging into this free open

00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:30,720
network so an open financial network in

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:34,140
itself can also help women opportune or

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,840
succeed simply just by virtue of the low

00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,120
transaction cost seamless international

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,950
payments and near instant transactions

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,540
and those benefits could be the

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:50,130
difference that helps a female own

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:52,860
business survive so we've talked a bit

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,110
about the tech area I'm sorry the social

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,370
implications of what an open network for

00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,100
money could do but what does this

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,830
actually look like what does it do and

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,930
what's under the hood and pictured here

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,490
is a pug with its head tilting cuz

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,690
that's you know that's how people

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,560
usually feel when they hear about it

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:12,150
first so under the hood stellar is the

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,600
first of its kind distributed

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:18,900
decentralized peer-to-peer network so

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,910
it's basically accessible and open and

00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,340
free for absolutely anyone to use and

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,200
you plug into it and you can transact

00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,170
with absolutely anyone else on the

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,270
network and it's instant in any currency

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,430
and free so this means that I could send

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,100
you dollars and you could receive it in

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,930
pounds in just seconds and these multi

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,760
currency transactions are powered by a

00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:42,930
peer-to-peer distributed marketplace

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,490
that's baked in at a protocol level so a

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,910
little bit of the architecture of how

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,620
the network works the base layer the

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,870
stellar network itself is made up of

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,180
these distributed to centralise nodes

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,610
that talk to each other and they all

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,340
agree on a distributed I'm sorry and

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,050
agreed upon database and they all store

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,540
this database and stay in sync with each

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,030
other via consensus algorithm called

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,740
stellar consensus protocol it's pretty

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,480
new it came out this March happy to

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,330
point you to resources on the 50-page

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,430
white paper or the graphic novel that

00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,699
explains it in sort of a more accessible

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,749
way

00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:20,810
but for now let's just say all these

00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:22,459
nodes agree with each other so that is

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,339
the stellar network and that is it

00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:27,230
everything else is an app or a service

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,709
built on top to let people interact with

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,480
the protocol so next up our gateways and

00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,430
these are entities that actually get the

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,980
money onto the network so they accept

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,199
deposits and record those digitally on

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:43,029
the network and any license money

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,680
service business can be a gateway so

00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:48,170
mobile money provider a microfinance

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,480
institution a bank accreditation they

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,959
can all join and again it's free and not

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:58,519
permissioned in any way all right

00:13:53,959 --> 00:14:00,529
clicker so the final level is users and

00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,360
services that are built on top of the

00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:04,850
network or accessing the network through

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,860
these gateways or directly from the

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:12,439
nodes and entrepreneurs local people at

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,259
local financial entrepreneurs and

00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:17,660
innovators can build their own services

00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:19,459
at a local level and this is important

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,559
because the people who are going to be

00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,790
using a financial service or any service

00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,819
for that matter should be the same

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,139
people who are building it so if you

00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:29,240
think that this architecture looks

00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:32,180
suspiciously similar to how the internet

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,069
works you would be right because we need

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,350
financial infrastructure to behave more

00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:38,750
like the Internet take a minute to

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,850
imagine all of the accessibility and

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,069
innovation that the Internet has brought

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,040
to global communication just person to

00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:50,420
person all over the world and imagine if

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,550
that could come to money so we've talked

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,439
a bit about how a stellar can help

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,889
solutions like microfinance scale to

00:14:54,439 --> 00:15:00,500
help provide not well served communities

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:04,610
with the credit but couldn't an open

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:08,959
free financial network do more yes so

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:11,839
simply put stellar unlocks potential one

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,629
such innovation that the network can

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,069
bring about is for remittances which are

00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:19,459
essentially cross-border payments

00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:23,179
person-to-person not corporate so the

00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:27,190
remittance market is 582 billion dollars

00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:29,320
in a single year and last year

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,740
we spent forty four billion just on the

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,450
fees so just fees wasted loss just

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,640
moving our own money around and these

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,160
came out of the pockets of some of the

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,440
world's most the people who need it most

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,070
people who are working and trying to

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,380
send money home to their families so our

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:50,560
co-founder of stellar org Joyce Kim

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,750
spoke at the UN on how stellar can

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,730
unlock remittances through this

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,670
peer-to-peer distributed marketplace

00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:02,310
where international payments are free

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:02,310
instant and happen at a protocol level

00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,400
stellar also can unlock savings so for

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,650
instance right now a non-profit in South

00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,570
Africa is building a wallet for young

00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,310
girls and women to save right from their

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,990
phones so we're probably familiar with

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,540
mobile money in the sense of you know

00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,570
square cash or paypal this would work

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,290
somewhat similarly but the girls could

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,820
save in local south african rand and

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,650
airtime minutes right from the same

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,630
wallet and these wallets are all free

00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:34,780
because it's also a nonprofit serving

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:37,450
them so the really cool thing about this

00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,880
is the end goal is not savings it's been

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,460
proven that women and young girls who

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,380
are able to save formerly stay in school

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,750
at least six months longer have better

00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,940
health outcomes and participate more in

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,970
the global formal economy when they grow

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:55,930
up so this isn't just about savings it's

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:57,280
about improving their whole lives one of

00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,440
the coolest things about stellar in my

00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,390
opinion is that it unlocks a network

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,160
effect so once you're plugged into the

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,720
network like the internet you're

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,640
connected with every other institution

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,650
and person on the network so keeping all

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,689
of this potential for global change in

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,520
mind what would a future with stellar

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:18,730
with an open financial network for the

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,459
world look like it looks like more

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:25,000
access to these services all around the

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:29,730
world decrease poverty and people living

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,730
longer and more self-directed lives

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,710
okay so we're going to move it right

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:42,940
along and say that you can get involved

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:45,370
by joining our communities you can build

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,530
your own app and extend access to people

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,620
who need it for your own communities and

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:54,300
