Description: 
	Unlocking Economic Participation for Millions of Women

How fixing the world’s broken financaial system can change the lives of marginalized women.

Women all over the world are, on average, awesome at money—they save, pay back loans, and make good financial decisions. However, structural inequalities prevent women from participating fully in the global economy.
Women are significantly less able access to economic services that let them independently better their own lives, as systemic barriers exclude them from formal financial systems.

Stellar.org's Eva Gantz will explore how an open financial network for the world can help fix this. Learn how you can help change the future of women & money.
