Description: 
	Invisibility Blues: On Advocacy and Activism in the Age of Kickstarter

In this presentation we discuss advocacy writing and multimedia work done through the Not Your Mama’s Gamer’s blog, podcast, Twitter, and other social media platforms, and we do so via the specific (something) of the Invisibility Blues project, from inception through funding and the early stages of production and response.

We will look at the original series of posts on the history of racist imagery in animation and the upcoming video game, Cuphead, as a catalyst for a larger project that became Invisibility Blues, a video series that looks at race and racial representation in video games. The speakers will discuss how they conceived of the Kickstarter project that is ultimately funding the series, reactions to the Kickstarter and the videos themselves, and how they see the Invisibility Blues project affecting the games community directly and indirectly.

Ethical, advocacy-focused communication is essential in a world dominated by new media and social media, and with the particular intricacies of discussing and demonstrating issues in gaming, video is imperative to engage with a medium that is relies on interactivity. It makes available the kinds of writing and inquiry that were previously inaccessible to many, and that access is a necessary action that inspires further action. As academics, we are in a unique position to make our work relevant to the communities we serve through fighting for positive social change. Through NYMG we have done and continue to do this work, creating an organic nexus between the overlapping worlds of gaming and social advocacy.

perspective we've done lots of

00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,579
interesting things was brought up some

00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:44,499
of our more recent things we just talked

to you talk about and people talk about

00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:11,380
how we flirt to do that to you it's been

00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:15,549
really fun uh but today we want to talk

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:18,430
to you about our work in digital

00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:22,710
advocacy and activism and how we have

00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:25,930
should have been thrust into this mode

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,689
we chose it and we also didn't choose it

00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,189
we wanted to talk about change we wanted

00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,189
to talk about making a difference in an

00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:37,020
industry and community that we love and

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:42,990
we ended in this place through a very

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,990
difficult Tanith like the theory

00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,480
only a little bit about the series oh

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,940
and this ability blusa is a video series

00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,080
that we started that is going to be

00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,030
looking at Grayson we're short

00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,040
presentation and video games or that is

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,030
currently looking at racing version

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,180
works and texture and video games it's a

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,870
Kickstarter project and I will talk a

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,790
little bit about how it started it

00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,040
started from what we thought was a

00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:15,810
little bit was fairly benign it started

00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,310
with a post that I had made on the on

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,100
the nine-month your website about

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:24,510
picking anything pixels and which I've

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:27,390
looked at a game that was announced at

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,820
e3 this year last year I don't contain

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,140
now at lo the National the first time in

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,000
2014 will go back to that we miss Eckman

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,990
but I wasn't specifically at the flesh

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,880
that was that was debuted play 15 and

00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:47,580
talked about the fact that the animation

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,540
was according to the developers

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:54,000
themselves inspired by the animated

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,010
shorts from Disney in the 1930s they

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,920
might see me animation daily in the

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,550
1930s you know how horribly racist a

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,530
census big work so i wrote a post that

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,720
talked about the history of this new

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,360
style of animation as well as my

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,540
personal reaction to the fleet at the

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,970
NCAA and it's really important to note

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,910
that it was definitely her personal

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,950
reaction to frame in that way and we

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:24,959
have to talk about that let's go to the

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:27,870
next slide because we all have different

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,280
associations with these kinds of content

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,680
and

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,750
the comparisons issues drawing and the

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,330
piece this is from the game cup head

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,190
machine reference this is obviously from

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,740
what did the older nation we have other

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,660
images from the older animations there's

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,830
a small on the screen and I'm sorry for

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:49,100
that but the entire piece was Frank and

00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,410
when I saw this I felt this way it

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,420
acknowledged the passion that had gone

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,620
into games the hand-drawn game for

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,980
trying to replicate techniques from the

00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:00,020
1930s it's a really cool undertaking but

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,030
with that undertaking even an interview

00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,209
when you talk to people talk to studio

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,650
in DHR there is a lot of engagement with

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,200
the school that materials with the

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:13,370
associations with it and that's what Sam

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,540
talked about it her piece that was so

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:20,299
cal no better not happen naturally

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:28,280
obscene as calling for a ban without

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:31,430
censorship of the game yes so Holly

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,940
others went out i watch this unfold

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,010
because i'm also off the person who

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,229
monitors any mentions of us that happen

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,110
to come up on-site support an like

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:45,200
reddit we both want to blog comments but

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,660
i usually do the wider checking because

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,760
of all i'm always glued to my phone and

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,200
everything else and it started very

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,890
slowly with some comments on the blog

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,539
very long comment arguing everything

00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,880
from the technicalities of the art style

00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,650
to how dare we speak out about our

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,449
feelings

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,000
cares about feelings only facts matter

00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:05,800
and the fact is this is a game and it

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,580
came can't inherently racist or anything

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,400
else Annie Turgenev art style it started

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,470
there and then it moved to reddit there

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,910
were these three threads ando three

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,360
different drives on reddit and different

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,400
subreddits within a few days and from

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,990
their Twitter and then to 14 and when he

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,639
got to 40 and it got a little scary for

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,590
me to watch what was happening because

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,870
they were starting to post stamps name

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,389
and her university affiliation and

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,630
things that they can do to maybe think

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,919
about getting fired and at the same time

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,889
a friend of mine was going through

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,260
something similar in Toronto and there

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,729
had been a campaign was undertaken a her

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,949
department received over a hundred phone

00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,960
calls about how because she had said she

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:50,289
was a feminist she shouldn't be a

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,570
university professor so it began to be

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:56,139
very concerned about this but instead of

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,570
stopping we did something else because

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,099
luckily or unluckily York however we

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,870
want to see it we were also going

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:04,030
through in our rhythmic geographical

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,820
area will start to call the flood of

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,320
biblical proportion and Alicia I

00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:13,320
remember when I flooded out of their

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:18,550
home so they crawl staying with me a

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:20,020
one-time seven um I talk to you about so

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,409
I try not to use mines because then i'll

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,639
definitely everyone well solely shaker

00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:25,960
family were actually staying with me

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,400
while we were waiting for the water to

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:33,610
recede so we kind of sat down at my

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,370
dining-room table and said what can we

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:40,199
do with this point and the answer was

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,199
let's see if we can make it worse so

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:49,690
okay so the listening food committee

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:52,479
works so we said let's do a response to

00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:57,430
the responses that we've had thus far so

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,490
we sat down and we made a video that

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,580
will

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,699
animation style not only a couple of

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:09,440
other games that had used similar styles

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:11,900
without importing with it the racism

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,340
that was inherent in the 1930s animation

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:20,330
shorts not make note that upper twenties

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:23,840
for five years we've made dozens upon

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,550
dozens of videos not an insane I've been

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,669
making videos for not robbers game

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:34,250
versus 2010-2011 so it would be just at

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:37,180
this point and with this game that it

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,940
seemed to bring a record held down right

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:44,750
so I know I was to tell you talking to

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,830
my butt because I was at her house

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,860
because we were together we were

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,360
watching all this unfold thought you

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,659
know Sam's arguments are actually being

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,090
ignored so let's go down and put the

00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:58,430
footage side by side with what we're

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,620
seeing and what we're experiencing and

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,599
she gave me a little bit of a lesson in

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,520
the older animation I wasn't as familiar

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,349
with some of these things as she was so

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,960
we said enemy love them hey let's make a

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:10,880
video let's put it together and try to

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,849
bring this back to argument or debate

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,530
rather than a series of accusations

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:18,469
about who feels what when what how

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,990
they're they're permitted to feel so we

00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:25,340
made this video we posted in two days

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,960
after the original post on jun 19th 2015

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,830
i'm just going to play a little bit of

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:35,209
footage from if i can get it near the

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:37,729
end not that way on this other game that

00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:40,110
we found coal fire chariot crazy hotel

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,529
and this was also done in a 93

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:46,490
animation but if you'll notice you have

00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:49,140
you hunted fast wordage a little bit

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,930
it's really hard to keep your videos in

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:56,670
present ahead of time so Ron struggle

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,860
bus with that I they the creators of

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,079
this game try to make something that was

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,320
a little bit different the main

00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:06,180
character here cherry is d sexualized

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,089
from some of the representations of

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,250
women and the older style animations if

00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:15,300
you can advance it just a touch to the

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,860
pictures a lot of those ideas that were

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,320
seeing some arms is troubling or have

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,360
more associations of the older animation

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,010
files here in contemporary world have

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,769
been removed or stripped away a lot of

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:28,170
the characteristics de-emphasized so

00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:31,680
that there's not as clear a correlation

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:34,140
and not as many caricatures while still

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,390
mimicking the style so we wanted to

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,130
present this game cuphead we're the

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,140
creators we're doing something really

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,399
beautiful but not engaging with some of

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,170
the things that came up and we're not

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,019
the only one to raise these objections I

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,970
skip that slide more time but other

00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,260
people have talked about it and here's

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,449
another game doing something similar

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,430
where they didn't have that conversation

00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,690
and those thoughts did go into it and

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,720
that's the point that we wanted to make

00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,459
you can pay a wash to something and you

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,079
can build something while still

00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:03,540
acknowledging that our world has changed

00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:08,910
and is hopefully continuing to change

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:10,800
with the better so at that point we got

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:16,570
very interesting because not only did

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,250
that in response to it like our hummus

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,820
11 of them along with the work that we

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:25,120
were doing and this is actually one of

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,580
the warmth of nine of the comments of a

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,410
lot of them never saw thematic day we

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:34,570
haven't been neither this would be not

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:36,280
even put a lot of things delete I mean

00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,700
anything if they were threatening mark

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:42,280
I've been archived them in a five that

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,230
we keep because that's what most of us

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,880
would work on an Internet and do this

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,910
kind of work do because in case you ever

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,660
need to submit that was somewhere we

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:55,450
need to have them and it is interesting

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,280
to watch these kinds of things happen so

00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,160
Alicia and I are not made this joke

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,140
wasn't maybe I should tell this joke and

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,850
I was there so what we do next and I was

00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,050
like yeah because it's almost kind of

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,640
like were like well that last thing that

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:12,070
you just killed what would you next is

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:15,520
he would so but the interesting thing

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:18,100
here is that in addition to the comments

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,220
that we've got that were angry and

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:24,550
threatening also got a lot of positive

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,910
reinforcement from the immunity from

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,550
game developers from game designers and

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,380
mothers dollars every day even Disney's

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,150
about you were like yes this is exactly

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,890
what we want to be paying attention to

00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,680
these are things that are interrogating

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:41,440
too long good work we want to see more

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,290
and that those are conversations that

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,960
need to be happening and so we because I

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,940
was still her house we sat down and said

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,470
what do we want to do at this point do

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,560
we want to just hope it goes away and

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,540
not deal with it or do we want to keep

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,100
doing it and I said you know

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,370
a couple of days to make that first

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,570
video we could make some more and say

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,829
I'm not just look on her face that I've

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,560
never seen before we'll probably never

00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:08,490
see again her eyes just got so big and

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,630
she said I've always wanted to do that

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,420
because I don't know what if I signed up

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:16,389
for but then I'm going to get to play

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:19,839
and that's where everything began to

00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:23,319
change and we decided because what we

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,720
needed needed your things hardware we

00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:29,560
needed software you need to have access

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,089
to more games for both of us that you

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,779
know it's while it's easier for me to do

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:37,420
because this is my research fraction

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:41,110
just haven't read that right they have

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,519
access to these past days so we had to

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,959
think about all of the things that we

00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,269
would need will begin to make a list and

00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,740
a possible budget and within that budget

00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,560
but not only include those items

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:54,670
hardware software hundreds of games but

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,230
also time because it's just us and as we

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,180
began to talk about it and as we

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,100
launched the Kickstarter soon as we had

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,500
some ideas about what kinds of themes we

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,180
might want to do you can begin to think

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,350
about what we needed we thought we've

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,339
got to crouch run this so we'll launch

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,110
we've learned it may be a little more

00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:13,899
planning before that way ever do it

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,040
again but we had a pretty solid

00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:19,420
foundation and base and we said you know

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,470
we asked for initially for forty eight

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,480
hundred dollars you said this is the

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,209
money we need to pay smaller area to get

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,949
some people to speak with us to support

00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:29,160
it other researchers maybe who would

00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:31,720
think people have specialties beyond us

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,790
beyond the things that we do and for all

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,160
of the games but we never asked pretty

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,930
support personnel and we still don't

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,410
have any everything that we do is just

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:43,149
us so that's been a challenge but not

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,459
only do we have to think and plan in

00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,810
terms of what we needed we also had to

00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:48,090
think

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,910
plan in terms of safety because we both

00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:55,170
have children we both have families and

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:57,540
pets and we've watched people swatted

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,510
Sam as experience to some of that in the

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,640
past we spent hours trying to scrub our

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,860
online profiles I put a lot of videos of

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,060
my children for extended family I had to

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,770
try to make sure that those were hidden

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,660
but could still be accessed by people

00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,550
who were not tech-savvy had to make sure

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,470
addresses you want to list it anywhere

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,360
had to think about everything that I've

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,710
ever posted on the internet for instance

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,320
that I'm very active got a lot of online

00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,900
venues I didn't think about what happens

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,810
if somebody spends 12 hours cataloging

00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,910
thinks that I said back in 2007 and how

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,040
that might impact my career because

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,600
there are people who do that just

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,680
because your dare voice an opinion about

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:38,130
a video game luckily I guess we were

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:42,660
lures no at my other two point I just

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:44,520
really didn't we hope I had also had to

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,290
go through because my mother leaves her

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,520
phone number and her address listed in

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,350
everything she's awesome and I really

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,060
didn't wanna mess myself in the phone

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,770
book so I actually had to go through

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,600
these sites and to enough only for

00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,940
myself but to do it for my mother as

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,390
well who's an old woman who lives alone

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,330
right and we've seen over and over again

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:05,700
that insane people who post these kinds

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:08,250
of things on the internet have been

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,850
calling the elderly parents of people

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,160
and making threats toward their children

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,020
and my mother talking to you forgotten

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,200
how can so I had to go through to do

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,000
this not only for myself in terms of

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,700
manually asking that my namely removed

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,660
from databases but also has made the

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:29,190
same for my mother and the other thing

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,260
that we had to do was sit down and think

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,650
about what our goal really works what do

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,600
we want to accomplish with a project

00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,339
like this and it's not enough to just

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,839
say oh we want things to change we want

00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,520
things to be different we want our

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,410
children to grow up in a more inclusive

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,350
environment because that's an amorphous

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,790
goal what do we want okay so we sat down

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,740
and talked about it what we would like

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,140
to see and this is what came about when

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,940
we talked with the game developers and

00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,650
creators and we're coming to us and

00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:00,000
saying yes many these conversations as

00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:01,800
we need more people in those rooms privy

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,780
to those discussions about right we need

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,209
somebody to stand up and say you know

00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,209
what maybe we do these engage with these

00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:11,220
ideas maybe before you include that

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:13,709
scene of sexual assault in your gaming

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,180
to think about what the impact is maybe

00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:17,640
when you're creating a character

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,560
generator you need to make sure that if

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,930
you can have people of color than those

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,079
men can maybe also have beards that

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,940
aren't long and straight and we thought

00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,310
about all of these things that we wanted

00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:32,190
to accomplish and then all came back to

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:35,579
just taking a moment to demonstrate here

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:38,280
is what we see here's what it means here

00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:40,650
are the implications that maybe people

00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,420
sitting in these rooms creating games or

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:46,260
not thinking of we need to wipe the

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:49,530
conversation and so we got funded on

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,670
august eight and we find it at two

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,900
hundred seventy percent of our original

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,900
goal so that was really nice

00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,740
and we're very very proud of that but

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,090
the hard truth is that still in ten

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:05,170
thousand dollars were making eight

00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:09,550
videos and I all ready to cut the first

00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:11,260
video which David yesterday I cut seven

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:14,770
and a half hours of footage finally at

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,720
the end down to 22 minutes we had to

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,670
learn how to create effects we had to

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,440
learn to do better sound production we

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,209
had to learn to our production quality

00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,530
because of course people already

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,089
comparing what we're doing to what I

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,490
need Sarkisian does but she has a team

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:29,230
you know she's got always future is 160

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,450
thousand dollars we raise 10 there's a

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,250
big difference there but we'd like to

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,990
show you within our remaining time to

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,180
very short clip from the video that they

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:45,190
you yesterday so you can see what we're

00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:46,960
doing and what we're about this first

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:53,680
video was she finds the place is about

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:59,650
character creation engines absolutely

00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:05,890
thank you for sure that's 17 it doesn't

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:07,900
show the tummy room and if we can find

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,430
the exact spot I mean we can surely just

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,160
take a moment to talk about what's

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,630
happening on the screen so one of the

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,430
things that we looked at we looked at

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,350
hair options never made one here is your

00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,360
creation and one of the things that we

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:22,030
saw we looked at which five or six games

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,440
for this video total we included some

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,890
footage from other games including one

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,730
that came out several years

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,800
that in which there was for instance

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,690
NPCs non-player characters who were not

00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,280
white in the game but in the character

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,230
creation engine you could only make a

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,790
white character no matter what you can

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,520
change your hair color but you can only

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,890
be the same shade of pale we talked to

00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,770
Sharif Jackson and game looks good about

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,950
beards because as I mentioned often you

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,450
cannot make characters who who have

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,160
short curly beards they have to be long

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:56,510
and straight magnificent glistening

00:18:52,160 --> 00:19:10,160
beards of your support if you get it to

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:14,630
play fairly simple at the time ten

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,460
desires hogs missing sri studies added

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,830
more facial characters characters is

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:22,040
zombies groan and the games were the

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:25,970
closest options take these 48 like at

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,710
least me and DHEA 16 she speculated it

00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,539
may be

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,299
because the athletes are most dangerous

00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:33,970
color but that doesn't mean similar

00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:37,539
options should be available in other

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:44,649
character creators well just notice

00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:46,210
something like I really like it that I

00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:48,909
just discovered problem with the video

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:51,309
over here that's great but some of the

00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:52,659
things that we noticed where that for

00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:56,049
instance and this is where we'll wrap up

00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:57,190
is that there was a lot of rhetoric that

00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:00,159
was really troubling in the law

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,289
especially fantasy games like the one

00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,940
black raised in a certain cake doesn't

00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:06,159
share blood with anybody else they're

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,230
totally separate so in some of the games

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,240
in that series was in the old roles you

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,340
could make only those characters

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,679
dark-skinned only those people in that

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,390
particular race and other ones can be

00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,649
sort of dark but when you got them dark

00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,919
but they just look like they roll in mud

00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:22,480
and it was really troubling to see these

00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,000
kinds of options because you're also

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,770
limited in your play style and a lot of

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,570
people according to our research are

00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:31,720
making characters that are idealized

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:34,029
versions of themselves what does it tell

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,529
those players if when they're making

00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:37,630
that idealized version that they can

00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:40,299
only have certain kinds of hair if they

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:43,000
can only be certain shades what's the

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:45,580
impact and one of the interesting things

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,559
that we were able to do in this first

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,360
video

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,249
and it continued to do as the videos go

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,879
on is we were able to bring together

00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:57,299
what is of academics of gamers of game

00:20:53,879 --> 00:21:01,320
designers to have this conversation in

00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:04,169
these small 20 ish minute videos that

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,909
you've seen kind of grown exponentially

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,860
already because this first video was

00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:09,960
supposed to simply a character creation

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,330
and we've already realized that this

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,999
first video is going to copy video 1.1

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,769
1.2 and 1.3 and I way I wanted to cover

00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:19,139
all the things that we wanted to cover

00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:22,080
so we find ourselves there ok we're

00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:24,169
going to make a video now we're okay so

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,179
it's going to get more and more full of

00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:28,679
honor but I think that we're going to

00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:33,049
manage the juicing good and that's what

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,049
we're here for thank you

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,940
