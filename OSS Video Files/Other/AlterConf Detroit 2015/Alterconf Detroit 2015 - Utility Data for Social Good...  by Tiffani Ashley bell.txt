so yes I'm Tiffany Ashley Bell the

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,910
executive director and founder of the

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:33,170
Detroit water project um so essentially

00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,520
last year I read about how 100,000

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,710
people here in Detroit robots have to

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,879
experience life without running water if

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,560
you live here you're part of your

00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:42,710
probably aren't very familiar with this

00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:47,090
but this is lateeya lateeya is a single

00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:49,160
grandmother here in Detroit and she has

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,160
been a caretaker here for the last 14

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,260
years or so she's raised he's a

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,790
grandmother and stuff like that but this

00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,070
time last year she had to go in medical

00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,649
leave Susan health issues and stuff like

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,170
that and that be all fine except for

00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:05,930
this was unpaid medical leave and she

00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:09,110
had grandkids she had to take care of in

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,969
addition to three other kids that were

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,700
not hers that she adopted because her

00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:15,259
best friend died and so because she

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,639
couldn't you know she wasn't paid for a

00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:19,819
medical leave and stuff like that she

00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:22,130
couldn't afford rent or basic utilities

00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:24,319
like water but it turns out though that

00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,899
over 35 million other households in the

00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:30,319
united states experienced the same thing

00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:31,579
where people have problems pretty much

00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,529
to understanding how their to afford

00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:37,130
their water bills and utility bills from

00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:38,539
one from from one month the next and i

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,920
found out about this like i said last

00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:42,529
year is a Code for America fellow

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,999
working with the city of Atlanta on open

00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:46,520
data and procurement but I read about

00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:47,840
this in the Atlantic with people here in

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,090
Detroit having to deal with how they're

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,679
going to pay the water bill when they

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,740
don't have jobs and things of that sort

00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:56,329
and the city was not exactly doing much

00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,369
to help people out with that sort of

00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,479
thing I thought that's pretty crappy you

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,249
considering i was walking around in

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,380
atlanta city hall that time and just saw

00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:04,969
the workings of city hall and what they

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,189
thought of people and policy and stuff

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:09,440
like that now that was pretty shady that

00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:11,180
a city-run water company is able to just

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,430
turn people off without considering that

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,410
this is a single mother without a job or

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,210
this is someone who is on disability and

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,630
can't afford the water bill and they

00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,290
weren't trying to help people

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,180
really and truly um so I wasn't exactly

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,500
content to just sit there and just be

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,200
like oh that's so sad and not doing

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,270
anything about it pretty much a very

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,650
action-oriented person programmer by

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,340
training and stuff like that so I want

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,320
to build and actually do things and so I

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,060
do my normally do when I'm outraged

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,490
about something I usually go to just go

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,560
to Twitter and this time I asked what

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,920
people here Dave and I didn't have water

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,920
and other answers really were moving to

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,230
me so my co-founder at the time she said

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,460
I would help she helped someone with a

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,470
water bill if i could pay that bill

00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,270
directly for them and i didn't really

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,880
know what that meant at the time but

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,580
what we turn it into in four short hours

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,460
that same night that we read about the

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,840
story was the detroit water project it

00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,900
went from being this really really Jenky

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,640
website here toward it is now but we

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,980
built this in four short hours just

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,390
using bootstrap and Heroku and a bunch

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,090
of other free services like github and

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,950
stuff like that and the goal was to find

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,320
people who needed help with their water

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,940
bills and match them to folks all around

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,100
the world who wanted to just give five

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,660
dollars 500-dollars whatever they could

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,860
afford to help people with their bills

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,330
here and it was not based on you know

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,220
like there being any sort of overly

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,840
special or tight considerations for

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,160
through usual social service programs

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,110
and stuff like that we just want to help

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,230
folks and get their water turn back on

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,280
as soon as we possibly could so I'll

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,950
explain a little bit more like how it

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,600
works a little bit later but essentially

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,459
we match people who need help with their

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,470
water bills to people all around the

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,400
world who want to help which is five

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,890
bucks or whatever they can actually

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,450
afford and we ended up giving this money

00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,370
directly to the utility company on their

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,320
behalf and getting their water turn back

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,680
on or preventing it from being turned

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,030
off in the first place and so since you

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,800
live last year we've paid over two

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,160
hundred thirty grand and water bills to

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,900
Detroit and Baltimore just from regular

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,240
people giving whatever they could to

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,640
help over nine hundred families there to

00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:22,570
either oh

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,310
thank you thank you thanks just out

00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,760
folks out regular people helping regular

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,530
people and again in Baltimore we've

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,260
saved over 40 houses from waterville

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,420
foreclosure just since februari and

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,470
launching there because again and we

00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,940
didn't know any of this stuff when we

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,740
started but you can actually lose your

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,720
house and your kids over your water bill

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,030
and I was pretty surprised and again

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,640
discussed it and a lot of cursing and I

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,990
found that out um but it's just it's

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,190
pretty crazy some of the stuff that goes

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,990
on behind this but a lot of what we've

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,570
amassed is a bunch of data about people

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,450
and their situations and especially like

00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,070
their utility data so we want to do with

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,750
that it's just to design targeted

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,760
interventions for people over time and

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,250
help them avoid being in this situation

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,750
in the future and as a lot of people

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,160
come to us with different reasons for

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,990
why they need the assistance so some

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,550
people may have had a leak that they

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,580
couldn't afford that sudden spike in the

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,570
bill or some people long-term hadn't

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,430
been paying the bill because they didn't

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,460
have a money the money to she didn't

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,020
have a job to pay that bill and we think

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,460
that they're different since there are

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,320
different root causes for why people

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,540
don't pay we think that they should all

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,640
be addressed differently so over time

00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,580
it's not the goal is to just keep paying

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,720
bills and hope for the best for people

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,940
but we want to use the data that we have

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,890
to match people to local community

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,620
organizations to help them with things

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,780
like employment foreclosure prevention

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,820
legal aid and you know leak repairs and

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,850
stuff like that i mentioned legal aid

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,140
because we found out that some people

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,360
they were paying a utility bill to their

00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,100
landlord the landlord wasn't actually

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,050
paying the bill but they ended up with

00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,050
the shutoff notice ironically and so

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,030
that calls for legal aid but we also

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,650
want to just use like common sense of

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,020
course data science to help utility

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,280
companies identify people beforehand I

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,800
mean I've had a conversation with the

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,240
water department director here actually

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,950
around the same time last year and she

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
claims she didn't know who these people

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,730
were ahead of time which I want to be

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,470
polite and not say certain things but

00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:22,600
Joe Biden calls that malarkey um

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,100
you know and because we've seen these

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,259
things we see in people's data the

00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,060
patterns that says you know this person

00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,130
was paying consistently until six months

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,110
ago what happened we could reach out to

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,910
them and when you see those sorts of

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,520
patterns and just say how are you what's

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:40,360
going on and stuff like that we want to

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,220
do that for utility companies and so but

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,770
if you live here in Detroit this is

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,660
probably familiar this is the water

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,060
department website so what we do when

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,530
someone applies is we take this we

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,229
actually go and we take their account

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,120
number and we scrape all this data from

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:57,550
the utility company website and we use

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,560
that to sort of analyze whether or not

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,539
they need help and like when you know

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,190
like I was saying before your payment

00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:04,780
pattern suggested they may have needed

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,580
help because I'm people they'll do

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,990
things like make partial payments when

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,639
their bills a certain amount or whatever

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,139
and we can sniff all that sort of stuff

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,710
out and actually determine if they need

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:16,060
the help or not and so we do that and

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,160
luckily I was a math minor in college

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,430
and continue this is a computer science

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,349
major it's so like this is some of my ax

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,090
my math from around Christmas last year

00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,760
but this is what we use to pretty much

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,849
help people get really really fast

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,610
decisions this is not foolproof and so

00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:34,389
when someone is denied for example we'll

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,909
go and we'll look at the application

00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:41,050
ourselves and just say is this actual

00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:42,789
case of neat or not and this is actually

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:47,650
the obligatory it works squeem

00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:49,180
screenshot um pada yeah and so I mean

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,560
one of the more interesting and more

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,300
important things to me know about all

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,370
this data is just using this to sort of

00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:58,060
spur people to advocate for themselves

00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:00,370
and to drive change because one of the

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,900
more interesting things is that I I

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,340
didn't know this when we first started

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,870
but there's just so much public policy

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,000
that's wrapped around utilities and it's

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,620
kind of obvious in retrospect but just

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,030
like some of the effects are crazy like

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,000
i was saying people losing their kids

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,380
and their houses or water bills but i

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,630
want to use some of the data that we

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,979
have and find ways to anonymize it and

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,479
things like that and show that to people

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:23,860
and help them advocate for themselves

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:26,380
and so and at help them ask questions of

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,700
their leaders here and so one of the

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,130
things I talk a lot about is

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,660
this map here and this is actually from

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,290
this is the older map of ours from

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:40,550
around earlier this year like january or

00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:42,350
something like that and but in july here

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,810
the detroit city council approved seven

00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:48,410
a percent rate increase in water bills

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,910
and i was curious of those City Council

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,950
members that voted yes for that rate

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,770
increase how many of them had

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:57,200
constituents in our program where those

00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:00,160
people needed help and so what you're

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,870
seeing here is this a very rough map of

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,790
the most dense areas for example or

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,990
where those City Council members

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,610
actually voted yes for the rate

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,680
increases and it's kind of like why

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,030
we've never made this map public because

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,890
a lot of like clean up we have to do

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,230
around it but it's just a question I

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,670
want to help people here ask and have

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,860
them go to their City Council members

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,810
and just say here's this map these are

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,240
all my neighbors in your district why

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,160
are you raising rates like why does this

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,990
make sense and of course they say things

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,340
like we need to you know protect the

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,110
financial situation of the city and

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,430
stuff like that which makes sense but

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,920
you're doing it off the backs of people

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,920
that already can't afford bills as it is

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,120
and so what are you propose to do when

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,240
you have this many of your constituents

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,160
in areas that can't pay the bills and

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,740
it's always think it's interesting how

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,420
in these two areas like these two

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,650
council members voted no against the

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:53,120
rate increases they don't have as many

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:55,340
people as these other folks do but again

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,590
like the goal is to not keep paying

00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,720
bills it's just too that's a stopgap

00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,420
measure to help people that need to help

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,790
right away or to help them in the future

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,040
but going forward what I want for this

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,870
is just like legislation nationally or a

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,730
state level or wherever it needs to

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,710
happen to prevent people from being shut

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,990
off whether its water or electricity or

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:17,090
whatever it is but mostly water in our

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,650
case if they can prove financial

00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,720
hardship these are not folks that like

00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,860
take their utility money and go shopping

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,450
and things like that these are folks

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,970
that actually don't have it as it is in

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,740
the first place we want protections for

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,390
them to be able to say like I am

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,880
actually experiencing financial hardship

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,020
do not turn me off because there are

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,730
folks that we've encountered that a lid

00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,680
for like a year or more without running

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,850
water in their houses and I met people

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,460
in Baltimore that don't have either

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,450
water or electricity we're talking about

00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,130
2014 2015

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,420
nited states of america so-called

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,370
superpower wealthiest country in the

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,640
world yadda yadda yadda folks are living

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,680
like this and I think we can I know we

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,590
can do better as a country so I want

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,650
this kind of thing in place but i'll

00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,880
leave you with this i'm actually i think

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,880
LBJ is a kind of a funny president he's

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,260
always stayed over people but i think um

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,790
he talks about the great society and

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,280
sort of the war and poverty from way

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,170
back when but there's this quota found

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,330
from his Great Society speech that talks

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,220
about poverty and how to solve these

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,900
sorts of things and the kind of thing

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,580
that's necessary so he says the solution

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,740
to these problems and that's poverty is

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,450
talking about does not rest on a master

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,370
program in Washington nor can it relies

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,170
solely on the strained resources of

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,230
local authority they require us to

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,400
create a new concept of cooperation a

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,050
creative federalism between the national

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,850
capital and leaders of local communities

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,470
and I think that what we're doing here

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,510
is just an example of how that can

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,650
happen and sort of you know greasing the

00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,780
wheels for people to advocate for

00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,750
themselves and work together to prevent

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,430
sort of the end results of poverty like

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,460
people living without running water and

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,580
electricity and when they when they go

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,930
to work and they have issues that they

00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,820
everybody deserves water if you ask me

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,040
so human right viously their folks that

00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,300
really disagree with that and I don't

00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,610
really care to hear from them sometimes

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,770
but and I don't mean it that way but I

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,330
think of it as even if you don't think

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,670
that water is a human right it's a

00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:09,300
biological need so that should protect

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:12,300
itself and so I just think that this is

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,640
a nice way of thinking about that but I

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,380
mean going forward I would ask that you

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,390
know don't just say oh this is cool

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,980
that's nice that you did that but you

00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,160
actually give five or six dollars

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,720
whatever you can and help someone out or

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,420
volunteer we always did like legal help

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,090
or people to talk to people that call us

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,590
for assistance or whatever or just even

00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,060
happen if you're a developer we always

00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,010
need development talent that's reliable

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,390
and commit it to help us out and even

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,280
some of those opportunities or paint as

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,230
a matter of fact so you know go to

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,970
Detroit water project org and you can

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,970
help out that way so thank you

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,470
