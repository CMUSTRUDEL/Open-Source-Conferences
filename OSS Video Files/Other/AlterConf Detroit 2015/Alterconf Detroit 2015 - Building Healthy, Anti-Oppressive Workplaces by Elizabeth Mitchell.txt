	Building Healthy, Anti-Oppressive Workplaces 

Remote work and flexible schedules are a privilege of the tech world. Removing the expectation of everyone working the same hours and allowing workers to choose the times they can best contribute can promote a healthier workplace. Remote work and flexible work both have the potential to remove many of the barriers associated with stricter work environments. This helps people with physical and mental disabilities, caregivers, and others have greater flexibility to feel comfortable contributing meaningful work. But building a healthy, flexible workplace also demands shifting the culture to acknowledge how biases and oppressions intersect with how we view and treat others in the workplace. I will discuss how having a flexible, remote schedule and teammates willing to work together through biases helped me make it through a difficult year and find joy in my career.
