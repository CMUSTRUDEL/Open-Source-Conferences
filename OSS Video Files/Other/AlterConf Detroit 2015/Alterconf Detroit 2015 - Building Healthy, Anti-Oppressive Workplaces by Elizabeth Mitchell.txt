Description: 
	Building Healthy, Anti-Oppressive Workplaces 

Remote work and flexible schedules are a privilege of the tech world. Removing the expectation of everyone working the same hours and allowing workers to choose the times they can best contribute can promote a healthier workplace. Remote work and flexible work both have the potential to remove many of the barriers associated with stricter work environments. This helps people with physical and mental disabilities, caregivers, and others have greater flexibility to feel comfortable contributing meaningful work. But building a healthy, flexible workplace also demands shifting the culture to acknowledge how biases and oppressions intersect with how we view and treat others in the workplace. I will discuss how having a flexible, remote schedule and teammates willing to work together through biases helped me make it through a difficult year and find joy in my career.

hi my name is Elizabeth Mitchell I'm

00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,500
originally from Detroit and I'm a

00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,870
developer and worker owner at sassafras

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,250
tech collective and I'll talk a little

00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,350
bit more about them later but they're a

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,140
small worker cooperative based in Ann

00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,540
Arbor and i've been pursuing web

00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,000
development as a career for about two

00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,280
and a half years and today i'll be

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,090
sharing with you my experiences related

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,400
to diversity in the workplace so let's

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:48,590
start by silently reflecting for a

00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:54,170
moment imagine a time when you hit parts

00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:57,920
of yourself where were you and who was

00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,320
around you at that time and how did you

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,469
feel so just think about the time where

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,120
you weren't yourself and it was because

00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:06,229
the people around you didn't make you

00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,000
feel like you could comfortably be

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:12,860
yourself in that space okay now think of

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,900
a time where you felt at ease and

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,479
comfortable about who you were or who

00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,030
you are this can be from your parent or

00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:26,270
your past and what does that place look

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:28,670
like not advancing Indian okay um what

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,960
does that place look like and who's

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,520
there and how does it how does it feel

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,869
okay so thanks for thinking about these

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,570
questions and we'll come back to them a

00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:43,960
little bit later so at one of my

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:46,340
earliest tech jobs um I worked at a

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,640
development shop in berkeley michigan

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,020
which is a suburb of detroit and it was

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,750
one of the most diverse teams that have

00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,400
ever worked with the group represented

00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,189
individuals from many nationalities and

00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,390
ethnicities and the owner brought on

00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,820
people who he thought were bright and

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,369
good at coding and i think he was an

00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,470
asian american business owner and i

00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:08,209
think it was important to him to bring

00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,739
on people who had been excluded from

00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,200
technology careers based on their

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,660
identity

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,510
and with each new hire that they were

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:20,040
bringing on it was improving his age and

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:21,750
gender and racial diversity so despite

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,000
the diversity of this team this was the

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,319
first and only time I've experienced a

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,720
vers racism in a place of employment so

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,030
I'm gonna talk a little bit about that

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,190
um one of my co-workers use violent

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,650
language that specifically targeted

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,720
african-americans am on three separate

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,480
occasions the first two times were

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,310
racial slurs and then the last time

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,000
happened during the work day in front of

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,160
everybody in my workplace and she was

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,450
discussing a recent purchase of a

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,560
handgun um in relation to a neighbor who

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,110
made her feel uncomfortable and the

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,760
neighbor happened to be black and she

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,230
also shared that she found it hard to

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,480
distinguish between her neighbors

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,489
because in her words all black people

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:11,099
look alike um my coworker who lived in

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,660
the same city that I did which is a

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,519
racially ethnically diverse community in

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,220
Metro Detroit she couldn't see the

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,810
differences between her black neighbors

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,350
because she wasn't seeing those people

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,660
as whole people racism clouds a person's

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,600
ability to see each individual person as

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:31,019
a whole person rather than a caricature

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,970
or a mono lift and Toni Morrison writes

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,819
that oppressive language does more than

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,680
represent violence it is violence it

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,250
does more than represent the limits of

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,410
knowledge its limits knowledge so in

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,079
encountering moments of oppression I'm

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,359
part of me wants to respond with what

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:51,239
which is from despicable me or

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:54,480
ridiculous which is a spell from harry

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,700
potter um but you can't laugh off

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,730
discrimination and violence or wish it

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,359
away my co-workers willingness to use a

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:05,340
weapon in a violent way against a people

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,919
group indiscriminately based on their

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,569
identity was extremely violent and to

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,989
experience that type of violence in the

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,030
workplace was extremely frightening um

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:17,099
and you can't shake off that person's

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,359
words and never see that person again

00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:20,700
you could do that if it was someone on

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,820
the street but it's not possible to do

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,160
that at work this is the person that

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,580
you sit across from or that you share a

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,170
room with on a regular basis so when we

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,750
continually tolerate this sort of

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,820
violence in the workplace in this type

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,660
of language what it does is it creates

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,800
conditions for unhealthy workplaces it

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,660
impacts not just the people groups who

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,940
are targeted or talked about but

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,700
everyone else in the room regardless of

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,500
identity and people of color women of

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,450
all races and ethnicities and other

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,240
marginalized groups face a lot of

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,920
discrimination on a day-to-day basis and

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,190
tech culture is just a small subset of

00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,620
that like we face it both at work and in

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,910
our day-to-day lives and so when we got

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,530
to work we don't want to be in

00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,010
workplaces were reviewed as a character

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,270
and not seen as a whole person and we

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,670
don't want to come to work to experience

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,650
discrimination and oppression no matter

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,590
how subtle or overt that discrimination

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,230
might be in the long term places that

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,820
tolerate and exacerbate discrimination

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:28,290
they just won't be places where people

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:30,120
can sustainably remain so here's what

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,990
I've learned from working in different

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,520
workplaces in tech and it's from places

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,770
where I thrived at and places where I

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,960
felt uncomfortable people cannot

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:43,290
contribute their best if they are

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,000
wearing masks and each individual each

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,860
of us is responsible for trying to

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,070
remove the masks that we hold in our

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,410
workplaces and employers have a

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,050
responsibility to promote places that

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:59,490
are not oppressive where people are

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:02,490
allowed to be there wholesales so what

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,650
does it mean to wear a mask at work it

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,600
means that the part of you the parts of

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,910
you that you cherish about yourself are

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,340
things you feel you must hide or

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,070
suppress if you happen to be Muslim or

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,410
Christian or Puerto Rican or black these

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,580
parts of yourself are parts of your

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,710
identity that you don't need to feel

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,210
ashamed of and if you work in an

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,000
environment that makes you feel less

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,290
than because of your identity it's a

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,330
place where you're not allowed to be

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:30,630
your whole self you are wearing masks at

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:32,790
that point additionally you may be

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,280
wearing a mask if you have flaws or

00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,710
weaknesses that you feel that you need

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,240
to hide

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,730
or that if you have particular needs

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,110
that you don't speak up about you had

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,700
those things because you see them as

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,730
vulnerable ax t because they might be

00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,290
made fun of or might be exploited in the

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,500
workplace if that's happening you may

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,700
also be wearing a mask at work um so

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,790
let's think back to the beginning of

00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,040
this talk I asked you to think about a

00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,140
time where you might been hiding parts

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,860
of who you were when you were wearing a

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:06,410
mask so I'm asking to you all I'm only

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,420
can take a few responses how does it

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,420
feel to wear a mask at work how does it

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,920
feel to hide parts of yourself so one

00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,800
person said that it's scary because

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,920
you're you're worried that you might it

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,540
might be uncovered um another person

00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,490
said that being discovered may make it

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,870
so that you aren't being your best self

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,200
because you're so concerned about that

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,490
anybody else it also may mean that you

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,620
might not feel like you're good enough

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:34,010
in the workplace because you're worried

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,570
about being discovered as well um and

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,640
this person said that it's tiring and a

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,380
distraction and that you're you're

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,480
spending so much energy investing into

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:45,170
keeping up a mask and one more this last

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,560
one um it also can be limiting because

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:52,150
it you're you're not showing your mask

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:56,690
at that point seven I'm sorry I did it

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,580
alright so we're gonna move on so what

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,550
does it mean to bring your whole self to

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,260
work it means that you're bringing all

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,510
of that you are to the work you do it

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,040
includes your identity your strengths or

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:11,540
weaknesses the parts of you that you

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:14,720
cherish in your quirks so how does it

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:18,950
feel to bring your whole self to work um

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,020
a few more responses I can't share all

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,000
of what you said but but just that

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,260
you're more at ease when you're able to

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,770
be yourself when you're able to share

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,510
that you can build trust and actually be

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,850
genuine the communication that you're

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,610
sharing with other people anyone else

00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,860
and I guess what I'm from that is just

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,140
being able to share the parts of you

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,000
that you are it might be your weirdness

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,100
or whatever that gives you the courage

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,080
to keep being whoever it is that you are

00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:48,470
in the workplace okay I'm going to move

00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,260
on but I really appreciate that so I

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,300
currently work for a small company

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,630
caught sassafras tech collective which

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,520
is a worker cooperative a worker co-op

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,000
is a business that is democratically

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,550
owned by its workers and I think what

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,800
that means in terms of culture is that

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,480
each individual person even the people

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,070
who aren't worker owners at this point

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,560
they're just prospective members of our

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,650
group who are considering being owners

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,780
at up at some point each individual has

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:20,620
the opportunity to impact and shape the

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,450
culture of the workplace so sassafras is

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,640
not the most diverse company but

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:31,510
inclusion matters anti-oppression is

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,730
being actively um its anti-oppression

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,070
and also being actively welcoming to

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,320
marginalized groups is built into our

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,690
structure in terms of like what our

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,970
goals are and how we go about hiring

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,070
that's an important part an important

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,840
component of our company and there is a

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,020
there's conflict like there's going to

00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,030
be conflict everywhere regardless of how

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,860
comfortable the environment is people

00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,080
cause conflict with each other so

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,730
there's conflict but each person is

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,680
aware of their own privilege and how

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,160
that relates to how they interact with

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,500
people at work and when someone's words

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,820
and actions cause harm something I've

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,080
never been able to do before in any

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,360
workplaces I can talk to that person

00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,690
directly and say hey you said something

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,270
and it hurt let's talk about this um and

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,770
also we're able to when there's a moment

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,750
when someone says something that might

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,660
be oppressive or counterproductive to

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,070
save space we talk to that person so one

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,810
person will go to the person say hey

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,400
this might make other people in our

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,560
group feel uncomfortable we need to talk

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,820
this through and that's that's a pretty

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,430
amazing thing to do to be able to

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,380
communicate moments of oppression and

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,300
actually have a solid real conversation

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,950
with someone about it and it's an

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,410
imperfect place with imperfect people

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,960
and their whole and beautiful and I love

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,730
working there so before working at

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,340
sassafras I worked on a team consisting

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:52,210
of all white men and me a black woman

00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,590
and I wore a mask most of the time and I

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,150
laughed at things that were

00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,500
inappropriate and that made me feel

00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,720
uncomfortable just so that I could fit

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,250
in and the environment was one where

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,110
people's identities and flaws were used

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,300
for humor which is wasn't

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,190
healthy and so I worked really really

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,339
hard they're trying to prove my worth in

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,680
a place where I was not welcome so this

00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,120
past January while working at sassafras

00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,070
part-time and then working at that other

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,220
company full time I started to get

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,870
really sick so I would be really dizzy

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,930
and tired and I didn't know what was

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,760
going on um and it started to impact my

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,290
mental health so I started like it was

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,730
like my brain was breaking down so I was

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,380
getting like really bad anxiety and

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,899
depression while being very ill at the

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,630
same time and so one day was so bad that

00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:37,720
at the other workplace i was at i had to

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:40,730
tell my boss hey I'm gonna go home and

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,670
in that moment I had the most honest

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,050
conversation I had had ever with that

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,940
boss even though I had worked there for

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:50,810
months and it was because at that moment

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:53,870
where my with you know my being like not

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:57,709
well my body finding was like hey you

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,660
don't have time for mast um so I decided

00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:01,550
to join sassafras full time around that

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,050
same time and during that time I was

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,329
still going through some really

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,490
difficult health challenges but despite

00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:10,820
these how challenges what made it really

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,160
easy um what made it easier for me not

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,990
super easy but was to just have remote

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,570
and flexible work and also really

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,699
understanding co-workers so there have

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,320
been days where I felt too dizzy or

00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,600
physically exhausted to go about normal

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,290
daily activities my mom was alert but my

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,519
body was exhausted and so I would depend

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,110
on how i was feeling I would work from

00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,899
the couch i work from bed i would work

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,610
for my office at home and having remote

00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:37,190
work allowed me to contribute meaningful

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:41,990
work while being aware of and responsive

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:44,329
to my physical limitations so remote

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,600
work the slides are going to work some

00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:50,570
remote work is the ability to perform

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,170
your work from a place other than your

00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,850
employer's primary location so the and

00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,380
then the definition that i have for

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,829
flexible work is the ability to perform

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:03,709
your work at a flexible time of the day

00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:05,570
or night so some of the things that are

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:07,699
beneficial about flexible work are that

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:11,060
they allow people to contribute at times

00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:13,730
that they're most able to contribute in

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,440
terms of energy focus and distractions

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,590
like it might just be the best time for

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,840
the

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:21,380
it allows people to pursue other

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,720
interests and commitments it makes it

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:27,040
takes people holistically you're not

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,180
just your job it allows people to pursue

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,090
to contribute at times when they're most

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,340
alert and staggered work in an office

00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,660
may allow people who like the focus time

00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,660
do they get early in the morning or

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,640
later in the evening which allows for

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,050
increased productivity and focus so if

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,610
you know that your office gets really

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,310
busy around a certain time you're like

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,410
I'm coming in early and I'm leaving and

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,510
that that's a good thing for people to

00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,950
do and some of the benefits of remote

00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,380
work are that allows people to

00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:57,080
contribute in places where they feel

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,060
comfortable and for people who might

00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,340
experience anxiety it helps reduce

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:05,480
anxiety because you're not surrounded by

00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:07,760
people and so some of the people who can

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,860
benefit from flexible and remote work it

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,800
kind of it opens up things in a really

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,900
big way um that I don't think we really

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,040
think about like it's beneficial for

00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,990
people with mental illness and mental

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,220
disabilities with people who have

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,890
physical illness and physical

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,500
disabilities someone who experienced

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,420
chronic illness parents guardians and

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,210
caregivers if they have that flexibility

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,550
of time or can work remotely that also

00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,140
is really beneficial to them and anyone

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,850
who's had a very uncomfortable or

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,880
traumatic experience specifically in

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:40,310
tech having met flexibility if you if

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,290
sometimes you might somebody might hit a

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,120
trigger being able to like pull back and

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,570
say I'm gonna work from home today that

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,530
really helps so remote work and flexible

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:53,030
work we have to see them though as tools

00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,440
you can't just those two things by

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,780
themselves don't make for a healthy

00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,070
workplace it's being able to see people

00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,130
holistically and know that your

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:04,520
teammates are people are whole people um

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,560
and that everyone is equally valued so I

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,780
think what's been beneficial is that

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,660
we're not judging when people use remote

00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,400
work or when people use flexible work

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,300
everything is the same so I think that's

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,580
been really really valuable um so that's

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,230
it for my talk I just wanted to I guess

00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,260
share just some of the things that have

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,100
really makes a hard year work for me

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,100
does anyone have any questions

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,380
