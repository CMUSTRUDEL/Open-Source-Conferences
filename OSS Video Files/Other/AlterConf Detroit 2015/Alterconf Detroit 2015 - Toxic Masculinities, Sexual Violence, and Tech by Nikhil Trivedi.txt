Description: 
	Toxic Masculinities, Sexual Violence, and Tech

Incidences of violence in our communities over the past several decades have culminated to create hostile and unwelcoming climates for people who don’t experience the privileges of the majority. While we make concerted efforts to recruit new women and people of color, retention rates are much lower than their white men peers. Centering my talk on sexual violence and gender constructs, particularly contemporary masculinities, I’ll provide specific actions we can take in order to make our spaces less toxic for the women and people of color already in our communities.

hey everyone my name is a kilt rivetti

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,760
again and I'm a application developer at

00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,760
a museum in Chicago and I'm also a

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,290
volunteer educator for an organization

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,350
called rape victim advocates who are a

00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,880
social service agency that provides

00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,130
support on medical and legal stuff to

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,410
survivors of sexual assault as well as

00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,840
counseling services to survivors and

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,510
people close to them and education and

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,130
training around sexual violence just to

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,489
add to some of those sort of agreements

00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,480
we set at the beginning anyone in the

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:49,040
room might be affected by sexual

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,780
violence whether it's through our own

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,670
experiences or people that were close to

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,770
so I just like to ask for people to be

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,110
cognizant of that and thoughtful of that

00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,170
before asking any questions and making

00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:02,329
any comments again you can leave the

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,620
room at any time and I'd like you to

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,180
take that with you for the rest of your

00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,890
life you never need to ask anyone's

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,430
permission to ever leave any room ever

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,930
right and I'll be available during the

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,700
breaks and I'm gonna stick around for a

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,560
little while after the conference to

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,860
answer any questions privately or just

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,229
listen for a little while and just for a

00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,770
piece of clarification around language

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm reusing the term woman in my talk to

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:30,799
reference anyone on the gender spectrum

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,600
who's a target of sexism and sexual

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,670
violence and I recognize that that

00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,439
includes people who may not identify as

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,820
the word woman and this is stuff that

00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm still trying to figure out and learn

00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,350
from so if anyone has any sort of

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,780
feedback around language I'd love to

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,119
hear your perspective after the talk so

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:51,290
I want to start by talking about a

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,240
timeline that geek feminism has on their

00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,280
wiki it's a timeline of incidence of

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,860
sexism that has happened in geek

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,720
communities our folks who know you with

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,530
this timeline of people taking a look at

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,329
it I'm seeing quite a bit of nods around

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,899
the room so it's a timeline that goes

00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:11,620
back 50 years to 1962 be like like you'd

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,520
see here and includes things like a

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:18,140
verbal violence

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,520
i sexist jokes shitty things people say

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,110
about other people's bodies and stuff

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,420
like that it includes things like

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,670
stalking and sexual harassment that

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,710
includes things like murder and rape and

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,010
these are things that happen in geek

00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,420
communities including texts spaces

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,750
conferences and meet up some things like

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,550
that so has anyone in this room I'd like

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,170
to ask and I don't want to ask you to

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,900
share anything or not comfortable

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,180
sharing of course but if I may could I

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,100
see a raise of hands of anyone who's

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,980
ever experienced something that could

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,790
that could be on this timeline in a tech

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,340
or gaming community so there's a decent

00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,470
lot of hands up so a follow-up question

00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,720
for folks who did raise their hand or

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:03,740
any of those any of those incidences on

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:10,790
this timeline I don't see any hands up

00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:14,690
raised in the room right so did I right

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:19,490
um so so the link to the timeline is

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,540
here but if you've submitted the thing

00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,850
that you're thinking about to the

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,890
timeline at imagine you may know that

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,959
it's on there right but nonetheless I'm

00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,700
not seeing any hands up in the room so

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,950
this timeline is significant and it's

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,630
important right because it documents

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,000
some really egregious things that have

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,350
happened at our communities but I want

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,660
us to look at this time lines only a

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,640
slice of everything that's happened

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,140
that's happening and that has happened

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,060
at our communities because we know that

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,520
a vast majority of sexual violence goes

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,740
unreported because rightfully so people

00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,830
generally don't feel safe sharing what

00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,240
of what's happened to them so this so I

00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,860
wanted to look at this timeline and

00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,570
think about its timeline but also

00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:02,630
recognize everything that's not on this

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:04,840
timeline and I want to look at this

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,770
timeline in a few different ways right I

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,320
want to look at this time line through

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,450
the lenses of the layers in which

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,030
oppressions operate and if you're not

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,459
familiar with those layers it's personal

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,709
and interpersonal so this timeline is a

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,770
series of real incidents that have

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,870
really happened to real people that

00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,960
really been perpetuated by real people

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,470
so the personal and interpersonal

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,480
Alice's take a step

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,030
back from that and also look at it at

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,220
the community level these are incidences

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,560
that as a community we've allowed to

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,480
happen and I wanted to question the ways

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,070
in which as a community we actually

00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,680
perpetuate this kind of behavior to

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:45,020
happen taking a step further from that

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,690
further back from that I want us to

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,700
connect with the societal level of the

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,580
way in which oppressions operate and

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,290
recognize that the things that are

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,730
happening in our community that allow

00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,520
this stuff that happened that perpetuate

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,650
this stuff to happen isn't an isolation

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,720
right it's connected with the ways in

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,700
which women are treated overall in our

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,680
societies and if we take it a step

00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,450
further back from that I wanted to look

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,160
at it at the institutional level and

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,380
when I talk about institutions I'll talk

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,540
about things like governments like like

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,790
the system of academia large

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,400
institutions in our society that set

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,140
policies or don't set policies that

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,570
allow this stuff to happen and again

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,380
question ways in which our institutions

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,570
may be perpetuating this stuff to happen

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,669
and I want to look at in all these

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,500
different ways because even if someone's

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:34,910
not a direct target of this sort of

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,410
violence of sexual violence in our

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:41,960
communities all these incidences add up

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:44,570
right all these incidences culminate to

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,320
create this climate that sends a message

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,760
to women that are spaces aren't for them

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,120
there is that they're not welcome to our

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:59,120
spaces and that they're not safe in our

00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:00,770
spaces right and I want us to recognize

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,470
that we can't talk about sexual violence

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,750
without also talking about racism

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,840
without also talking about classism in

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,310
homophobia and transphobia and all the

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,320
ways in which power is unevenly

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,160
distributed between people in our world

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,630
because sexism and sexual violence

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,580
exists in parallel with all these other

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,229
oppressions and are connected with all

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,760
these other oppressions and we can't

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,380
talk about one without talking about all

00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,330
the others so I want us to keep our

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,710
minds connected with all those different

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,360
ways that oppressions operate in their

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,050
societies because we're talking about

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,180
all of them at the same time right now

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,039
and there's an interesting contradiction

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,960
here when we look at this timeline right

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,000
because a lot of us have found our

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,390
people and putting our people and air

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,750
quotes

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,220
I don't know why really but I'm a lot of

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,770
us have found our people in these spaces

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,500
right lifelong relationships that we

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,290
couldn't imagine living without right

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,000
for a lot of us these tech and gaming

00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,000
spaces are some of the safest places

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,280
we've ever found for ourselves yet at

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,680
the same time clearly for many folks

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,580
these are some of the most unsafe places

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,700
that they've ever been that's not what I

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,320
want my community look like right if we

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,630
want to make our space is safer for

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,210
women we need to talk about sexual

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,660
violence we need to be able to recognize

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,130
it and name it too many varying degrees

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,260
we need to have a sense about how to

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,780
support survivors of sexual assault and

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,430
we need to interrupt sexual violence and

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,260
that's what I'm here to talk to you

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,300
about today which is kind of a

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,160
no-brainer right like you'd have the

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,520
 jerk not to want to end sexual

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,860
violence in our communities ok so what

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,660
what gets what gets in the way what's

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,210
stopping us from ending sexual violence

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:50,960
right now at like 12 57 or whatever a

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:53,060
156 I'm still on central time so so what

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,870
gets in the way well speaking from my

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,300
own perspective as a sis man our folks

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,890
familiar with the term sis I'm seeing a

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,510
lot of heads in the room but just in

00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:08,780
case sis refers to someone whose whose

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:11,260
gender identification matches the gender

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,810
they were assigned at birth right so I

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:16,520
identify as a man i was assigned to be a

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,110
man at birth write those things match

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,390
for me so speaking from my own

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,900
experience as assist man raised in the

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:26,510
united states we learned as men we learn

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,130
to act out and again using men in that

00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,840
broader sense that i referred to

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,910
referring to women as well at the

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,060
beginning we learned to act out

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,250
patriarchy right we learned to act out

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,100
patriarchy by learning masculinities

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:43,850
there are toxic to ourselves and to

00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,500
everyone around us we learned these

00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:50,030
masculine days that teach us the power

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:53,660
is equal to domination to domination of

00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,290
women and this kind of learning damages

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,860
us it her

00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,829
men you know it it reduces our full

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,800
humanists to only being allowed only be

00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:05,870
given be given the space to be these sex

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,420
and violent machines you know where

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,910
there's no space for emotion there's no

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:15,410
space for vulnerability and it's really

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:17,899
isolating and a lot of us learn really

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,829
similar lessons in pretty different ways

00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:24,380
because there is no one masculinity like

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:26,420
the idea of a universal masculinity is

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,600
 right because masculinity is

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,300
very by things like race by sexual

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,850
orientation by gender right because sis

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,680
men don't own masculinity you don't have

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,540
to be a man to be masculine dude you

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,699
don't have to have a penis too masculine

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,399
right that those two things are separate

00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:45,860
from each other and it make this

00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,750
distinction between masculinities that

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,970
are toxic and those that are healthy

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:58,940
because masculinity in and of themselves

00:09:51,970 --> 00:10:00,319
aren't bad right men aren't bad but the

00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:05,000
ways in which we've learned to value

00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:08,720
ourselves as human through the amount of

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,610
patriarchal power the we that we use

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,790
that we have the wii unwieldy to the

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,670
world like that's up and that's

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,949
bad but men aren't bad and those are

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,899
separate things and in order to end

00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:23,149
sexual violence when we're talking about

00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:25,730
the personal the interpersonal the

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:28,610
communal the societal and institutional

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,829
a significant part of ending sexual

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,740
violence that all those levels is the

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:36,949
personal interpersonal part and as men

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,990
we have to sort of dismantle some of

00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:41,029
this stuff and unravel this stuff that

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,100
we've learned that we may be acting out

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,949
in our relationships with ourselves and

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,540
with the wider world around us and we'll

00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:50,329
talk more about that but before you do

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,670
let's talk about recognizing sexual

00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:55,970
violence and I think it's important that

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,550
we know how to define sexual violence

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,949
because if it's not something that we

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,500
can define it's not something that we

00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:05,720
can name as violence it's not something

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,630
that we can seek justice for and it's

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,440
not something that we can heal from so

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:13,100
recognizing and defining it is a

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,930
significant piece and I think of sexual

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,839
violence as being a spectrum of things

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,060
right all of which are part of this

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,089
system of domination the system of power

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,070
and control over women some of the

00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:27,170
things that you might find on the

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,779
spectrum is like verbal violence and

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,660
that's like i said earlier things like

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:35,149
sexist jokes misogynistic and hateful

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,190
speech shitty things people say about

00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,290
people's bodies I have no doubt that

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,399
everyone in this room can we can spend

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,709
the rest of this time talking about

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,570
examples right the people have either

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:46,970
witnessed or experienced of verbal

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,589
violence also on the spectrum is sexual

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,450
harassment we've already heard people

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:53,300
talking about experience of sex for

00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,769
harassment and talks before me today we

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,760
can think of sexual harassment is any

00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:00,470
sort of unwelcomed sexual advances and

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,720
that could be verbal or that could be

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,149
physical and that could be in person or

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,260
it could be online right speaking to

00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:12,230
that I look like an engineer sort of

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:14,329
response right it was a song it was

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,930
online and it's still considered sexual

00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:19,160
harassment it's typically something that

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,230
happens in a workplace but it also

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,449
happened in a group of friends a team of

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,160
developers and designers because I can

00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:28,850
happen online it can happen on Twitter

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,970
it can happen in IRC channels stuff like

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,339
that also on the spectrum of violence I

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,990
would include stalking and stalking is

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,240
considered conduct that makes one

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,820
reasonably fearful or creates emotional

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,470
distress it include monitoring or

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,300
following and we've already heard

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:48,860
examples today of things that kind of

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:51,649
sound like stalking right and again it

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,320
can be personal in-person or electronic

00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:57,410
and I geek feminism's timeline there

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,880
unfortunately many many many examples of

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,980
stalking that have happened our

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,440
communities over time one person was

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,459
found armed in his car on his way to a

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,149
woman's house who he was harassing

00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:09,949
online right so the disclosure of her

00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,800
address not only gave him information

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:18,529
but he also had a plan and he was found

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:20,540
executing that plan so up a lot

00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:21,560
of examples on geek thunders and

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,510
timeline include death

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,210
let's rape threats along with the

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,500
disclosure of addresses and I'm not good

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm only going to say one thing about

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,700
gamergate and that's right now and

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,860
that's a say that allows the stuff that

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,990
happened in gamergate falls into many of

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,640
these categories right and Stocking was

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,089
a big part of it that's all I'm gonna

00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:44,720
say about gamergate next on the spectrum

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:46,700
is molesting and groping and the legal

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,730
word for molesting and groping is sexual

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,130
abuse and we can think of that as any

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:54,350
sort of sexual conduct touching or

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,990
showing any part of the body that you

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,180
would put under a bathing suit and just

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,890
for clarity for someone who's under 13

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:05,450
it includes any part of the body at all

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:06,770
right and that the piece about showing

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,690
is an interesting part of the definition

00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,670
of sexual abuse because you don't

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,800
actually have to touch someone for it to

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,750
be considered sexual abuse forcing

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,240
someone to witness a sexual act is

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,980
considered sexual abuse and

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,870
unfortunately there are a lot of

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,810
examples of this on the timeline two in

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,330
particular groping so many instances of

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,280
groping in our communities there was one

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,670
example that happened on stage at the

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:34,720
hugo awards do folks know do you want to

00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:39,500
sort of give a quick summary no okay

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,270
well it's there's a video on youtube I'm

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,680
assuming the genders of the people in

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,770
the video so I apologize so I miss

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,839
gender anyone but this guy goes on stage

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,910
to accept an award and a woman is

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,250
presenting the award there at the podium

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,839
having some banter back and forth and at

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,910
some point he just puts his hand on her

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,160
boob and he kind of his linkers there

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,200
for a minute and then drops his hand

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,470
down and then she sort of awkwardly

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,620
wraps up and walks off stage it was very

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,330
public the hugo awards right people

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:14,110
followed the hugo horse to know what

00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:14,110
they are uh okay deep breath

00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:22,679
next up on our spectrum rape the legal

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,939
word for rape is sexual assault and I'll

00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,999
often use those two words

00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:29,339
interchangeably and in the state of

00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:31,410
Michigan I'm from the work I Do's in the

00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,600
state of Illinois I looked up the laws

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,040
in the state of Michigan of how rape is

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,499
defined here and it's to find very

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,499
similarly as it is in Illinois rape is

00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:41,850
defined as any sort of penetration again

00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:44,100
with any part of the body you would put

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,720
under the bathing suit defining a rape

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,999
is any sort of penetration really

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,009
broadens our culture's narrow view of

00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:52,110
what rape is something that happens

00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:54,990
between assist man and it's this woman

00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,600
and involves vaginal penetration right

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,639
when we think of rape more broadly as

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,029
penetration it includes things like

00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,069
forced oral sex that's considered rape

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:07,889
it includes things like force

00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:12,360
penetration with an object that too is

00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:14,759
considered rape and unfortunately there

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:22,160
are instances of rape that are on gphone

00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:24,809
ISM timeline lastly sexual exploitation

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,269
sexual exploitation can be defined as

00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:30,179
the change of sex or sexual acts for

00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:34,769
basic life necessities so things like

00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:35,999
food water shelter protection it can

00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,939
also be in exchange for things like

00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:41,639
drugs or money and sexual exploitation

00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:47,160
is really like the reducing down of all

00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:50,459
of one's options to needing to do a sex

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,759
or sexual act just to survive just for

00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:55,439
basic life survival so those are all the

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,389
things that I would consider is being

00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:59,160
part of the spectrum and again these are

00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,779
all the things that sort of contribute

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,039
to this climate that I talked about

00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:07,860
earlier and I want to make a distinction

00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:12,029
nothing on this spectrum has anything to

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,890
do with sex right sexual violence

00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:16,799
doesn't have anything to do with sex

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:19,919
sexual violence is about power and it's

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,529
about control and the difference between

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,970
sex and violence is consent right

00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:27,809
because sex is something that people

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:30,149
mutually agree to enthusiastically

00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:32,429
right people mutually agree to before

00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:35,070
something happens and every step of the

00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:37,080
way during something happening at any

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,059
point you know someone could say hey you

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,259
know I'm up for this let's do it halfway

00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,899
through the like you know what I'm not

00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,720
feeling this anymore it should stop

00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:48,679
right because I any point the consent

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,879
isn't given and something happens anyway

00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,370
that's when something crosses the line

00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:55,379
between sex and violence nothing up here

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:59,879
has anything to do with sex I want to be

00:17:55,379 --> 00:18:05,429
very clear about that so let's talk

00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:09,749
let's just take another deep breath how

00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:11,970
folks doing I'm seeing a few nods okay

00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:16,019
cool so let's talk briefly about

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:18,389
supporting survivors if you only take

00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:20,759
one thing away from my talk today here I

00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:23,159
want it to be this I want you to hold

00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,779
these three things in your brain just

00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,179
like tuck them away somewhere for the

00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,529
rest of your life anytime someone

00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,179
discloses something that happened to

00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:32,129
that it could be hard for you as a

00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,990
person who cares about this person who's

00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:35,940
telling you these things even if you

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,980
don't know what to say if you don't know

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,899
how to act just hold these three things

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,529
in your brain for the rest of your life

00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:47,700
and save them I believe you it's not

00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:51,059
your fault you have options I believe

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,720
you it's not your fault you have options

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:57,059
I believe you because the rate of false

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,619
reporting of rape is really low you

00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,659
wouldn't believe it listening to any

00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:02,879
sort of news in our world but it's about

00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:04,919
two to eight percent which is exactly on

00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:07,350
par with the false reporting rate of

00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,960
other crimes right and the cards are

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,090
stacked against people so much to

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,769
disclose what's happened to them just

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,869
read any comments of any article about

00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:18,090
Woody Allen or Bill Cosby or Patrick

00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:19,860
Kane right these are the kind of things

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,320
that people are up against when they

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,539
share what's happened to them in my view

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,179
people have no reason to lie about this

00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:29,669
sort of violence I believe you and tell

00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,769
them that they that you believe them to

00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,619
it's not your fault because nothing that

00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:36,990
anybody does asks for this violence to

00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,720
be brought to them none of the

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,360
responsibility of what happened is on

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,059
the survivors shoulders is

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,660
responsibility it's a sole decision of

00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:49,970
the person perpetrating the violence

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,429
it's not your fault and do you have

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,290
options you don't have to know what all

00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:56,510
the options are you just have to assure

00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,580
them that there are many many ways that

00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,290
someone can process this there are many

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,970
ways that someone can seek justice from

00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,740
this justice doesn't have to look like

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,330
the criminal legal system right there

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,780
are many ways to seek justice from this

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,700
there are many ways to heal from this so

00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,980
take a look around the room and make eye

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,040
contact with someone and say these three

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,419
things with me are people comfortable

00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,780
doing that I'm seeing a lot of blank

00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:22,790
stares well just look at me just look at

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:27,890
me and say these three things out loud

00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:35,390
with me I believe you it's not your

00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:37,600
fault and you have options so let's talk

00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,770
about interrupting sexual violence I

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:46,040
think I might be a little over my time

00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:49,250
is um okay just give me a wave if I

00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,890
should stop so when we talk about

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,870
interrupting sexual violence I want to

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,419
go back to those levels in which

00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:59,020
operation oppressions operate what were

00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:59,020
those levels again

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,970
yes personal interpersonal community

00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:13,640
society and institutions and I want to

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,919
focus today on the first two personal

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,809
and interpersonal I'm not going to give

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,520
you strategies on how to jump in and be

00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,350
a savior when you see something that's

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,090
happening generally I'd like you to if

00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,429
you have that sort of image in your head

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,110
I'd like you to throw it away because if

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:28,850
you see something happening every

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,200
situation is different it's really

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,809
important to follow the lead of the

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,549
survivor you know we know that sexual

00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,440
violence is about power and is about

00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:38,480
control it's about taking the power away

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,250
from someone one of the most important

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,559
things we can do to support someone is

00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,570
to restore that power back to them by

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,520
following their lead even if that means

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,700
not intervening when you absolutely

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,590
believe you should write follow the

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,559
follow the survivors lead but

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,350
nonetheless with the personal and

00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,799
interpersonal piece of dismantling this

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:03,340
stuff as for the men in the room I want

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,900
us to think about the ways in which we

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,370
benefit I wanted to hold ourselves

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,600
accountable for the ways in which we

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:13,070
benefit from sexism and male domination

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,809
even if we don't know that I need the

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,940
stuff is happening I don't think it

00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:19,370
doesn't seem like anyone this is our new

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,440
ideas 10 you in this room but even if so

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,610
even if this is the first time you've

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,890
ever heard of any of this stuff

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,299
happening our communities I hope I've

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,549
made it abundantly clear that these

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:31,340
things are happening and to an alarming

00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:33,409
degree by participating in the

00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,030
communities that we participate in like

00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:38,919
getting whatever it is we get out of our

00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:42,919
communities friendships work

00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:44,539
relationships we benefit from this

00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,909
current climate that I've been

00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,039
describing by participating in the

00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:51,919
communities we participating in we're

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,780
benefiting from this current climate the

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,190
more honest we can be with ourselves and

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,320
more vulnerable we can be with each

00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,720
other about thoughts and moments that

00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,360
were unsure about the stronger our

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,789
relationships will become the more open

00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,970
our communities will become and the safe

00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:09,770
Raila become because of it this work

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,690
very much starts with ourselves in

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:14,299
addition to needing to happen at a

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,640
larger community and societal level but

00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:17,600
I'd like to sort of leave you with this

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,530
action

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,049
right over the next week I want you to

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,460
find one person in your community that

00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:27,440
you feel comfortable having a

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,330
conversation like this with if they're

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,539
not in this room today talks in about

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,220
the spectrum of violence and then

00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:36,230
exchanged two minutes like this where

00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,789
you're given two minutes to talk and

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,970
then they're given two minutes to talk I

00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:43,549
want you to find one person over the sex

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:46,809
one week and have one conversation with

00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:49,429
them is that something you guys can do

00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:51,860

00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,630
love to hear sort of what what the

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,640
experience was like for you break

confidentiality I'm not going to ask you

00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,240
to tell me what you guys talked about

00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,909
but I'd love to hear what the process

00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,940
