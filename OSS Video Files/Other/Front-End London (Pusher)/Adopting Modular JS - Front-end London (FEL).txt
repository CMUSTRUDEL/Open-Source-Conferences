Title: Adopting Modular JS - Front-end London (FEL)
Publication date: 2016-07-14
Playlist: Front-End London
Description: 
	Writing applications that are both maintainable and scalable is a challenge, but one we can more easily overcome with modularisation. The emergence of new module types and powerful tools has furnished JavaScript developers with the freedom and control they need to deliver easy-to-manage and larger scale web products. In this talk, Richard Bultitude explains what modular development is, why you should use it and how you can implement it as a solo dev or within your organisation.
