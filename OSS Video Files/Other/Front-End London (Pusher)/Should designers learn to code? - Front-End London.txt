Title: Should designers learn to code? - Front-End London
Publication date: 2016-09-19
Playlist: Front-End London
Description: 
	The debate for whether designers should learn to code is not brand new anymore, however, it is a question that still keeps arising and baffling many. In today's so ever changing digital climate it is quite difficult to pin point what exactly one should do. So how can we go about finding a solution?

	00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,490
sure designers learn to code I've

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:16,309
started as a digital designer and sort

00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,810
of slowly went into code because i just

00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:22,609
find it quite intriguing and interesting

00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,380
so sorry i'll be reading from my notes

00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:29,660
little bit as well so i hope you don't

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:32,420
mind but I think this designer code

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,390
think has been happening for a while now

00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:39,530
and there's been a rise in the industry

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,390
in the so-called unicorn so and a lot of

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,310
people seem to say oh no that's a bad

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,560
thing you should not do that you should

00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,880
just focus and others are like no you

00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,090
should embrace that because it's a good

00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,620
thing so yeah I just sort of want to

00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,170
talk about my experience and what I

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:58,340
think and what I've gone through and how

00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,980
that's kind of how I see it so I just

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:05,059
wondered is anyone here designer by any

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:08,270
chance oh cool and do any of you code as

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:13,429
well you did awesome say cold so it's

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:16,130
not just me that's good um okay so let's

00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:20,420
get on with that so I thought let's look

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:23,030
at what I designer does so as you can

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,710
see it's all quite visual so anything to

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:30,140
do with colors wireframing layouts

00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:32,630
sketching drawing that sort of thing and

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,569
I developers role is quite different

00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,819
it's sort of all to jiye with logical

00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:42,789
thinking some solving a problem writing

00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:45,200
things down so why would you want to

00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:47,840
introduce something that's so different

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,219
into your work because you've already

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,780
got so much to do as a designer

00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:56,259
evidently it's a different kind of skill

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,259
all together

00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:04,430
and has anyone seen I'm sure all of you

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:08,240
have seen napoleon dynamite show the

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:11,750
hands yeah yeah so because and the

00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,960
reason is because he's got the answer to

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,680
exercise as I said some people say what

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,750
you actually need is for people to focus

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,760
designers should know really well what

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,530
they're doing and just focus on design

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,820
and do nothing else and developers

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,070
should just be really good at

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,850
development and really lot even looking

00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:34,010
to anything else and I think that works

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,130
really well in larger companies where

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,780
you have people like 10 UX designers do

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,510
you like slightly different thing within

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:46,370
the UX and they work on large projects

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:48,440
and bringing together such skill really

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,600
like mix for something amazing for

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,600
amazing work but

00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:00,469
I think in some cases you have varied

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,560
work environments and you can't always

00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:05,450
have that so in a perfect world you

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,430
would yes you would have people who

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,549
would just do one thing and work on

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,280
amazing incredible / for the projects

00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:17,540
but actually sometimes it's hard to find

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,980
that perfect match as well and it is

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,469
probably one of the reasons why people

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,040
sort of bent into different disciplines

00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:27,349
as this tweet like I don't know how many

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,329
of you know of this and Twitter account

00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:32,329
but it's kind of like a parody account

00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:34,849
and basically so I think this happens

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,799
quite a lot actually in work wear

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:40,010
designer wants something and developed

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,650
it's just like no can just know and

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,150
actually it's all to do with people not

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,000
quite understanding each other not

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:50,030
understanding so much their whole field

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,469
not having a full picture so you know

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:59,209
not communicating enough which is

00:03:54,469 --> 00:04:02,419
actually the big problem we kind of get

00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:04,609
stuck in this catch-22 I want to do

00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:07,879
there's no your coin do this and there's

00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:09,739
just so many arguments between people so

00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,590
I think that's one of the reasons why

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:15,169
some people choose to learn both just

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,030
quite a good idea I think so perhaps we

00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,739
need more designers you know about code

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,039
and specific signed digital applications

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:24,020
I'm same with developers we need people

00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:26,280
who understand what designers have to go

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,020
through and

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,430
designers need to understand what they

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:37,080
need to implement in order to achieve

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:41,310
what they need yowzers again it's all

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,080
about communication but actually when

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,540
you learn something new or broaden your

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,580
horizon you suddenly learn something

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,160
else you suddenly see oh actually does

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,050
more to the world and I think that's

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,630
quite important to keep searching for

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,880
new things just in which your work to

00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:01,110
kind of always just just to keep it

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,080
interesting and I think all of that just

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,760
ends up and bettering your wife anyway

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,660
so that's another reason why you would

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,190
want to learn something new and also

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,760
coding is becoming so increasingly

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:18,630
accessible and you know there's so much

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,940
open source starved s Twitter there's

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,460
code been where you can see code and

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,110
liner and just so many online resources

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,620
where you can learn so it's actually

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:31,560
quite easy and quite successful and some

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,390
people do seem to look at code I know

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,160
some people look at my screen my friends

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,870
and they're like god what is this like

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,530
actually how can you even understand

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,419
this but I think it's all about how you

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,340
look at something if you want to learn

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:48,090
something new if you want to learn

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,310
something it's all about how you

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,140
perceived that subject so you could look

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,110
at code as just learning another

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,600
language you know just to write like you

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,940
and you must apiece maybe or something

00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,880
so yeah so at the end of the day I think

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,700
coding is a tool to achieve something to

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,130
build something so I think it's

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,540
important to went before you start just

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,270
sort of

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:17,890
make yourself accessible to it by you

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:19,720
know with your thoughts towards it so

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,930
actually perhaps the question isn't

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,360
should designers code I don't actually

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,310
think in order to be a good digital

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,140
designer in order to understand the

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,900
industry and stand developers don't

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,780
actually need to learn how to create but

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,450
it's good to kind of understand how good

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:40,770
works some and use it to empower your

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:44,200
work really kind of see the full picture

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,300
so for example if you work with sketch

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,270
as a designer there are so many plugins

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,550
like Zeppelin that help you deal with

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,670
developers so yeah it's just kind of

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,430
setting yourself up in the right way to

00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:02,169
be able to work within your team i also

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:04,510
want to talk about this change and a

00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,970
need for change within our work

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,970
environments and so does actually a

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:14,050
change in our industry which is always

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:16,540
happening of course but ever so more

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:22,900
currently there's been quite a shift and

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:25,540
the way things are working which kind of

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,370
indicate that maybe actually where we're

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,680
going somewhere different in the future

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,600
so I don't know if many of you read this

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,990
article the death of the web design

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:40,390
agency that's been published in the net

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:43,690
magazine where they actually talk about

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:48,970
the business model of the agencies

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:51,400
currently shifting and a lot of a lot of

00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,160
companies that used to hire freelancers

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,990
web design agencies they're not doing

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,960
that so much anymore and that's really

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:02,680
kind of dying out so people are feeling

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,419
like workers actually drying out

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,880
a lot of companies are taking our

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:09,240
in-house designers and developers and

00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,270
this is how things are moving forward

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,889
and also you have stuff like Squarespace

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,080
for example white breast it's been

00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:20,800
around for a while but it's something

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,800
that makes making and maintaining web

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,330
page is quite easy for people and Karen

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,860
McGrane who is a UX designer she

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,380
believes designers need to broaden their

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,529
skill sets or even developers and in

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,719
this case going beyond design or

00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:41,349
development and perhaps into other areas

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,539
of business because we are actually like

00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:47,110
especially as freelancers were quiet at

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:51,370
the mercy of the business so for example

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:54,550
maybe you're a freelance designer and

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:59,589
actually you need to learn another skill

00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:01,270
set maybe maybe going to consulting or

00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:04,270
something like this in order to kind of

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:06,940
carry on doing your job as you are

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,760
because of the shift within the industry

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,170
hence again kind of supporting my

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,450
argument for things are always changing

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:18,910
and it's good to embrace that and also

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,250
sarah Parmenter which i'm sure most of

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,830
you heard she's quite a well-known web

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:28,990
designer she wrote this very interesting

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:31,120
blog post big elephant in the room where

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,070
where again she talks about how a lot of

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,260
people have been messaging her emailing

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,770
her and asking like what's happening the

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:42,370
work is very drying out and what can we

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:46,520
do about it and this kind of just brings

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:48,950
brings home that things are changing

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:53,660
and we are entering a whole new year of

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:56,030
web design as Sarah Parmenter fit set so

00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:59,840
all of this might sound quite scary like

00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,820
what's happening but actually I think it

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,970
doesn't have to be it could be quite

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:08,780
exciting because maybe we're entering

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:10,250
into something new and the more new

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,430
things that we learn the more we can

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,560
improve ourselves now work and the

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,830
industry and all our texts so actually

00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,370
this is a give a good thing this is one

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:24,710
of my favorite books the best interface

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,750
is no interface by golden Krishna it

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,300
sounds quite controversial especially

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,090
for me somewhere UI designer so I'm

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,770
thinking what is the future I'm not

00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:39,800
going to have UI design what am I going

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:42,500
to do but actually he welcomes a new

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,190
vision of the future of interface app

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:49,550
and web design and really dissect the

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:52,600
fundamentals of UX design so in this

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:56,810
book he actually gives an example of

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,700
having an app for car keys and so you

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:02,510
actually have to take a number of steps

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,520
in order to access your car if you have

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,770
it on a nap whereas if you just had your

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:11,540
car users just one click of a button and

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:14,120
it's done so I think we often think oh

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,760
how can I put this in a nap but we don't

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,340
think this is that the best way to do

00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,300
things so I found it quite interesting

00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,250
that he questions that and the actor

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,130
says can we work to make a better

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,620
interface or something working with

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,550
human reaction and in instincts not so

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,250
much you know just like apps because

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,900
maybe we've been stuck in this kind of

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,370
the same way of doing the things which

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,740
ye long been we just kind of need to

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,500
shake you up and see what else can we do

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,160
where else can we go

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:51,950
what else can we improve so to me code

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:56,750
is just really another tool for

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:59,839
designing things I you know I use I use

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:03,290
it to improve my wire can order to

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,660
understand what I'm doing it sort of

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,970
helps me with InDesign as well because I

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,860
know well i can actually code this up

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,839
and this would work or this wouldn't

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,980
work this would be really bad you act so

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,290
i'm not going to design in that way

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:25,940
because you know number of clicks or

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:27,649
notch with interfere and yes so just to

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,700
conclude from all the odds articles and

00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:33,649
everything i'm sure we like i'm sure all

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,300
of our roles within like next ten years

00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:37,130
or so will change it will be different

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,250
than our industry will be different as

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:42,170
well and it's kind of up to us to

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,209
embrace them to kind of look towards new

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,060
things and see well i'm also interested

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:49,910
in this how can I use that within my

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,510
work to better my work to kind of make

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,209
myself a as well just so you know you

00:12:53,510 --> 00:13:01,100
always find new exciting things that you

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:03,350
can do as well and you know whatever

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,910
Road you take it to adjourn Ian and it's

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:09,019
okay to do what you really want to do

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:13,200
the best thing you can do is open

00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:15,180
yourself up to try new things

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,910
and learning something new to enrich

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,070
your work and your abilities and the

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,650
thing that's just you know within every

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,040
aspect of your life kind of not stains

00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:29,310
segments but kind of trying to improve

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,370
yourself it's a good thing and while

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:36,210
actually I wanted to share from gold

00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:40,550
into code I had little projects that

00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,550
came about which is

00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:50,589
which is this so it's can you see that

00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:54,019
okay it's basically I've started a blog

00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:56,209
so designer this code and I've just

00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:58,399
thought all of my frustration with

00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:01,430
learning code and having to write code

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:06,680
into this and kind of blog posts trying

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:13,339
to make it funny so what what's a good

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:18,259
one I can show you yes so when someone's

00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:20,480
like oh you do that voice encoding so

00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,970
and another reason why I love bryton

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,069
code is when you fix a bug it's just the

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:30,139
best feeling in the world it's almost it

00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:32,629
just feels like this again functional

00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:35,480
programming just trying to make jokes I

00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:39,920
was trying to make my work more fun I

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,610
hate reading documentation you know you

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,610
can tell i'm a designer

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:58,040
looking at your old code we're getting

00:14:48,680 --> 00:15:04,130
to pull before committing absolutely

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:07,430
love stack overflow it's my god the

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:10,900
better ones so kind of outing pixels jam

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,900
that's nice as well

00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:21,400
trying to find good woman

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,500
oh this thing counting everything from

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:28,450
zero at first it was like what is this

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:30,430
it's just weird so I'd stole something

00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:33,430
another thing breaks you know like what

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:37,350
is happening when you write your first

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,350
year sanction this was literally me

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:46,600
again someone trying to explain HP to me

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:48,910
I was just like no don't understand so

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:54,100
when you start advanced SAS it's pretty

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:55,720
cool this is how it feels yeah so it's

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,690
just these little sort of little things

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,850
that I've learned and they've enriched

00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:04,590
my life so much it just made it more fun

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:07,650
um it was just it's a good thing to do

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:10,980
so that's the little project that came

00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,980
from that

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:23,630
so should designers code and I hope I

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,450
haven't said yes or no but sort of gay

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:29,450
reasons for and against and you can make

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:33,080
your own minds up because I think you

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,550
should do what you want actually in life

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,680
and you should be listening to other

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,770
people because they're not living your

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:45,410
life but I also think it's quite

00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:48,110
important to have a reason why you're

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:50,210
doing that have a vision and the like in

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,860
the future like what you're working

00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,340
towards not just kind of go and learn

00:16:51,860 --> 00:17:00,410
all the random code so I work primarily

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:02,330
with SAS and CSS architecture I were

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,850
assigned a bit with JavaScript as well

00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:08,089
but this is why I kind of draw the line

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:11,810
and you know I enjoy that and I love

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:14,200
that so yes and yeah that's all thank

00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,200
