hi everyone yeah so I'm Chara I'm a

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,919
software engineer futurelearn so if you

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,710
don't know about futurelearn we're a

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,900
social learning company we're enabling

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,240
online learning through conversation and

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,090
before future and I was a graduate

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,730
software engineer at Marks and Spencer

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,550
so the whole as the junior part of my

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,439
career kind of happened while I was on

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,070
that gradua scheme but obviously when I

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,689
say junior it doesn't really just means

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,719
you know depending on where you work it

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,399
has different titles and if you're like

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,440
you don't even have a specific time told

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,100
you just and Angele like everybody else

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,309
so I wanted to do this talk because I

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,500
got really confused by the whole process

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,289
of how I could show that I was making

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,329
progress in my career like was I ready

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,680
to make a formal leap from junior to

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,500
mid-level engineer what does that even

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,140
mean was like how was I supposed to do

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,969
it so I thought I'd kind of share what

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,489
I've learned along the way for other

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,659
people and talk about what we can do as

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,430
juniors and supporters as well to help

00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:12,689
junior developers get on to the next

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,420
stage in their career so we can tackle

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:19,380
this obviously from both sides but let's

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:23,610
start with junior developers I think one

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,860
of the most important things that we can

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,479
be doing as junior developers is working

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,060
on ways that we can start to stretch

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,710
ourselves so I always actually do an

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,640
internal growing when I hear someone

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,159
tell me all you've got to stretch

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,420
yourself you to push yourself like nope

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,150
that just means I gotta do something I

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,430
don't want to do I'm gonna find it

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,659
uncomfortable but if it is a necessary

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,549
evil for me that was public speaking or

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,990
Weatherly any type of general

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,740
communication you should see me in

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:56,040
stand-ups or sprint reviews like it was

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,869
really awkward but the whole process of

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,570
putting myself out there a little bit by

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,630
bit made that prospect a little bit less

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,759
terrifying each time but yeah you can do

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,829
lots of things to stretch yourself and

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,020
don't just restrict it to technical or

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,160
programming aspects because at the end

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,710
of a you can be the most technical

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,720
person in the world but without your

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,950
communication those softer skills then

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,550
you're not gonna be able to communicate

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,950
with your team for example one per one

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,380
graduate I used to work with one as it

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,910
Marks and Spencer they said they knew

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,070
that are moving out of that junior

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,020
developer mindset when they could start

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,420
teaching people in their team things and

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,540
teaching in itself is a really crucial

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,000
skill that we kind of expect from senior

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,230
engineers or tech leads but we don't

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,350
have to wait until we've gotten more

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:48,150
experience to start practicing this so

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:50,520
am i involved in koba and that itself is

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,200
a great way to improve your own

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,210
knowledge and confidence while

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,820
supporting a new person in their new

00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,990
career goals and I also found that when

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,840
I was helping somebody that was

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,120
completely new you I knew so much more

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,070
than I thought I did I was like coming

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,250
out with answers that I didn't even know

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:11,280
I had but that simple act of like

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,810
helping a completely new person put an

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,230
image tag on their page and then

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:19,410
thinking it's complete magic it's such a

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,570
good feeling so I definitely definitely

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,220
recommend helping out an organization

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,770
like Coke bar and coaching at those kind

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,210
of places because it's great for them

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,120
and it's also great to improve your

00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,380
skills and a great way to check that

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,740
you're stretching yourself the right

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,230
amount is by thinking about it in terms

00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,300
of these zones so starting in the middle

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,640
this is your comfort zone and everything

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,480
in here is like a day-to-day activities

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,480
things that you do but you don't learn

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,340
very much from these this area so it's

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,460
it's an essential place in terms of

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,830
feeling calm and reflecting but if you

00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,660
want to be developing your skills what

00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,120
you want to be doing is moving out into

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,010
the stretch zone so literally stepping

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,830
out of your comfort zone so everything

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,320
in here includes activities that

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,240
challenge you personally but they don't

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,000
overwhelm you so this could be something

00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,250
you've never ever done before or it

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,630
could be a completely old activity that

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,900
you do all the time but you're doing in

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,220
a completely new way and I do is that

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,989
obviously it doesn't feel comfortable

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,200
but that act of going and doing

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:26,760
something new helps you develop and

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,890
you're learning something different

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,680
but you can't go too far with this so

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:35,430
ideally you want to avoid this own this

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,270
is the panic zone so yeah if you feel

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:41,220
like this is too far basically and how

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,970
to tell so if you imagine yourself doing

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,620
that activity if you think about it like

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,600
you go that few butterflies in your

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,980
stomach but you can still do it then

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,740
you're probably comfortably in the

00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,720
stretch zone but if you imagine yourself

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,270
doing that activity and you'd like want

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,850
to throw up fall on the floor then yeah

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,950
maybe not today is in your panic zone

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,800
and it is worth saying that just because

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,030
something's in your stretch zone today

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,560
doesn't mean it can't be in your comfort

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,000
zone tomorrow and just because

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,760
something's in your panic zone today

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,920
doesn't mean that it won't move into

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,390
your stretch zone next month or next

00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,580
week because as the more you develop

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:21,440
your skills the more you become more

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,150
comfortable with some of these things I

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,890
think one of the other ways kind of

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,990
related to this that Gina developers can

00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,360
start to be moving on to the next stage

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,680
in their career is thinking about ways

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,650
that they can make a change in their

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,300
wider business and this is when you come

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,860
across something that as a junior you

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,190
find like a little bit annoying and you

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,720
think something can be done about this

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,390
so it's probably unlikely that you're in

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,820
a company that this doesn't happen and

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:50,280
it can be anything from a small

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,880
technical issue or a massive

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,100
non-technical issue and for me I wanted

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,440
to work on getting rotations in the

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,170
Graduate scheme that I was on so we I

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,670
did I was a front-end developer for

00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,230
twelve months of the Graduate scheme I

00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,660
thought it'd be really cool if we can

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,300
try different areas of the business so I

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,490
worked with my other grads and the

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,620
engineering managers to get this process

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,650
happening and that happened for the

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,010
following years grants well I think

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,420
absolutely if you get a chance to make a

00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,860
change or see a chance to improve

00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,540
something you should fix it

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,740
in fact like you should fix all the

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:30,570
things but seriously it's hard to do

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,240
depending on how much you've learned

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,580
because for the first three to six

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,690
months on my grad scheme I was trying so

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,220
hard to figure out like what the heck

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,600
was going on I was absorbing all this

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,600
new information in a big

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,100
in a brand-new really big business that

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,630
I didn't really have that much time to

00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,800
think about what was annoying or what

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,620
could be an issue that could be fixed

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,180
but as you get into role as you get used

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,770
to where you are you start to pick

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,130
things up that you can make a change

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,590
with and I would definitely recommend

00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,120
going out and making your whole the

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,460
workplace a better place but it's not

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,530
just good to see you it's also good for

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,020
the people that you work with and it's

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,600
also great like extracurricular activity

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,990
when you're going and talking about that

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,280
next stage in your career and it's also

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,710
worth saying that you don't have to do

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,400
this alone like raise it with team

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:23,330
managers mentors your input your

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,100
colleagues and make that change together

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,050
so one of the final things I wish I had

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,660
done more as a junior developer is

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:34,590
working on gathering evidence as I had

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,390
them so this is really easy if the

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,360
company you work at has a career ladder

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,800
in place because you can match the

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,860
skills that they set to different levels

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,480
of engineering with examples of where

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,530
you pick them up all you've learned them

00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:52,140
but if you don't just think of some

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,690
skills that kind of go well across lots

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,160
of different businesses so what your

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,290
programming skills like have you gotten

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,070
examples of where you even learn a new

00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:04,470
programming language or implemented

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,240
something really cool or what are your

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,100
communication skills like have you got

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,930
examples of how well you're

00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,490
communicating with in your team or with

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,590
the wider technical team are you

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,340
proactive are you going out and doing

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,080
different things that are a little bit

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,700
outside of your role but also great for

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,430
the team that you're working in and have

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,620
you the examples of these and the same

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,670
for how well you are at giving and

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,260
receiving feedback or showing good team

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:35,490
working on the flipside of that how well

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,289
are you at working independently so once

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,539
you start to get like examples for these

00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,700
areas just keeping a track of them in

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,160
something like a Trello board or Google

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,840
Doc is what I had or like but it

00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,450
journaling it's good for you to look

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,070
back on and as you start to see them add

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,850
up it's a really good confidence piece

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,020
and at the same time

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,230
again it's also good when you go into

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,610
interviews and meetings you have this

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:02,150
document to refer to of all the amazing

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,250
things that you've been doing doing but

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,350
that's a lot of advice for juniors

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,050
what about supporters how can we be

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:12,200
encouraging and uplifting the juniors

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,720
that we're working with well I think one

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,640
of the important things that we can be

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,320
doing is just investing some time having

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,180
an a' junior can affect the productivity

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,480
in your team but it's make but we're

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,710
making a worthwhile investment the point

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,570
is we want them to upskill to

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,790
appointment where they can be really

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,620
independent and working as part of their

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:37,340
team on their own so work spend time

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,920
developing their strengths and

00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,260
weaknesses getting to know the pairing

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,790
sessions for example but pairing

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,950
sessions is something that can be done

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,780
really badly I've had not the best

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:52,370
experiences of pairing in the past I

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:54,530
once fell asleep in a pairing session it

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,600
was only for a second

00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,790
I woke back up and looked around

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,590
realized I was saw that they were still

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,480
looking at the screen typing stuff away

00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,930
explaining things to me that I wasn't

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,750
really understanding obviously that is

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:11,270
not a good interactive pairing session

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,790
and obviously I wasn't like taking

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,890
anything in so if you're somebody that's

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,200
supporting a junior developer like give

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:21,290
them the keyboard let them drive and let

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,860
them go learn pace that's suitable for

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,540
them because once you put the keyboard

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,700
in front of them they're immediately

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,800
more engaged they have to figure stuff

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,750
out for them and like if you let them

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,090
figure that stuff out it's really useful

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,070
in terms of making sure that you're

00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:40,370
developing at a pace that's suitable for

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,890
you but also asked questions that check

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,320
in on their understanding so instead of

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,090
asking like close questions did that

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,860
make sense and they say yeah because

00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:54,050
well instead ask them like if I move

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,280
that line of code down to the bottom of

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,450
the function what do you think is going

00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,670
to happen if I run the tests against

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,170
this function what do you think is going

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,980
to happen like you'll get a better

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,529
understanding of where there are

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,850
if they're following along and if you

00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:11,160
find that there are gaps that you can go

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:15,600
back and help explain things a little

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,970
bit clearer and learning in this kind of

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,610
way will go both ways so not only will

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,440
the junior you're helping learn but

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,050
they're supporter that's supporting

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,639
their junior will also start to learn

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,959
more leadership skills and teaching

00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,339
skills so it's a great for both of you

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,889
you find that like working with junior

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,180
developers their lack of a minute

00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:38,699
familiarity in the system and the code

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,459
base that they have completely fresh

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:43,139
ideas that some of the things that more

00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:47,850
experienced people would not even if the

00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:50,880
world I think it's worth creating

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,680
opportunities for junior developers so

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,510
once you start to get to know them you

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,110
thought got to know their strengths

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,820
their weaknesses you can start to create

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,420
opportunities for them to develop the

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:06,000
places where they find challenging so

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,550
one of the things I did was a thing

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,170
called living objectives so you'll find

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,790
that in businesses you usually have like

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,380
an annual performance review and you set

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,730
some objectives and you come back to in

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,980
a year and see how you've been getting

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,230
along but as a junior developer you're

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,350
learning so much so quickly that it

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,389
doesn't really work so well

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,829
so this is what my living objectives

00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:28,560
looked like when I first started out as

00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:30,060
a grand juror around the outside of the

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,610
things I thought were important to my

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,459
role and then the orange strength is my

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,230
goal in each of those areas so I like I

00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:40,139
want it to be amazing at javascript and

00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,550
CSS but as a front-end developer I

00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,670
thought I didn't need to think so much

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,839
about back into engineering at the time

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,399
and then I tape in the middle with just

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,440
my confidence level in each of these

00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,630
areas so I always really wanted to

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,990
improve my communication skills where I

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,930
do tests I thought I was okay JavaScript

00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,370
but obviously sauce or into improvement

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,959
and when you start working with your

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,760
junior and you see something like this

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,220
you know what areas will be good to

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,449
focus on so you can prioritize things

00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,370
that are really important to their role

00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:10,290
like JavaScript an example but then you

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:14,670
can also prioritize areas that you think

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:16,130
they're not suppose confident in so my

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:20,340
engineering one it just

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:21,930
at some time in an engineering capture

00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,380
for me to talk about how I found

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:28,410
learning es6 so as so i had time to

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:31,980
learn es6 and also practice speaking and

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:34,380
presenting so as you get to know the

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,060
genie you work with it's really great to

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,330
create opportunities for them to develop

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:42,470
the skills that they find challenging

00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:45,300
and another really important area for

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,920
supporters to be doing for juniors is

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,310
just giving them some regular feedback

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,610
and this is something i wanted the most

00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:56,940
because it's just really helpful for me

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,820
to see where i'm at and how i can be

00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,830
improving so there's gonna be anything

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,210
from a quick one liner like that pull

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,080
request rewrite was really really good

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:09,900
or that approach you took it was really

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,340
well written or it could be full-blown

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,160
written report on all the things that

00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:17,640
you're doing amazingly well on or things

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,260
that you can be improving another grad

00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,700
that I worked with they said that they

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,520
just inviolate there were at the

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,310
mid-level point they wanted confirmation

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,310
from the people around them and I think

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:32,670
that just shows how important it is from

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,770
lots of points of views it's really hard

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,810
to see as that uni developer how well

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,690
you're doing when everyone around you

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:44,580
kind of seems to be like they know

00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:47,910
everything okay so I covered quite a few

00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:50,070
points there if I do a quick recap so I

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:53,180
think juniors should be looking at ways

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:56,370
that they can be stretching themselves

00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:59,460
and improving and developing your own

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,710
personal skills I think also genius you

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,320
can be looking at ways that you can make

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:06,660
a change in your wider business whether

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,730
that is through something small

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,880
something massive something technical

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,830
something completely non-technical and

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,910
also start to just gather evidence of

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,800
all the amazing things you're doing

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:20,070
whether that's on Trello or bullet

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,950
journaling and then to the people that

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,570
are supporting junior developers I think

00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,600
it's important that you just do vest in

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:30,000
time to help them develop

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,710
create opportunities for them to start

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,090
improving the areas that they find

00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,500
challenging and also provide some

00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,700
regular feedback so they know if they're

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,590
doing well if they're on the right track

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,340
or if they can be doing something to

00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:46,470
improve so the final quote from a

00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,790
graduate I used to work with he just

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,750
said you know I don't think you wake up

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,410
one day and realize you're not a junior

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:55,290
developer anymore and she was so right

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,790
um myself I never really came to the

00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,710
conclusion that I wasn't a junior

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,330
anymore that never really happened I

00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,720
mean if we were doing things right we

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,430
should always be a junior at something

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,920
but for me I just managed to have enough

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:11,220
examples against a mid-level runoff that

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:15,210
I got and that kind of made the

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,950
transition real so to junior developers

00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,380
I definitely say that you should go out

00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,980
and get that promotion for yourself you

00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:25,050
go out and develop your personal goals a

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,580
timeframe that suits you but actually

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,000
you don't worry about it because you're

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:37,340
doing amazingly well thank you so much

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,340
