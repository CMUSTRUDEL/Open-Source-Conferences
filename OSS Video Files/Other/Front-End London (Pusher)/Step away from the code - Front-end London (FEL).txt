Title: Step away from the code - Front-end London (FEL)
Publication date: 2016-07-14
Playlist: Front-End London
Description: 
	In this talk, Clare Evans talks about the highs and lows of going from building a product alone in a small dark room, to letting other developers get their filthy mitts all over your pristine code, while you figure out what the hell it should do next

This talk was part of the Front-end London (FEL) May 2016 event.

I'm fair i work at pug pig and I'm going

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,720
to talk about product and development

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,980
and but luckily in quite a different way

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,170
to the way that Sharon talked about it

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,390
in fact I think your talk is basically a

00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,669
list of things to do for me so that's

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,950
actually quite a quite well timed

00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:33,770
personally I'm going to talk about what

00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:37,190
it's like to be the sole developer on a

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,500
project on a product actually and then

00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,239
kind of transition through building a

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,880
team and then turning into a product

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:48,800
manager so I guess kind of what you were

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:51,680
suggesting that people could do so first

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,060
bit of context and so we are a software

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,200
company we build digital publishing

00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,270
software which powers and things like

00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,860
national newspapers weekly monthly

00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:05,210
magazines education staff internal comms

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,890
anything where you want to like publish

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,909
a bunch of content on a regular basis

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,350
and we've spent the companies like five

00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:14,540
years old we've spent the first fake

00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,609
three or four years doing client based

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,670
projects and in fact one of my clients

00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:24,170
is in the room here say okay I'm not

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,700
gonna be read about clients fee and yeah

00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,749
so we're doing lots of custom client

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,460
projects and and we realized after a

00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:33,859
while that actually people generally

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,249
don't want to be supporting custom code

00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:39,530
and have to do loads of development just

00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:41,209
to get a relatively simple publishing up

00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,350
out there so we started creating

00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:46,999
products that that work out the box and

00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:49,969
can effectively just be colored in and

00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:51,259
then used and so we started with the

00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,209
native apps and then we moved on to

00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,189
looking at the authoring tools to create

00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:57,170
your content and also distribution

00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:58,549
service to actually get your content out

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,350
there which would also look after things

00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:05,090
like analytics and your CDN or what kind

00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,999
of stuff so completely everything is

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,009
done for you I'm going to talk about the

00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:11,930
authoring part of that today because

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:15,790
that's the the product that I work on

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,810
and and that is called pug big express

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,830
it's an authoring tool that allows you

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,970
to create and publish beautiful

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,660
responsive content for your app

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,310
them and and this is a super simple

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,350
diagram of the the structure of express

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,450
so it allows you to create different

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,160
types of content and you can import them

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,600
from a different place as well and it

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,900
also allows you to customize that

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,110
content so a non-techie person can go in

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,610
and select from an array of skins which

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,650
is like the look and feel of a content

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,720
they can pick highlight colors they can

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,340
do all kinds of stuff like that and then

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,530
with a bit of development skills you can

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,790
add custom fonts custom CSS and do some

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,670
custom layouts so they're like different

00:02:51,790 --> 00:03:00,670
levels of customization that you can

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:07,090
apply and it's built on WordPress to

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:09,070
WordPress and um because it's there it's

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,140
kind of a familiar tool to lots of

00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,420
people ready and so some of your

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,970
training some for you there's a good

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,580
plug-in ecosystem out there so lots of

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:22,930
things already done for you and of

00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:25,810
course it's free ah and so it's become

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,550
pretty flexible and it allows you to

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,070
create cities were three of our current

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,420
clients and cyclists on the left and

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,110
that's just a completely out of the box

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,360
template John Lewis edition magazine in

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,130
the middle and their guy the looks after

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,440
it as a developer so he does some custom

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,750
stuff in there and then on the right

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,030
here this is a yachting magazine it's

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,769
really good read actually like their

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,560
loads of yachting gadgets you just would

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:52,090
never knew existed like you can visit an

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,709
inflatable swimming pool so if you're

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,360
out in the middle of the sea you can

00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,280
blow this thing up and they it like make

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,530
like a five by five swimming pool in the

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:06,910
middle of the sea like I don't worry

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:09,040
word that you can okay um and so like

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,470
any good Tarantino movies very similar

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,330
don't hear me I'm gonna start mystery

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,489
not chronologically but in the middle

00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:19,269
sorry at the most traumatic part which

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:22,390
happens to be the middle when everything

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,150
sucked and this is a bit of an awkward

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,560
thing to say about your job and

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,479
especially when you still work for the

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,840
same company and your clients are in the

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,840
room and

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,880
and then also you decide to do a

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,710
run-through of your talk the day before

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
just so you can make sure it's going to

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,200
go okay and then you realize you're

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,660
saying this in front of your colleagues

00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,310
um but yeah so why did everything suck

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,960
and this was at the point where the

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,610
product was in full full swing for

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,700
development swing and and when I look

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,190
back now with hindsight i can see that i

00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,010
can see why i started feeling like this

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,740
and it was because i was working on the

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,970
product of my own um and I didn't have a

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,550
team around me like I wasn't working

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,220
with developer other developers or

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,380
designers or anything like that I think

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,660
maybe I was a product developer because

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,550
i was driving the product and developing

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,120
the product I've just learnt that phrase

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:23,690
now me gay oh right cool I'm gonna use

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,310
it uh and this so i found and i think

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,130
this is probably applicable to anybody

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:31,700
working on a project of any kind on

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:34,160
their own for a long time and or maybe

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,220
not maybe that's just me hardly but so I

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,090
found it was easy I it was easy to get

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,440
bored and therefore lazy and I think

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,000
this is because I didn't have

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,580
interaction with other people on a daily

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,420
basis there weren't other people who

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:53,600
knew the product like I did and and who

00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,310
I could go to with questions and have

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,480
discussions about really easily there

00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,040
was this kind of barrier between

00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,120
everybody else because they didn't know

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:04,310
the ins and outs of the product and

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,050
there were no deadlines the difference

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,120
in working on kind of client projects

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,050
and working with multiple clients at a

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,090
time on relatively short time scales and

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,950
at certain times there's like a really

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,620
fast paced environment I imagine a bit

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,390
more like an agency to then suddenly

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,890
work in one product the whole time on my

00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,340
own just seemed really stark and I had

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:33,020
to do my own time management basically

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:35,540
and it meant that I had to plan my time

00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,950
and then actually follow my plan to get

00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,930
 done otherwise I just didn't um I

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:45,530
had limited resources because it was

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,249
just me as no one to ask and nothing

00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,609
changes

00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:51,919
you go on holiday for like a week or two

00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:53,089
and you come back you ok base is exactly

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,489
the same as it was when you left

00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:57,589
nothing's been fixed and nothing's been

00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:58,849
finished and you knew that because you

00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:02,329
didn't hand it over to anyone when you

00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:04,549
left but kind of hope that maybe the

00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:06,919
like code fairies would pop in and just

00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:11,839
like fix that reg ex so you know no one

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:13,789
ah you didn't and yeah sorry but yeah

00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,649
just making it up making it all up and I

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:20,979
think it's easier to make it up with

00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:25,339
other people and on your own and so

00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:27,829
that's the dramatic part but it wasn't

00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:29,149
like that in the beginning and so

00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:30,619
there's a little time on the bottom here

00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,569
but I realize now the bottom isn't the

00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:36,729
best place for it you can't really see

00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:39,229
it but we're at the beginning now um and

00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:40,789
it was really exciting and the idea of

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:43,459
building a product was really exciting

00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:45,289
and I'd been working on similar types of

00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:49,059
things for a few years so I felt like I

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:53,539
had the expertise to do this well and

00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:56,709
making decisions was easy because and it

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:59,539
was just me and I was you know kind of

00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:01,389
able to do all this kind of stuff which

00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:03,289
meant that it went really quickly so

00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:06,289
because I could make the decisions

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:09,079
immediately I made fast progress and I

00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:12,529
wasn't faffing with JIRA sorry ponete

00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:15,499
managers I just had her to-do list it's

00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,329
nice and no designed by committee and I

00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:19,009
had control over the whole code base so

00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:22,399
it seemed like this really nice thing

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:27,949
that I owned and yeah it's going really

00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:29,509
well and then it kind of dawned on me

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,559
that I was making a product that people

00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,750
are going to use some people are going

00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:35,930
to see and they're going to do that for

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:39,139
it for a long time hopefully and I

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,909
realized how naming things is really

00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:42,680
hard like I know we all say that no me

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,720
thinks is hard anyway it's really hard

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,250
when you know people are going to be

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:54,100
looking at those those words that you've

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:58,040
chosen to describe this product so I

00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,839
mentioned the skins earlier and so this

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,709
is part of the customization

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,220
functionality that you have with an

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:09,100
express and so you can picture the scene

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,319
we're like building towards be one and

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,720
we have a bunch of partners and clients

00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:14,949
that have come in and we're presenting

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,870
to them about all the stuff that we're

00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,519
there what we're the changes that were

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,910
making product and very exciting things

00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,980
that we're working on and i'm talking

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,019
about how Express amazing expresses and

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,899
everything that it does and the day

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:31,360
finishes and that's lovely and we get an

00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:34,990
email later that evening from one of our

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,880
partners and he says it all sounds

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,910
really good but you might want to think

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,130
about making one more skin you know

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,750
build another skin because people don't

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:47,139
really want to hear about four skins all

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,630
the time I was so humiliated I can you

00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:51,819
cannot believe how many times I said

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,769
four skins like I know I'm saying again

00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:57,310
and I'm doing it to myself but it's

00:09:53,769 --> 00:10:00,399
ridiculous yeah apparently no one around

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,209
me nature's died their wishes I don't

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,560
know whether to believe them or not

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:06,639
maybe they're lying to me I'm not sure

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:10,630
but anyway yeah my CA wasn't super

00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,279
payable and that's not the only problem

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,449
on this slide they unfortunately I

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,089
didn't if you can figure out the other

00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:19,029
thing that might be wrong with this when

00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:23,410
we talk internally about em this part of

00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:24,910
product we because it's you know part of

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,279
our day to day we just refer to the

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,189
skins by their name so clean brand

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,230
whatever when other people talk about it

00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:35,110
like our clients and stuff they tend to

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:41,100
save the whole phrase so clean skin

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:44,649
brown skin dark skin I was like what

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,660
yeah really awkward insensitive terrible

00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,389
like that yeah sorry bad so that's

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,519
changing name but it's the kind of thing

00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:53,680
that you don't realize you don't hear it

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,060
when you say it yourself and when

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,490
someone says it back to you suddenly

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:01,259
realize well you've named your product

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,339
yeah and everything's is really hard and

00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,110
so we're back here in the middle now

00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:07,420
when everything starts it starts really

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,779
well things kind of progressed we were

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,230
doing presentations and stuff and but

00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:18,040
then I was working my own for too long

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:20,660
and everything start to suck so I did um

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,350
what I recommend everyone should do when

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,480
this happens and I went on holiday said

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,400
yeah sorry i was going on the limits i

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:34,160
went on hill Dana did some yoga in front

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:36,260
of the sea felt much better and it also

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,170
happened to coincide with Grayson our

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,810
team so we hired to junior and

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,280
developers and that meant then we

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,690
rearranged the seating plan so he

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,480
actually made a nice table of like

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,480
front-end design server we had a good

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,070
mix of people and and people had

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,380
actually gone live on the product by

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,660
this point so there was kind of

00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,130
excitement about what people are doing

00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,930
with this stuff that we've made and how

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:04,220
they're how they using in all that kind

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:06,920
of stuff and so the logical step at this

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:11,300
point was for me to step away from the

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:15,110
code so spend my time kind of figuring

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:17,000
out where the product should go and kind

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,680
of helping other people work on it and

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,040
learn the code base and figure out how

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:26,240
things should go and I think that's so

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,310
right I suppose this is the key point

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,470
this is the point when I kind of shift

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,320
role from being a full-time developer

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:37,970
that's all I do just a developer and

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,490
people saying it to being a like techy

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,400
product manager developer II kind of

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,770
person and helping these juniors get

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,270
going and and doing all that kind of

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,960
stuff and I think what helped with that

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:53,030
role shift was the break because I think

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,300
if you go home on a friday at six and

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:58,700
you comment on a monday at nine ish you

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,320
is going to be really difficult just to

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:05,060
do a completely different thing and and

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,210
while i was away luckily everyone had

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:11,080
got stuck in to the code base which

00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,310
again is a bit of a funny thing because

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:18,500
when you have been writing something for

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:20,480
ages and you finally finally let other

00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,220
people look at it it feels a bit like

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,560
someone's going to your bedroom drawers

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,810
without you in the room and it's the

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,960
crate from mark jones

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:33,730
daily I couldn't be here yeah it's just

00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,140
really weird and you know you know

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,790
because it's going to be like when you

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,490
look at somebody else's code and you

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,260
pick out all the crap bits and you're

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,270
like why do they do like that and you

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,190
also know in your code where all the

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,990
terrible things are and you know the

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,330
like horrible function names and all

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,430
that kind of stuff and yeah so something

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,800
just really weird about people kind of

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,230
looking at it when you're not there but

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,070
so for me the big changes that I noticed

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,779
when and I kind of made that role shift

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,150
but that I had to start coordinating

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,990
things so people in work matching the

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:10,300
right people with the right bits of work

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:12,400
sewing out releases which I had been

00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,350
doing anyway but now other people's code

00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:19,870
is going into my releases so I'm like

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:21,460
mmm it's bit weird and coms about the

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,170
new features so making sure everybody

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,339
knows what is that we're doing a release

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:30,460
thing we're going to be doing next and

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:32,080
what kind of stuff handling feature

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,320
aggress and future planning feature

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,770
acress come from anywhere like CEO

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,140
creative director project managers

00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:44,410
anyone in the company and then of course

00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,790
clients as well and yeah and actually I

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,890
think it's really nice i really like

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:51,310
getting feature requests but i suppose

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:53,830
the thing that m you have to learn is

00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:56,260
how to say no how and when to say no and

00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,940
what to plan in and and for me that's

00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,230
the i suppose the kind of process that

00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,570
i'm going to be now just figuring out

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:07,510
how to sort through all of that and

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:09,070
feedback that I'm getting shining I get

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,420
to introduce shiny new things so if I

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,310
decide that we should do a different

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,800
workflow then we get to do a new

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,890
different workflow which I like and

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,750
saying now I already mentioned and I now

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,690
spend my time in different tools so I

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,640
just felt like I had to have some code

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,920
in here because otherwise they would be

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,970
weird so there's a little bit of a HTML

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,970
with some massages so rather than

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,800
spending my time in sublime I still do

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,950
spend time and survived by also spent a

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,860
lot of time in JIRA faffing

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,300
and yea and things like Trello for

00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,860
roadmapping I don't know what kind of

00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,270
tools you use for a my thing but we're

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,190
the men were using Trello which is

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:54,270
pretty cool and slack I'm on slack a lot

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:57,670
answering questions asking questions

00:15:54,270 --> 00:16:01,990
figuring out what the question means all

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:04,330
that kind of stuff and finally we're a

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,000
team so it's really nice to look back

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,950
now and see that recognize that low

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,180
point and kind of just be able to say

00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,430
that actually I wasn't having a very

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:16,710
good time because now we're a team and

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:20,170
it's going really well and we have the

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,880
kind of well so we've introduced a bunch

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,650
of stuff this is how I was feeling

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,720
before and this is that what the kind of

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,370
thing we're up to now so where we've got

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,840
a proper workflow we're doing pull

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,730
requests for doing code reviews all that

00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,090
kind of stuff we do regularly releases

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,770
as much as possible and and we are going

00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,530
to try and what where it was continuous

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,270
development we've got visual regression

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,700
tests and we're working on unit testing

00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,310
so it's kind of all becoming real a

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,530
space and we're looking into creating a

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,060
user community as well and which if

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,330
anyone has ever done I'd be really

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,040
interested to know what you use and how

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,970
it went and things went out because I've

00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:02,170
never done that before and yeah be cool

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:06,120
and so my conclusions are after telling

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:11,230
you my tail working on your own is hard

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:17,370
holidays are good and products the best

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:17,370
when they're made by many sorry

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,630
