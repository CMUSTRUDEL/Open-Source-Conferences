Title: Putting more D in PRODUCT - Front-end London (FEL)
Publication date: 2016-07-14
Playlist: Front-End London
Description: 
	Developers often feel like they're the last to hear what's on the product roadmap, let alone having a chance to influence what gets built. Yet they're often full of great ideas and have a lot to add to product development discussions. In this talk, Sharon Anne Keane shares some tips on how to get a say in what gets built and ultimately have more impact on the product you work on.

This talk was part of the Front-end London (FEL) May 2016 event.

hi everyone and thanks very much for

00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,619
listening in advance and a couple of

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,720
things before I got here I didn't

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:23,300
realize that someone else had cleverly

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,740
picked a very similar topic so it's a

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,720
little bit two for one tonight but

00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,000
hopefully in a good way minds perhaps

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,099
more of a intro and the other ones a

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,840
sort of retaliation in how it really

00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:35,149
should be maybe but more on that later

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,920
and I guess the other thing to mention

00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:40,420
is anyone who read the title of my talk

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,800
earlier it's been discreetly changed for

00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:46,510
obvious reasons if you read the earlier

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:51,530
titles so please don't judge me I'm

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:54,769
right let me just quickly and i guess

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,809
some developer to product is kind of the

00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:59,690
title of what i'm going to talk about

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:03,010
but it's more about sort of putting the

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,180
elements of developer into product and

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,800
kind of the other way around for the

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,250
mutual benefit of both so that's sort of

00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,380
the tone and hopefully it's useful and i

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:16,490
guess i had a quick question before i

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,110
start which is how many developers among

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,030
you I mean I presume most of your

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,820
developers but how many would sort of

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:27,250
describe yourself as a product developer

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,250
rather than a sort of pure developer

00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,880
okay cool good just some gauging how to

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:36,890
pitch it so and ok I'll get going and I

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,390
i woke up lumen wild I guess that's the

00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,399
other bit of context um I'm Sharon

00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,619
obviously I'm head of product to bloom

00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,140
and wild and then what that means is

00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:49,189
that i'm sort of responsible for tech UX

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,990
and product and when I tell you a bit

00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:53,390
more about what I think sort of product

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,159
is that would kind of make sense but I'm

00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:00,740
probably a bit more text than most

00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:03,380
product people so yeah and a little bit

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,000
of background and blooming wild and for

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,049
anyone who doesn't know who bloom WADA's

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,410
which is probably most people because

00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:11,360
we're a really tiny startup and we are a

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,070
florist essentially but a kind of modern

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,560
florist in that we use technology to

00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,720
make it easier to buy flowers and a bit

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,860
nicer and a bit more cool and actually

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,110
makes the flowers a bit better as well

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,190
because we speed everything up and we

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,750
put them in boxes and they go to your

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,069
letter boxes and that's the kind of

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,590
floral bit of it which is not

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:29,180
my specialism and there's a whole lot of

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,859
technology behind the scenes that powers

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,439
that there's there's a website which is

00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:35,269
a front end probably probably front end

00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,639
interest more than the rest of it which

00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:40,280
is a JavaScript app and angular single

00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:42,200
page app that does the majority of our

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,500
sales it's sort of an e-commerce

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,510
platform and we've got a ruby API Ruby

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,219
on Rails API behind that which is sort

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,510
of see on top of various bits of

00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:53,480
technology that do things like

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,370
deliveries bookings orders and all the

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,829
sort of tech inside the actual flower

00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,719
place where they put the boxes together

00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:01,069
we've also got native apps for iOS and

00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,650
Android so we've got quite a range of

00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:06,230
technologies we've got nine people in

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,459
the tech team out of 25 in total so

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,430
we're actually quite a tech focused

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,799
business and but distinctly floral as

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,870
well as I'll try and communicate a

00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,280
little bit of purposes ok and before

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,870
that I've worked for zopo which is a

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,150
peer-to-peer lender so much more techie

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,519
I've worked for cancer research which is

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,790
charity and I've also worked for golf

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,120
okay and a bit further back in Australia

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,709
for sort of a maybe a bit of a lower

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,689
level equivalent city of Melbourne so

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,819
I've done all sorts of different sectors

00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:38,269
but the consistent thing is the job of

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:40,280
products and tech and so I think I'm

00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:45,819
well-rounded but i'll let you judge that

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,780
and ok so i should have done that before

00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:50,359
that's that's kind of what I just said

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,759
I'm a bit about the tech team I guess

00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:54,470
the thing I didn't mention actually is

00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:58,250
sort of a bit about our room how we do

00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,389
take a bloomin wild which i think is you

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,340
know I think we do it pretty well I

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:03,560
probably would say that the little

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,840
centres at the end is our kind of mantra

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,090
or I don't know what you want to call it

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,189
like our mission statement and coded

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,739
with care compiled with love and shipped

00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:14,540
with pride and it's a little bit a sort

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,909
of a tech version of the bloomin wild

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,130
statement which I'm struggling to

00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:20,539
remember because I'm nervous but it's a

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,280
sort of terrified version of that and it

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:24,169
basically means we we really care about

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,090
the code we really care about the

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:29,599
product which is get the flowers and the

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,710
customer experience and we really you

00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,719
know that permeates through everything

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,669
we do we make sure the processes work

00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:36,320
for the people in the team we make sure

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:37,529
we pick and choose the right tools for

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,839
the right reasons

00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:43,169
the decisions we make kind of take these

00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,939
these values into account and that's

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,609
definitely going to sort of permeate

00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,889
through the tips or things that I'm

00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:51,599
going to talk about which around you

00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,269
know how can you be more product focused

00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:55,829
if you're a developer and you want to or

00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:57,779
how can you work more easily with

00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,879
product managers if that's what you want

00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,919
to do or how can you understand product

00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:07,889
managers a bit more if that's your

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:10,019
position as a developer so so first

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,759
thing what is product and if I'm

00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,739
teaching people to suck eggs sort of

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,299
wave at me or throw things at me but I

00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:17,129
thought it was well worth trying to

00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:21,299
explain it because it is a bit sort of

00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:23,639
miss Steve mystical it's kind of a lot

00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:25,649
of things but you know bringing them

00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,839
together perhaps is the best way to

00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:29,579
describe it and you sort of sit in the

00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,649
middle of primarily things like you x

00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,469
tekken business and by business i mean

00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:36,509
kind of hard goals corporate numbers

00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:37,889
that sort of stuff i think everyone

00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,959
knows what UX and tech kids so i'm not

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:42,329
going to talk about explaining that bit

00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,860
more and around those things there's

00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:45,599
other things like marketing and

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,119
operations and customer services and

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,669
flowers in our case and other things in

00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:51,959
other cases they're all important too

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,419
and they're all part of it but this is

00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,039
sort of the epicenter and it's really

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,110
about coordinating those things to get

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,529
the best kind of product out at the end

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,899
and to a greater or lesser degree you

00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,819
probably focus on one of those things as

00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:07,619
a product manager I think for me if I

00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,899
was going to put myself on that diagram

00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:12,539
I would be at the top between UX and

00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,159
tech but obviously I have to get the

00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,029
business bit as well but if I had you

00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:16,999
know if I had to pick a favorite

00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:20,159
probably it would be the top two and

00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:21,899
what product is not is Gantt charts and

00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,449
project management and kind of

00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,129
traditional IT structures and all of

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,349
those sorts of things I'm that's not my

00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:31,499
background I've never worked in that

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:33,239
kind of team and those teams exist and

00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:35,489
they do great things in many instances

00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:37,739
but it's not what I would describe as

00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:38,669
product and I think quite often product

00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:40,259
managers probably struggle in that

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,929
environment because it's quite different

00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,609
it's quite regimented you have very long

00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:46,800
lead times you have very slow release

00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:48,779
cycles you don't have any agility or any

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,290
of the nice things that I've come to

00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:54,480
enjoy in the places I've worked

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,800
so that's what I think product is but

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,960
very open to challenge on that and

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,060
anyone who wants to talk to me about

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,090
product i'll happily chat over beers for

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,639
hours about it and so why should

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,290
developers be interested in this and I

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,150
mean you have to work with them right so

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,070
much as you hate product managers if you

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,900
do hate them you have to work with them

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,540
so that's that's one sort of very kind

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,610
of hard and fast reason and but some

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,780
more positive reasons you might be

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,060
interested in it you might be interested

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,320
in becoming a product manager or doing a

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,630
paps half-and-half job where you're a

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,800
product developer maybe or something

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,320
that's sort of in between or aux

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,090
engineer I think the boundary start to

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,400
blur quite a lot when you you know when

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,750
you have interests and bring them into

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,330
your role and have the freedom to do

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,400
that you might be a founder or a future

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,050
founder I think increasingly people

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,340
learn to code because they want to start

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,840
their own business like it happens

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,419
happening everywhere particularly in the

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,650
startup scene I feel like it's a massive

00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,330
trend it might be different if you're

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,880
not working in a start-up I don't know

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,669
but I think it's a massive thing at the

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,229
moment and you could be a UX focus

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:57,270
developer and I think particularly front

00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,229
Enders like this is almost obvious right

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,120
you can't really avoid it if you're

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:03,810
designing and building interfaces like

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,910
they're going to be used so you you have

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,729
to be interested in it hopefully you're

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,110
passionate about it as well and again on

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,250
this perhaps on the negative side you

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,780
might be a bit fed up with tenant being

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,849
told what to do and you've got some

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,800
project manager or maybe even a product

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:19,080
manager who's saying just do this here's

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,039
a spec off you go actually you're

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,539
thinking well I know the customers

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,039
better I know the product better I know

00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,590
how to build this technology quicker

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:30,030
more efficiently I can do it better I

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:32,070
think you know hopefully try it and the

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,630
final one I guess I sort of mentioned

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,000
this already actually the two go

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,440
together I guess if you feel like you're

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,029
doing it better than the person who

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,990
should be doing it oh sorry if you feel

00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:43,320
like you're doing it better than the

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,760
person who is meant to be doing it yeah

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,010
I think that's that can be a big

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,900
motivating factor to go and perhaps

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:52,620
dabble in the dark arts of product

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,630
management again I kind of mentioned

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,610
this but I think for front-end visits is

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,589
much more common you so much nearer to

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,600
to the product to the kind of the

00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,760
usability the purpose of it the

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,290
customers the bits that they actually

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,630
use the buttons they click weather

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:12,209
it's you know what whatever that kind of

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:15,899
interaction there is so I've got ten

00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:18,060
slides now ten things that I think you

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,910
could look into if you wanted to learn

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,199
more about product in any of those kind

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,389
of for any of those reasons and i just

00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:26,459
mentioned or to any of those degrees so

00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,649
the first one is the roadmap which i

00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,209
think is kind of everywhere like there's

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:33,300
always a roadmap even if it's a rubbish

00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:34,620
roadmap there's always a roadmap and you

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,420
know i think most people know what it is

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,620
but if you don't find out because you're

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,610
not really going to get very far until

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:44,250
you do that get to know it ask questions

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,130
you know if there's if there's not

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,569
enough detail ask for more detail and

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,709
product managers really like being asked

00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:51,839
about the road map because it's their

00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:54,120
pride and joy it's kind of the summary

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,130
of all their hard work they toil over

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,350
these analytics and this user feedback

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,810
and this kind of business direction and

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,180
all these great ideas and they all come

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:06,750
together get shuffled around and out

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,250
pops a road map hopefully so I think if

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,720
you ask a product manager about the road

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,860
map and they don't want to talk about it

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,970
then something's really wrong and I

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,470
guess the other thing is you know after

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,060
why and Challenger if you think

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,230
something shouldn't be on it or if you

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,269
think something should be on it that's

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,029
not on it tell the product manager or

00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:26,819
tell the person who owns it and I think

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:29,069
yeah it's a good thing I wish developers

00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:31,740
in my team now and in past teams that

00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:33,959
I've been in did that more and it's good

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,310
for me to be challenged I might disagree

00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,350
with them and I think that's fine I

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,510
might agree with them that's even better

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,209
I guess and but I think it's a good

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,589
thing I think asking why and challenging

00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:46,260
the person who's making these decisions

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,819
is a really positive thing I can't

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,350
promise it always go well though not all

00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:51,750
product managers a good product managers

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:56,550
it's it's like anything in life they're

00:10:51,750 --> 00:11:00,569
human so the next one metrics I alluded

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,889
to this on the road map and you know get

00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:04,050
near to them if you're interested in

00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:06,060
products look at numbers don't just kind

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,579
of make assumptions I think that's an

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,199
incredibly frustrating thing for me as a

00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,579
product manager to see in developers

00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:13,260
that I work with you can be a great

00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:15,240
developer but if you're making

00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,980
assumptions that inform the decisions

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,910
you take when you build something it can

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,240
be really dangerous

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,580
get some data it's always there and some

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,080
companies do it more than others so it

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,870
might not always be there but it should

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,000
be you know use numbers or qualitative

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,480
data which is obviously the opposite so

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,770
you know words and pictures perhaps mix

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,810
the two together go for the one that's

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,750
easiest the most relevant but you know

00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:42,780
find out why things are happening and

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,950
then what to what degree and you're

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,660
probably not going to get very far

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,310
challenging someone about the roadmap

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,290
unless you have numbers or something

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,450
other than your opinions back it up

00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,910
unless you're the CEO and that's yeah

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,140
it's kind of their privilege but really

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,700
they've probably got the numbers they

00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,140
just might not look like it I think it's

00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,640
you might be in a horrible situation

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,770
where you've got someone who's saying

00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,590
right no not listening to you is my

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,640
decision and they're not based on data

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,970
that's probably a terrible place to be

00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,770
and but i think it's like such an

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,410
important part of doing the product

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,420
roars it's kind of your second brain

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,220
almost like it's you know you just have

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,510
to rely on this thing to help you make

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,060
your judgments because otherwise you'll

00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,950
stop going off on tangents there that

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,070
could be completely disastrous for the

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:29,280
company or yourself or if you're the

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,370
owner and I really were before at the

00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,450
top there and metrics are really

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,960
important when you're planning and

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:40,140
putting stuff on a road map and and

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,970
after as well so after it's kind of

00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,740
different because I think you'll use

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,120
something you're built you've built and

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,400
you then go and measure it so it's

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,560
perhaps a little bit less scattergun

00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,330
it's a bit more focused and but equally

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,700
important and it also powers the road

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,380
map so you build something you hopefully

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:59,280
are interested in how its performing so

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,110
do it yeah do that more and I think

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,550
interesting thing to add here this is

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,020
this is something that is usually like

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,480
pushing an open door developers love

00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,490
stats like I think if you're technically

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,430
inclined it's generally the case that

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:15,150
you like data and know how to find it

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:17,220
and process it to a degree product

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,990
managers generally don't have as many

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,130
technical skills as developers so if

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,510
developers come to them and say look

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,730
I've found this data I want to help

00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,590
build this stuff up and give you this

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,820
insight and work with you on it it's

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,930
going to be like pushing an open door

00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,620
and it's going to make you a much more

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,620
effective team

00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,859
the other thing I was going to mention

00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:37,709
and again this was I was sort of judging

00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:39,179
how to push how to pitch this but some

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,429
of the tools that we could use to do

00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,709
this and this might be just like

00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:45,479
teaching suck eggs but an insight into

00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:47,099
how we work at bloomin wild we use the

00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:49,349
obvious ones or I think they're obvious

00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:51,209
like Google Analytics and obviously our

00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:54,419
database that's full of exciting data

00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:57,149
and but things like mixpanel user

00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:59,399
testing the whole range like we kind of

00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:02,519
are quite lean because we're small and

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,989
young but no I think you know we can go

00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,419
to town and there's all sorts of tools

00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:08,519
that will help you find the data that

00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:10,799
you need and it's a case of picking the

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,779
right one most of the time is the

00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,829
biggest challenge because there are so

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,389
many you could spend your whole life

00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:17,389
kind of running around in circles food

00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:24,179
number four hopefully I'm sorry I am I

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,919
tactically added in animated gifts to

00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,509
this this afternoon when my team told me

00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,479
that it was too black and white and

00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:33,059
boring so sorry I keep forgetting to

00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:35,309
press the button and they do have a sort

00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:37,079
of coin meaning and what's that one

00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:38,729
reward for the team that was that i

00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,350
haven't mentioned so yeah so date is

00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:41,939
great because if it if it's going well

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:46,889
and you prove it's going well everyone's

00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:49,470
happy and it's like a cat high five next

00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:52,289
one I get to know the customers and

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,749
actually I of most of the places that

00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:56,459
I've worked as a product manager

00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:59,519
developers more than most people seem to

00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:02,249
really value the custom of you and I

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,299
don't know why particularly I mean I

00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:05,970
think it's a good thing right I'm not

00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:08,699
saying you're questioning the value of

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,689
it but more than teams you know the you

00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,549
know the teams that you have my

00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:13,049
marketing operations i'm not going to

00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:14,279
suggest which ones I think are good or

00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:16,679
bad other than that I think developers

00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:18,539
January are really good at this they

00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,669
want to know what the customer is doing

00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,319
the thing they've built and you know I

00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:24,059
think the more we do that the better

00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:28,019
it's a really really good thing it's an

00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:30,539
extra pair of is an eyes on the sort of

00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:33,029
outside world that's informing the stuff

00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:34,919
that you build in the future so knowing

00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:37,559
how it's used what works doesn't work I

00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,029
guess this some this is a the next one's

00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,859
a bit of a luxury if you happen to have

00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,779
a bit of spare time which I don't think

00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:44,309
anyone ever does but it might be a way

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,279
to sort of find new ideas and

00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,769
opportunities that you

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,939
even know existed that he isn't

00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,949
listening to customer calls and they're

00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:52,449
talking about something that just isn't

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,060
even on the roadmap wasn't even in the

00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:57,610
product and that could be something that

00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,050
you get from there and again I kind of

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,209
alluded to talk I think this is probably

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,860
a little bit obvious and I think one

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:06,249
thing that actually is worth mentioning

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,709
at bluemoon wild we always listening to

00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:10,569
customer calls and when I say we I mean

00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:13,059
the whole team so there's 25 of us

00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:15,100
across all disciplines 9 Tech and the

00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:17,079
rest marketing operations etc and

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,540
obviously a customer services team who

00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:22,300
do that full time at some point each

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,709
week we all spend at least an hour doing

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,240
some kind of engagement customers

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,639
whether it's answering emails or being

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,350
on the phone and I think everyone has

00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:31,569
taken a call at some point which is

00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,370
easier and harder for some people I

00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:34,569
quite struggled with that I joined them

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,699
while didn't know anything about flowers

00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:40,600
and had to talk to little old ladies

00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:42,279
about roses and peonies and ya didn't

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,949
know what to do so I found emails easier

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,300
but whatever way it is I think it's

00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:48,999
something that is really worth

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,009
championing as a product manager and as

00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:52,000
a developer if you say to someone that I

00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,559
want to know more about what the

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,259
customers are saying it's a it's a

00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,730
really good thing that one's not

00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:59,769
animated that's a dog and one of our

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,360
flower boxes that's what our customers

00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,649
do with our flower boxes they kind of

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,179
take photos of them when they land on

00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:06,220
the doorstep it's an interesting

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:12,069
observation it's not influenced our tech

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:14,230
yet but we'll see this one get to know

00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,299
the problems and this is kind of flowing

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,819
on from the customers bit and the kind

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:20,260
of date a bit when you've got all this

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,750
data and you're sort of hearing all this

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,549
feedback think about what are the things

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,559
that are actually stopping people from

00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,850
either having a good experience or maybe

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,789
even stopping them from using your

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,230
product it could be something like a say

00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:33,520
a button is broken on a website and that

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,419
stops you ordering I mean that's not

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,890
going to happen because that's a major

00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:37,840
one someone would find that but

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,090
something that stops people actually

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,520
using your product is is really bad and

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:46,929
it's an obvious problem so you know

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,840
identify it and enlist it that's yeah I

00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:52,450
think internally and externally you can

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,399
have have problems that you know that

00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,010
you can find out about and potentially

00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:58,690
help solve as a technologist and whether

00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,110
it's processes that are going to slowly

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,290
or

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,330
too much manual effort going into them

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,830
yeah can be all sorts of things and as a

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,510
developer you're in probably the most

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,720
powerful position to be able to solve

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:13,480
these things and tech businesses their

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,059
whole kind of business is is digital and

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:20,650
you know if the digital thing has

00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:23,650
problems in it oh sorry yeah if there

00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:25,480
are problems you know developers are the

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,790
people that end up fixing them so if you

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,790
can help identify them it's a really

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:33,309
positive thing and I guess from a

00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:35,410
business point of view which I'm always

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:37,780
aligned with the UX and tech more than

00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,250
the business it's a good thing because

00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,780
it things move faster and people are

00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,910
happy and you know in the end of the day

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,710
the business that you work for whether

00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,330
it's your own or someone else's is not

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,580
going to do well unless it moves quickly

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,650
and become successful so you know

00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,690
whether you like cold hard numbers or

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:56,100
not you sort of have to acknowledge them

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,360
and it's a big part of what you do and

00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,160
the other thing that i would add here

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,679
and the reason i keep banging on about

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,480
problems is our roadmap is really a

00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,030
series of problems and it's sort of

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,970
loosely based on this theory or approach

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:12,250
to working called jobs to be done and we

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,510
don't follow any processes religiously a

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,400
bloomin while we're too small for that

00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,780
way we've just kind of have to muck in

00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,990
and get stuff done in the most logical

00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,419
way possible and but this idea of

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,980
focusing on things to solve rather than

00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:26,980
oh I'm going to build this feature or

00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,419
I'm going to do this other thing works

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,710
really well for us because we have to be

00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:34,860
focused and we have to do things really

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:37,600
quickly and efficiently the next one is

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,780
kind of similar but different subtly

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,280
different and if you have problems big

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,290
list of problems to solve on the back

00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,270
logo or wish that you know essentially

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,059
where wherever you store this kind of

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:51,040
to-do list when you actually come to

00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:54,040
work on it focusing on it is really

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,809
important and it can really damage your

00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,230
kind of impact as a developer if you

00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:00,250
don't like everyone has their passion

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,010
absolutely and I think that's really

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:07,300
important whether it's these cats going

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:08,350
to move and whether it's CSS and you

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,390
know as a front end or whether it's

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,580
JavaScript whether you know whatever

00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,649
element of development is the

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,929
your passion is it's worth remembering

00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:19,809
that actually you're solving a problem

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:21,490
because you can go go to town build

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:24,100
these most these beautiful frameworks

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,159
you can make things consistent whatever

00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,059
the thing is that you really want to do

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,380
isn't actually going to help the

00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:33,940
customers sometimes it's a big challenge

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,000
I think and I struggle with it as much

00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,590
as anyone I think it's just go it's a

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,210
really good skill to have and it's

00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,610
something that is really worth working

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:46,179
on if you're interested in product and

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:49,149
being more product focused and the way

00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:50,470
to approach it that works for me is have

00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:51,850
things that are clear problems i just

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,490
mentioned in that backlog is really a

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:58,059
series of things to solve or things to

00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,610
tick off in things to solve things to

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:03,460
conquer and and if they're clear that

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,809
helps you to focus its i guess a sort of

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,990
very lightweight version of having a

00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:10,960
spec and if they're clear their testable

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,789
and all the hypothesis that you've kind

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,750
of formed to solve them are hopefully

00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:19,779
testable and ultimately it's about scope

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,309
I think if you let the scope creep you

00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,860
think things are harder to test things

00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:25,539
take longer to build and ultimately your

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,039
product suffers from it because the

00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:28,210
slower it take the longer it takes you

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,190
to build something and actually get it

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:34,539
in front of a customer the less impact

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:37,990
it has and the next one I mentioned

00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:40,090
business get to know the business you

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,279
have to be in you have to be bought into

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,110
it i think you know you can have your

00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,389
own own agenda in your own interests but

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,279
ultimately the thing you're building is

00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:50,500
for someone whether it's for yourself or

00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:53,080
for another business what are the goals

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,580
of it and what where is it going and you

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,380
know find out find out what the sort of

00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,299
number we're with its number goals or

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,850
something aspirational like all we want

00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:02,440
to go to the moon next month and why has

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,330
stuff been planned who does what who's

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,570
doing it you know why is it is it a

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,700
marketing thing is it a operations thing

00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,289
I think in bigger organizations this is

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,299
probably more of a problem I think at

00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:15,370
bloom and wild there's 25 of us there is

00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:17,260
absolutely no way people will not know

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,870
what our goal is because we talk about

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,789
it every day together if you're in a big

00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,830
place that cancer research with us 5,000

00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:25,419
people it can be really difficult to

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,080
know actually what are the big goals

00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:31,090
where

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:34,480
where are we all going and and be nearer

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,190
the numbers and ultimately if you've got

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,110
goals they should have numbers attached

00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,929
to them sometimes they don't which can

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,090
make it hard but if there are numbers

00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:45,940
then get near to them pay attention to

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:49,090
them see how you're doing and which ones

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,320
are you moving specifically so i'm going

00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,549
to use bloom while as an example because

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,440
that's really all I can think about at

00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:56,049
the moment for obvious reasons it soaks

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,730
up lots of my time and we want to sell

00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:00,460
more flowers that's a very vague goal

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,529
and I think an individual person working

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,120
on an individual task is going to find

00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:06,970
it very hard to relate to that as a very

00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:10,389
big goal but we can do a whole load of

00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,399
little things along the way that's not a

00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,659
moving car so we can do a whole load

00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:16,059
little things along the way that make it

00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:17,889
easier to do lots of flowers we can make

00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:19,750
our supply chain slicker we can make our

00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:22,269
website work faster we can make our appt

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,889
load quicker we can reduce friction in

00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:26,049
the conversion funnel we can make our

00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:27,700
homepage look nicer and more friendly we

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:29,370
can make it work on more devices we can

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,260
make it more supportable so that we can

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:34,450
evolve it faster and adapter stuff like

00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,419
there are so many little goals in there

00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,370
that add up to sell more flowers and so

00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:42,789
think about the ones that you know that

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,600
relate to you and just keep an eye on

00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,220
them and make sure you're actually

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,200
moving them because I think if you're

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,200
not it's probably quite demotivating

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:56,830
number eight next one what's the best or

00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:58,809
the right solution I couldn't decide

00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:02,500
what the best word was there so all the

00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:04,210
right words so I chose both and when you

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,070
were solving a problem or building a

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,529
thing there's usually many ways you can

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:11,080
do it sometimes there's not but

00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:12,909
generally there is and the amount of

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,100
time it takes the amount of effort the

00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:17,169
quality of the thing is it an MVP or is

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,580
it a polished thing is it going to go

00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:20,169
out and phases or are you going to build

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,570
it and then that's it it's going to be

00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,980
like that forever and you know that's

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,820
all really the adds up to be in the

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,139
context and make decisions you know take

00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,549
into account all of those things I think

00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:32,799
as a product manager one of the thing

00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:35,649
you see do all the time is juggle those

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,880
and kind of judge right what is the what

00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:38,500
is the thing that I need to build right

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,020
now is it is it going to be a skeleton

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,470
or is it going

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,670
be something that's really polished

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,230
sometimes an MVP does need to be

00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,300
polished your home page on our website

00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,370
probably needs to look really good you

00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,140
can't just put out a skeleton but a

00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,880
little feature that you're trying out on

00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,710
a small proportion of users perhaps

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,940
doesn't need to be so flashy and

00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:00,500
beautiful and don't be precious and you

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,850
know I think and you everyone can be

00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,770
pressed everyone wants do precious about

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,860
their own area whether it's UX whether

00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:08,240
it's JavaScript whether its product

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,770
management even whether it's the roadmap

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,660
you know do it does the roadmap need to

00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,460
look pixel perfect and have little

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,290
capital letters in the right places and

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,540
does it need to have the right fonts

00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:20,630
like not always now in fact probably

00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,370
never sometimes you precious when it's

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,660
important the numbers in the roadmap

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,840
probably need to be bang on and the

00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:29,450
priority needs to be right then you

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,130
apply that across whatever your precious

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,890
thing is but I think having the

00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:36,110
pragmatism to know when to be precious

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,540
and when not to be is a really important

00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,640
skill and as a product manager I've I

00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:44,120
find that's something that I have to do

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,920
all the time and it leads into the next

00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,020
item the next word that I've put there

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,300
which is empathy and appreciating other

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:54,020
people's sort of precious thing and

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,580
because if someone you know if you might

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,500
upset one someone by saying well no

00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,340
sorry you cannot spend four months

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,450
putting this new CSS framework into our

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,100
technology stack at the moment because

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,570
actually it's not going to help the

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,350
customers with the problem that they

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:12,020
have the person who loves the CSS is not

00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,940
going to like that and so you have to

00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,590
kind of have appreciation for that and

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,820
find a way to deal with it that isn't

00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,400
going to make them walk out the door

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,990
because that would be even worse and I

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,060
think that's probably the hardest bit of

00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,130
the job that I've found from doing it

00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,900
and people are unpredictable they're

00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:29,180
humans you can't always tell how they

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,530
feel you can't always tell what the

00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,280
precious thing is actually if they don't

00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:36,830
tell you so I think okay balancing those

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,600
two things and figuring out what's the

00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,640
best solution whether it's the solution

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,770
technically or the solution in how to

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,510
deal with the situation is really

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:49,400
challenging I've been alluding to this

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,590
one sort of gradually more as I've gone

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,130
through and I really didn't know what

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,600
suppose

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:56,210
title here without sort of sounding like

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,120
a kind of graduate scheme awful person

00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:01,970
which is not what I was intending but

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,800
the people bit of the job I think is the

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,870
thing that really makes a product

00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,760
manager different from someone that's

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,520
more focused on their trade as a

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,810
designer or developer I'm not saying

00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,590
that as a developer you don't have

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,370
people skills like absolutely you do

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,020
what I'm saying is you're going to have

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,330
to use them a lot more if you start

00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,740
working as a product person and you

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,380
actually can't avoid it I think

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:27,200
everything you do involves people and

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,730
you actually you may end up doing a bit

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,770
of people and a bit of your trade still

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,850
but probably the people but is going to

00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,280
be the bit that really gets you the

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,500
winds and you need to get stuff done and

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,120
you can't do it on your own maybe you

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,740
can to start with but ultimately that

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,070
will have us there'll be a shelf life

00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,540
for that and it will it will stop and so

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,710
you therefore need to find other people

00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,940
to work with you whether it's people

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,290
that are going to deploy your code

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,470
whether it's people that are going to QA

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,940
it whether it's I know people that are

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,770
going to help figure out what the best

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,720
solution is and actually get the

00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,810
customers using it so operational type

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,020
stuff getting those things all working

00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:04,850
together is pretty tricky and I think

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,960
you need to have the right skills to go

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:11,720
to deal with people to do that and

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,770
patients as well I think his is a really

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,600
important skill and another one I

00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:17,230
struggle with like I think in instant

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,970
gratification is definitely my style and

00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,940
if I was going to be a photographer I'd

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:26,240
use Polaroid rather than film sort of a

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,710
traditional film but I think you can't

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,300
always get things done straight away you

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,310
might think I can do this on my own

00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,860
right now I'm going to do all the things

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:35,000
that's not scalable you need to accept

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,730
that perhaps it won't take as long that

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,810
someone's got to do something else first

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,660
there's numerous situations where

00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:48,800
patients becomes a really really big

00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:51,710
part of your job that little gif is cat

00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,660
herding which I thought was just better

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,750
splained visually visually than me

00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,900
trying to inarticulately describe the

00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:01,340
other element of what I do every day

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:04,670
there are lots of cats even at a small

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,900
start-up and cats don't heard they just

00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:08,330
go where they want

00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:13,790
unless you find some way of encouraging

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:17,570
them to all go in the same direction not

00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:19,700
something nice okay the final one and

00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,470
this sounds really cheesy and when I

00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,690
talked through this these slides of the

00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,100
guys in my team earlier I kind of got

00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,920
them to proof read them for me and they

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:30,140
absolutely tore me to pieces and one of

00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:36,020
them kindly gave me this gift oh no

00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:37,670
sorry my cats which I thought was quite

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,900
cute and i asked him actually which

00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,950
one's the product manager and which

00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:46,870
one's the developer he said not sure

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:50,060
i'll let you imagine which ones work and

00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,950
make friends with your product manager

00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,480
or a product manager if you don't have

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:58,070
one is my last kind of bit of advice

00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,080
they're doing the job they might tell

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,420
you don't come near it it's absolutely

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,130
horrible or they might give you some

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,110
advice that inspires you or they might

00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,660
give you some tips for how to get into

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:10,790
it and i think anyone else who stood up

00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,170
here and said the same did the same kind

00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,270
of presentation would tell you a whole

00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:16,010
stack of different stuff they might say

00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,980
a few of the same things but there's so

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:23,240
many different elements to it that you

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:25,550
know you kind of have to apply it in the

00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,090
place that you are so i would say go and

00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:32,210
make friends with your PM or a PM in the

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,530
place that you work and the other thing

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,360
they laughed at me about earlier was

00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,350
when when you look at that list it

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,020
actually looks like a kind of

00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:40,780
instruction guide for stalkers and i

00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,480
don't suggest you do all of those things

00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:46,190
on one person at one time maybe pick the

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,950
one that's most appropriate some people

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,420
like being asked some people don't some

00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,040
people would prefer you to fact just

00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:55,040
follow around and keep an eye on them

00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,750
listening asked lots of questions asked

00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,580
how you can help i figure out which

00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,230
one's the best one but i think if you do

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,110
some of those you learn a lot very

00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:05,270
quickly and hopefully get nearer to the

00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,770
product and if if your thing is wanting

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,020
to be a product manager then I think

00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,750
that's the best place to start the

00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,540
health warning that goes with that and

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:16,760
this is a great gift it's bear in mind

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,340
they're busy they're always busy and

00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:22,670
that may mean that they're snappy and

00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:25,250
they don't want to talk to you may mean

00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,990
that they know the things that I just

00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,340
talked about you know cat herding all

00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,810
the different things you coordinate

00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,570
stakeholders whatever you want to call

00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,550
it they're really busy so appreciate

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:38,030
that and you know don't expect them to

00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:42,020
have hours and hours and hours they

00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:44,060
might do what that cat does and the next

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,650
thing they rely on your help like if you

00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,000
if you're in a team and you have a

00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,680
product manager in that team and you're

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,960
developing that team or a designer or

00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,900
whatever are the role they really rely

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,460
on you like don't underestimate that you

00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,900
can't as a product manager you can't get

00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,420
anywhere without the rest of the team

00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,310
doing their thing so be excellent or

00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,840
what you do still be excellent or what

00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,920
you do keep being excellent and then

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,500
offer to take on more responsibility

00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,260
because it's not going to work if you

00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:13,880
kind of dropped the day job too soon it

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:15,500
might sound really obvious but and the

00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,170
last one I sort of made this point

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,970
earlier but the softer skills but the

00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,520
patient's the people but i think is the

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:24,980
hardest bit and i was really rubbish at

00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,210
it a few years ago i'm still not amazing

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,040
at it I don't think I'm anywhere near

00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,200
perfect but I think if there's one thing

00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,750
I've learned and grown up in the past

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:37,010
two years is that bit you can be an

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:39,350
amazing UX designer or a great developer

00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:42,080
or a great business person and you can

00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,940
keep refining those skills but the thing

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,260
that will really make you win and

00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,790
actually get stuff done you know get

00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,470
decisions made which I ultimately mean

00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,900
the thing gets shipped and becomes a

00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,630
success at cetera et cetera is is the

00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,980
soft a bit i'm utterly convinced but if

00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,270
someone has said that's me a couple

00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,610
years ago i've probably laughed at them

00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:03,380
and smirked and said night I go home so

00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:05,420
and and that's it that's 10 things that

00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,430
I would suggest doing to get near as a

00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,830
product and very open to challenge I

00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:11,270
think it's incredibly subjective I think

00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,560
it's different in every place you work

00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:16,850
and that yeah hopefully interesting I

00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,380
did have one sort of cheeky last slide

00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,510
which is the obvious one that we are

00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,800
looking for more developers so come and

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,370
talk to me about that as well as product

00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,430
but mainly about apartment

00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,430
