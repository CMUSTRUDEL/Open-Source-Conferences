Description: 
	Developers often feel like they're the last to hear what's on the product roadmap, let alone having a chance to influence what gets built. Yet they're often full of great ideas and have a lot to add to product development discussions. In this talk, Sharon Anne Keane shares some tips on how to get a say in what gets built and ultimately have more impact on the product you work on.

This talk was part of the Front-end London (FEL) May 2016 event.
