hi so I'm Nikki I work at a company

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,690
called future learn as a technical

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,929
manager right now but before that I was

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,429
a web developer for a long long time and

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:14,519
I'm definitely on the developer end of

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,260
the designer developer skill set I have

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,300
an appreciation and an understanding for

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,590
design but I'm not a designer so I've

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,750
always had to work in a team with other

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,109
designers to ship the products that we

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,949
build together I can't do it on my own

00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,779
so I have a keen interest in

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,400
understanding and helping developers and

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,230
designers work together more closely and

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,480
effectively and this talk is about one

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,649
cool way of doing that so today I want

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,540
to talk about designers and developers

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,399
who want to push their imaginations to

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,719
the limit and push the web to the limit

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,790
and I'm going to talk about how one of

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,050
our most used solutions the base of all

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,000
of the layouts over the years

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,539
grids has served us really well for a

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,219
long time but now it's time to move on

00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,079
so grids are great they work really well

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,360
for lots of reasons we've all been using

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,260
them and building them for years months

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,920
decades some of us from floats tables

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,059
flexbox CSS grid itself why are they so

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,939
important why not just have everything

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,860
in one long column well to answer that

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,590
question we need to go way back in the

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,450
14th century monks were scribbling notes

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,130
in the margins of their manuscripts I

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,810
understand that most of them are fart

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,580
jokes if the Internet is anything to go

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,200
by effectively one long column two

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,490
hundred years later we finally got

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,580
around to inventing the two column

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,790
layout and here you can see the benefits

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,740
immediately of grid layouts this you can

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,210
get way more information on the page the

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,460
previous example was really beautiful

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,000
but this information here is much more

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,009
dense later on in the 50s the grid

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,600
movement sort of exploded and flourished

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,759
and actually was named for the very

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,710
first time and it starts to look a bit

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,170
more familiar to you people who are

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,030
using CSS grids and a little bit more

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,240
similar to the consistent modular

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,470
component systems that we use today and

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,689
in fact this grid was designed for that

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,540
exact reason so that the output the

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,579
product that it was used to design would

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,310
have consistency and be easier to create

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,399
and quicker to reproduce it helps people

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,229
keep their layouts readable it helps

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,410
balance the page it helps make sure that

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,240
one element is not overpowering another

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,660
but there are some bad ways to use grids

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,910
too like this so you can take relying on

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,250
a grid too far this can be a problem

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,530
right and I'm not knocking it the reason

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,630
that we do this it's because it's easy

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,030
on many levels it works it's modular

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,180
it's easy to reproduce but it's also

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,770
quite boring you look at this and you

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,620
see the clue is in the name it's called

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,150
the CSS box model it makes boxes you can

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,680
have the margin wherever you want these

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,440
days but you know they're all the same

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,480
basic shape and design is a discipline

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,040
with this huge rich long history and

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,500
we're not making the most use of it that

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,410
we could and things like this are a

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,540
problem it's really good that excellent

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,190
design and communication tools are

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,560
available now and available to many more

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,260
people via web publishing tools and page

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,420
templates than ever before but the

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,800
benefits of all of that rich history are

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,960
lost when everything starts to look a

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,190
bit sort of similar and say me and you

00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,070
run the risk of not getting your message

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,600
across as effectively as you could and

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,480
it's not just me who thinks this this is

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,780
gen Simmons and she is a designer and

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,100
developer advocate at Mozilla and she's

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,540
doing amazing work at the moment if you

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,190
you know if you want to check out

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,810
anything about CSS grid or CSS shape

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,910
she's one of the people that's really

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,010
pushing the industry in that area this

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,570
is a quote from a web video discussion

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,770
that she did last year on a list apart

00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,750
it's really good you should go and what

00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,209
read and watch the rest of it right

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,400
before she said this she said we're

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,290
copying each other's work too much too

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,480
many things look like medium too many

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,489
things look like Web Design out of 2007

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,910
too many things look like copies of each

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,910
other

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,560
everybody's bored so there is a way to

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,530
make design better on the web

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,300
apparently it's that way so once I

00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,610
started thinking about this I just saw

00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,989
it everywhere this is a page I picked up

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,209
the Evening Standard on my commute and

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,890
immediately this outline around the

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,570
picture drew me in and made me want to

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,720
read the article I found another one on

00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,700
the way here this evening and I got

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,650
curious about the Evening Standard and

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,080
so when I'm looking for the online

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,489
version of this article just to see what

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,109
the difference would be and like what

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:20,580
translation the designers had kind of

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:22,410
gone through on their way into it and

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,669
you can see there's like literally

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,960
nothing I think like the text and that

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,870
picture the only thing that's the same

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,660
which i think is there

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,949
shame and this article really didn't do

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,949
such a good job of drawing me in and

00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,870
making me want to read it and again once

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,310
you start looking you can see examples

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,820
of graphic designers pushing the

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,260
boundaries of print layout everywhere we

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,060
could be doing stuff much more exciting

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,090
like really striking art direction or

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:52,150
having text flow around you know the

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:54,310
lines of things anyway the point of all

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,780
these examples print is pushing the

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,030
boundaries we on the web are lagging

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,669
behind so if we did want to do something

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:04,000
like this and we didn't have CSS shapes

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:06,010
how could we do it well we could go

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,660
super old-school and just chuck

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,460
everything in an image put all your text

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,290
and pictures in there together don't

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,120
want to do this not very accessible not

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,310
very responsive not really very scalable

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,630
a lot of web comics I think is still

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,000
published like this which I think is a

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,320
bit of a shame or if you didn't want to

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,300
go that route you could do it with

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,010
JavaScript you could have every line of

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,139
text in its own span and like position

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,490
them all individually still not very

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,410
scalable probably slightly more

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,330
accessible probably not very performant

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,800
and this probably like you can think of

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,070
a hundred other ways that you could do

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,419
this so anyway I think you know where

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,950
I'm going with this the point of all

00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:40,930
these examples like get away from these

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,760
boring rectangles we're stuck in our old

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,490
ways we're stuck on the grid we could be

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,599
doing something a lot more exciting its

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,450
grids are great for all those reasons

00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:50,740
legibility readability balance but once

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,590
you understand the rules and you've

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,820
learned how and why they work you have

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,680
the foundations and you know why it's

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,940
like this then you can break the rules

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,039
and there comes a time when you want to

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,870
break out of your grid so wouldn't it be

00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:03,539
good if there was a way to do that well

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,400
there is there's one neat trick

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:09,400
CSS shapes so what the hell are CSS

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,680
shapes all about anyway well it's mainly

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,950
about this property and these are the

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,810
different values you can use for it so

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,360
shape outside applied to an element

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,770
makes text flow around that element in

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,930
the shape that you've chosen

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,000
hopefully the name is not too confusing

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,400
this sounds weird let's look at some

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,070
examples so we're just going to be

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,450
covering the top three values today I'm

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,950
the one with the microphone and I don't

00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:36,520
think inset is very interesting so let's

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:38,200
grab ellipsis I think they're just

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,430
basically the same as circles I told you

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,250
I wasn't a designer

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,400
so scrap that so let's start with the

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:48,400
circle I gotta warn you a lot of these

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,979
are real run seal CSS properties they

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,810
pretty much do what they say on the tin

00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:57,729
so hopefully it is unsurprising to you

00:06:52,810 --> 00:07:02,110
that shape outside circle aligns text

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:04,810
around a circle easy so this is a really

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,030
simple example assuming you wanted this

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,699
red dot layout you could do that however

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,560
you wanted I've done it like this and

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,800
then the only thing that you need to do

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,180
to add to get their text aligning around

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,530
the circle is to add this one property

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,880
it's super easy you don't need to add

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,300
any arguments to or anything it's just

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,039
there I think it's pretty neat if you

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,750
don't have shape outside support we'll

00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,680
talk more about this later as well then

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,240
no biggie

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,639
you just get your normal rectangular box

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,580
the alignment you haven't impacted your

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:38,979
readability or your accessibility so

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:40,960
that circles onto polygons so I thought

00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:43,479
the simplest example of a polygon is a

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,539
triangle this is what it might look like

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,250
and this is how you would make that

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:50,530
triangle shape for the text to flow

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,449
around so it's slightly more complicated

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,800
you have to actually like know the shape

00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:58,030
that you want to draw and figure out the

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,919
numbers and again this is a simple super

00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,360
simple example you can set up your

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,030
triangle however you want I've done it

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,260
like this and that's just the one liner

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,050
again that you need to add to get that

00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,990
really nice sharp line of text aligning

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,520
around your shape and just as with

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,169
circle if it's not supported then you

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,289
just fall back to your standard boxy

00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:19,780
grid no problem so this is another

00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,430
example of a polygon this is still

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,949
really simple it's just a square

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,270
rectangle with the corner cut off but

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,130
when you try and go and make that shape

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,159
you can see like this is looking a bit

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,240
crap these numbers are getting in my way

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,800
how do I keep them straight in my head

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,000
where do I start from like all these

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,089
kind of mmm

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,370
and it gets worse polygon could have

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:42,640
loads of points you could do something

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,800
really crazy like this and this these

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,970
points actually go on like probably out

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,870
the window is huge this declaration so

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,730
this is beginning to look like a bit of

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,650
a pain in the

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,050
and probably a bit of a barrier to entry

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,370
to using CSS shapes you have to think

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,140
about this stuff all the time then I'm

00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,850
probably not going to bother so we're

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,140
very lucky that gem Simmons and a bunch

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,670
of other people have been doing a bunch

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,480
of really good work to make this stuff

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:09,600
easier for us this is where the video

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:14,760
works hopefully so this is Firefox

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,560
nightly yes and it now has a CSS shaped

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,880
editor so I've loaded up my page I'm

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,810
just going to inspect the element that

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,610
has the shape on it and I don't know if

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,100
you can see down here but right next to

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,080
the declaration there's a little square

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,300
you click on it and then you get your

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,520
points in the browser just there and you

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,800
just dragging around and move things

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,310
about do every like this just blows my

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,040
 mind

00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,900
sorry French I think this is incredible

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,820
and the values are actually changing

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,110
here I don't if you can see that but

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,460
it's like dynamically updating

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,930
everything so when you've got it looking

00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,490
how you want or you and your designer

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,960
repairing at your computer and you've

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,180
got it how you want it you can just copy

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,600
that all over we don't have a round-trip

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:57,410
editing yet that's the next talk so I

00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,120
think that's like this is amazing yeah

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,430
it's in Firefox nightly it's not like

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,890
primetime yeah you have to go into the

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,920
config and enable some properties I

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,390
think the top two and I found this again

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,070
yeah by following Jen Simmons on Twitter

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,600
she is amazing she's done a video that

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,460
explains a whole lot more stuff about

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,110
these tools and what else is available

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,360
it's not just CSS shapes I recommend you

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,850
go and have a look at that

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,380
however if getting Firefox nightly and

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,750
turning on the config is too much effort

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,570
for you there is also a similar tool in

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,220
Chrome this is an extension that you can

00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:35,040
add to the browser and it does kind of

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:38,940
similar stuff yeah so that's all about

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,950
polygons and even with these tools you

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,470
might find that like I still don't

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,510
paying out I got dragged around God so

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,340
there's one last value for the shape

00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,950
outside property that I want to tell you

00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,230
about today and that is shape outside

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,600
URL now if you thought that editing

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,940
tools in the browser was magic I just

00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,100
this is like a black art this really

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,960
blows my mind actually magic or as near

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,770
to it as browser development has got for

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,580
me

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:09,270
so shape outside URL takes an image

00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,680
parameter and it knows the browser knows

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,410
where the transparent spots of the

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,540
images are so when you add this property

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,510
this just happens automatically by magic

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,370
for you there's a couple of extra bits

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,630
there that are added in so shape outside

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,220
is like this is the image that you're

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:27,930
going to wrap the text around the image

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,070
threshold is how much of the pixel is

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,320
transparent before it's kind of

00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,730
recognized as the alignment and then

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,020
there's new shape margin property is

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,460
just to get that gap so that things

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,940
don't kind of bump up right up against

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,590
each other so yeah like I found this out

00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,150
and just completely blew my mind again I

00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,430
think this is amazing and I think it's a

00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,590
much better use case for shape outside

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,030
because I think if you do it if you want

00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,650
to do this kind of work then it's

00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,390
probably more likely that you will be

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,700
aligning text around an image rather

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,830
than around like a random triangle like

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,060
I've been doing in my examples so if

00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,320
you've gone to the effort of making this

00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,430
transparent image and the designers

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,660
happy with it and everything like that

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,770
then you may as well just chuck it in

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,490
there and kind of let the browser do the

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:09,170
work for you

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:11,310
brilliant so that's shape outside

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,870
there's one other property which I would

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:16,650
like to talk to you about to shape

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:18,450
inside I whoa I think of it as the it's

00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,800
not ready yet unfortunately this is like

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:23,100
a preview of five years down the line

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,230
probably I think of it as the opposite

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,330
of shape inside but it would allow us to

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,950
do like RT things like this where the

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,790
text will go inside the shape rather

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:34,290
than outside it's kind of a weird one it

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,960
was actually implemented in a couple of

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,010
browsers a while back and then it turned

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,290
out to be a little bit more complicated

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,710
and then it seemed at first I think so

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,480
they quickly ripped it back out again

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:50,940
yeah I'm not sure when this is gonna

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:53,160
turn up unfortunately so that's CSS

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,600
shapes a couple of things to remember if

00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,210
you do want to take up this away and go

00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:03,510
back to your homes and offices and start

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:05,240
using it browser support great that

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,960
video that I showed you with the

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,880
gentleman's talking about the editor

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,990
tools she said that this is going to be

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,750
available and those tools will be

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,120
available in Firefox 59 so I guess

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,019
that's good it's like on its way and I

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,829
think it has a real

00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:23,929
a priority of medium for edge so no idea

00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:27,119
what that means you know not terrible

00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:29,279
and the nice thing about it as Jen said

00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:30,749
is no biggie if it doesn't work then you

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,920
just fall back to your normal grid it's

00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:35,100
like an extra progressive enhancement

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,759
thing that you add on at the end or the

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:42,720
beginning so the other thing to remember

00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,339
if you want to use CSS shape is thinking

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,309
about how you deal with responsiveness

00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,110
so that polygon argument will take I was

00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:50,579
showing you pixels but it does use REMS

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,949
it can you can use percentages you can

00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,139
use whatever you like in there you could

00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:59,339
have 100% image and reshape it however

00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:02,670
you like one thing that probably is

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,110
worth mentioning is this is a redesign

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,699
of stuff and nonsense website which I

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,549
found very recently I think it's quite

00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:10,920
new and you'll see that there examples

00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:13,589
all have a flush right edge on the text

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,959
and the ragged edge is on the left hand

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:17,910
side and that's really important to keep

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,199
that readability that we don't want to

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,929
lose from having our grid layouts

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,279
because reading from the ref right edge

00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,389
of reggae text is really difficult you

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,249
can't find your way back to where you

00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:27,929
started from so if you're doing stuff in

00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:29,459
a right to left language you probably

00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:37,799
want to be doing all of your images on

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:39,329
this side yeah so use it or lose it I

00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,529
think with these kind of properties when

00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:42,809
they're brand new like this it's really

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:44,519
up to us as developers to implement them

00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:46,139
and to try and experiment and use them

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,639
otherwise they will just get taken away

00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:51,990
again if we don't play nicely with our

00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:55,799
toys so yeah I think go forth experiment

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,480
through some CSS shapes and if you do

00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,579
then share them with me I'm really

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,459
excited to see what you are all inspired

00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:05,240
to make and tell me how you get on I

00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,240
think that's it

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,350
