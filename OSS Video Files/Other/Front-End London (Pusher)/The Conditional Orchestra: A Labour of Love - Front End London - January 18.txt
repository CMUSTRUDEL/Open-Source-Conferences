Title: The Conditional Orchestra: A Labour of Love - Front End London - January 18
Publication date: 2018-02-10
Playlist: Front-End London
Description: 
	Richard Bultitude

The Conditional Orchestra is a web app that converts weather data into music â€” a personal project Richard has been developing for almost two years. In this talk he reveals the creative inspiration behind the idea and the technical challenges that kept him up at night. He'll explain how some of the most rewarding experiences on this journey were unplanned, for example, writing a JS module for generating musical scales and contributing to an open-source API wrapper

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,180
so I'm here to talk to you about the

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:09,059
conditional orchestra which is a

00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,000
personal project of mine that took

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:15,109
almost two years to make because I did

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,600
it in my spare time evenings weekends

00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:20,580
the occasional holiday day taken to work

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,580
on it so I want to thank my wife for

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,730
being incredibly patient during this

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,039
time this is probably the last personal

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,009
project I'll do for a few years she can

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,880
be reassured and what it is is it's a

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:41,059
web app that converts weather data to

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:44,489
music I will explain more shortly so

00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:45,930
just a tiny bit about me first as I'm

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,960
you said my name is Richard ball titude

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,110
unusual surname perhaps my main

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,410
interests are art and technology

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,449
amongst other things and this project is

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,109
very much about bringing those two

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:05,400
worlds together I recently started a new

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,350
job safety and sapient Razorfish who if

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,770
you've not heard of them are like a

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,700
multi you know yeah global consultancy

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,880
slash agency so yeah I only been there

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,900
three weeks and I can't tell you too

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,259
much about them I'm not going to

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,570
oversell them but yeah I'm enjoying it

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,659
so far it's a good place I'm also a

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,390
musician in my spare time I've put out a

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,540
few records over the years the one in

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,840
the top left it's my first record back

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,759
in 2004 and most of my music came out

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,070
into the name of point B but I've also

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,560
recorded as planes and front the latter

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,869
which is probably the project which most

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,610
closely matches what the conditional

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,189
orchestra sounds like which we will hear

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:55,439
later so yeah on to the actual project

00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:58,860
itself so as I say it's a web app that

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,369
converts weather data into music and the

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,390
question that's maybe begging is why on

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,390
earth did I come up with that idea

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,869
so quite a while ago

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,670
I came across this I haven't actually

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,099
been there but this is the Daraa and

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,249
Croatia maybe some of you

00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,709
in here know this and have been there in

00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:22,950
which case you're very lucky so it's a

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:26,760
piece of I guess public coastal

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:31,260
architecture the uses the movement of

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,810
waves to make music so the the waves lap

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,819
against the shore which is the piece of

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,459
architecture and they force air through

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,919
a series of chambers and that produces a

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,830
sound and I find this really really

00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,539
inspiring so that's a little listen I

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,539
[Music]

00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:59,139
[Music]

00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,829
mean I find it really really charming

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,840
and beguiling but a friend of mine did

00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:12,930
say it sounded like someone playing like

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,780
the pan flute really badly so it's a

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,509
it's a matter of taste but I really

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,299
really liked the idea that you know one

00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:23,579
one force one natural force was being

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,439
converted into something else

00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,019
and I kind of like the fact that the

00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,870
sound that you hear is is an analog of

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,389
the waves themselves and so I really

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,720
loved that project and that kind of set

00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:38,810
some initial thoughts going and around

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,530
that time I was starting to explore

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:46,979
generative music which is essentially

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:49,409
music whereby you create a system that

00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:52,709
generates music rather than actually

00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:56,790
writing it as score or programming and

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:58,889
sequencing it and I wrote a blog series

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,840
on on how to do it using this particular

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:04,229
piece of software called Reason which is

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,949
a music editor and I was really enjoying

00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:10,609
the idea of kind of creating sounds that

00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:13,680
I couldn't really normally imagine by

00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:17,099
you know using randomness and and sort

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,349
of allowing the system to have some

00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:24,210
freedom in it but the actual sources

00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,860
were essentially just oscillators

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,200
they're things that produce numbers

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,930
underneath and

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,820
I sort of didn't like the fact that oh I

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,470
didn't really feel like pursuing that

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,250
because it wasn't connected to the

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:40,850
outside world in any way so going back

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,110
to what I said about the C organ I kind

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,510
of start to think about how I could

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,330
somehow incorporate forces of nature or

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:51,380
the weather into some kind of generative

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,790
music system you know the weather's

00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,880
going to be a bit of a winner in that

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:59,000
respect right because well it's

00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,770
something we all experience and it's

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,080
always changing so it's a it's a really

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,140
good data source in that respect if you

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,580
want to make crazy music so I had to

00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,720
kind of think about how is actually

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,580
going to go about it and I don't mean

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,350
from a technical perspective but what am

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,860
I actually gonna what two things am I

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:18,140
going to join and over the last five

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,230
years I've gone to resonate Festival

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,520
conference lush festival in Belgrade

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:26,300
which if you don't know it I'd really

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,310
recommend it's a really inspiring event

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,800
about digital culture lots of

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,710
fascinating speakers some of them kind

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,920
of do some of them are artists some of

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,860
them

00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,090
lecturers some of them are technicians

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,580
but there's a guy that spoke they're

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:43,100
called James bridle who's a really

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,660
interesting character and he had this

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,150
project called a ship adrift it's

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,310
probably one of the more simple and

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,290
slightly sort of superficial projects

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:55,130
that he's done but something about it

00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,420
really really charmed me so just you

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,170
have that picture what makes sense yet

00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:03,830
does anyone recognize this so this is on

00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:06,920
the south bank this is a hotel room that

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,290
you can actually rent so I think you can

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,900
still rent it but yeah it's a boat on

00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,160
the south bank Center and you'll notice

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,670
at this point when this picture was

00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,730
taken that it's got essentially a kind

00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:23,090
of simple weather station on the roof so

00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:25,430
James bridle decided to use this to do

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:29,630
something interesting with it so he took

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:33,770
the wind speed and the wind bearing or

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:36,650
direction and he plotted what this ship

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:41,060
would do if it were to sail across the

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:44,030
world which now I should explain the map

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:48,200
so it's really sweet this thing set sail

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,030
over you know a year 365 days and it

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,150
made its way all the way down to

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,680
Australia and you know he he formed a

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,720
real emotional attachment to it you know

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,540
he watched this thing move slowly but

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,990
surely every day and actually liked the

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,570
idea that you know you had to simple

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,360
data inputs and you could do something

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,460
extraordinary with them so I said okay

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,150
this is my this is my starting point now

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,400
so I'm gonna take wind speed and map

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,440
that to the volume of a sound and I'm

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,320
gonna take the bearing and map that to

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,240
the pitch and initially I just you know

00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,169
those ranges I just you know I just

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,310
settled on something just to get myself

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:32,210
started and there wasn't a lot of

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:34,970
creative process to this but yeah it

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,490
took me to an interesting place so my

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,380
prototype for the conditional Orchestra

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,290
was a little project I called the

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:45,490
musical weather vane and it was

00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:47,990
completely static it got live data but

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,150
you know that the three points which is

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,080
static I just thought okay can i play a

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:56,210
chord using the wind beragon and speed

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,310
from three different locations so I

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,680
hooked it up to whatever it says here

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,600
Montevideo in Uruguay in Tokyo and Cape

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,600
Town and it produced this

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:19,709
[Music]

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:28,879
which depending what you're into it's

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,110
either really good or you know or kind

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,789
of slightly dissonant and unpleasant um

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,830
but it was interesting starting point

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,919
you know I had I had some I had some

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,779
data and I had some sounds and so I was

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,729
kind of starting to think about okay I

00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,589
started to see in my mind that I had to

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,940
design something pretty sophisticated to

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:51,320
play music that you know there is more

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,700
either describe to the weather better or

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,110
is actually just more aesthetically

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,820
pleasing but it was a start so just a

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,040
slight detour just gonna explain quickly

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,220
how I got that working and what I've

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,660
used to make the conditional Orchestra

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,510
so well actually let me skip ahead

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,149
slightly so there's some creative coding

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,730
framework called processing and which is

00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:15,290
a Java based framework and it's been

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,410
going for 12 years now I think

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,610
and I've done a few courses on it in

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,640
things and it's a really powerful tool

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,740
you can do 3d and you can kind of marry

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,550
audio and visual visual and you can you

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,020
can do some really exciting

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,290
extraordinary things with it but it's

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:34,100
based on a very simple premise you could

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,779
previously publish to canvas it would

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,089
write JavaScript for you from the Java

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:39,709
it would pass it all but it was pretty

00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,990
awful it wasn't really what it was built

00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:45,829
for so a very lovely person called

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:48,980
Lauren McCarthy and took the immense

00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:52,279
time and trouble to port it properly to

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,959
JavaScript and called it p5 by the way

00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,190
if anyone gets to see Lauren McCarthy

00:09:53,959 --> 00:10:00,829
speak I would really recommend it she's

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:03,170
really really inspiring an interesting

00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:05,449
person her she's a she's technical but

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,620
she's um she's done a lot of really

00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:10,160
really interesting and really funny

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,480
slightly black Mira esque projects so

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,480
yeah check out her work she's she's

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:18,699
awesome and so just quickly explain the

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,560
very bare-bones of processing or p5 so

00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:23,480
three sort of fundamental methods

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,720
firstly have pre load which kind of

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,180
speaks for itself I'm gonna load a sound

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,520
one of them are you just heard and when

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,380
that is ready it's going to move to the

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,760
setup which is where I get to set things

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,230
like frame rate

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,150
and now we're gonna answer a draw loop

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,610
and that's just gonna loop forever until

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:45,410
I stop it and what's nice is this lends

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:49,340
itself very easily 200 style programming

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:53,510
excuse the es5 folks but you know I

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:56,600
wrote this a little while ago weird

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:59,660
things have to apologize for right so

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,390
this constructor is one node in my

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,800
spiral so it's got some properties and

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,540
some stuff that's been set from the

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,220
beginning and then I have these two

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,670
really important methods that I've added

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,130
to it paint an update and paint is gonna

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,380
draw something on my canvas an update is

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,570
where I can write my algorithms and and

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:22,540
so on and and actually make stuff move

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:25,070
around so yeah that's that's my object

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,460
and then if we go back to the set up and

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:30,200
draw in my setup I create my canvas I

00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,110
attach it to something I set a

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,210
background color I make my array of you

00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,340
know my array for my spiral out of all

00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,410
those nodes I just showed you and then I

00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,140
can just loop through them all in the

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,390
draw and I paint onto the canvas and I

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,420
update and they move so that's that's

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,800
the basic premise this is pretty much

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,110
the product of that code it's way to

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,960
quickly show you how easy it is to to

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:56,300
think and work in that way so yeah I've

00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,270
got a few of these on github which you

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:03,770
can check out if you're interested so I

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:07,520
had the musical weathervane and I needed

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:09,500
to take that idea further I didn't I

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,960
really didn't want it to be a passive

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,170
thing I wanted you know whatever it was

00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,210
going to be had to it had to have the

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,220
user as an important part of it right I

00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,620
don't you just listening to a bunch of

00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,550
places that I've picked so I suppose the

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:28,370
obvious next step miss perhaps fairly

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:31,750
fairly obvious so I kind of need to

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,680
think about the main call to action so I

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,570
thought to myself okay well let's just

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,860
keep it really really simple let's just

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:42,500
ask people play my weather so it's gonna

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,200
look up your location should you allow

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,080
it if you don't you can have to find

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,899
some other way to play the music

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,870
and it will go and fetch the weather

00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:56,100
data and it will map all of those data

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:59,080
points to different facets to music and

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,810
it will play you something that evokes

00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,100
the weather that was the idea so I

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,779
thought that was good enough to begin

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,610
with and I kind of started to shape that

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,230
and I did a lot of hacking I didn't I

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,870
made the classic mistake I'm not really

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,730
planning the application properly from

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,850
the beginning and hacking to get it work

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:19,000
out of excitement and I probably spent a

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:22,839
year and doing lots of that hacking but

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,399
I had fun sort of mmm and then I thought

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,690
okay you know they give the people what

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,160
they want right they're gonna want to

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,750
put their own location and think I want

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,420
to be able to listen to the music of the

00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:34,029
world so I added a simple form which

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,399
does reverse geocoding thanks to Google

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,760
and you know you can put anywhere you

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:44,079
want in there so tiny bit about the data

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:47,740
points that I used so initially I just

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,870
mapped each of these available points to

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,959
one particular aspect of the music and

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,130
then I very quickly run out of ways to

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,790
actually make the music sophisticated

00:13:54,130 --> 00:14:00,790
enough so I had to use combinations of

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:04,000
these to infer new weather conditions so

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,579
for example fog you know that's if I

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,200
remember correctly the difference or

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:12,850
it's when there's less than four degrees

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:17,020
between humidity and the humidity point

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,750
the dew point and the temperature and I

00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:23,620
can from that or if I haven't got that

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:25,959
from the visibility that day I can kind

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,810
of infer that it's foggy or or you know

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,699
or misty so you know I would create

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,949
something like that out of these and

00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:34,480
then I would assign that to another

00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:36,430
aspect of the music and I just do that

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,860
over and over again until I was happy

00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:41,560
with the music which took enormous

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,880
amount of time and a lot of testing but

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,600
it was worth it because the music had to

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,149
be had to be good so yeah a really

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,690
obvious example of a direct mapping

00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:54,699
would be you know that I used pressure

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,740
to determine what the root note is so

00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:59,100
that lower the pressure that lower that

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,800
whole thing plays in and the high

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:06,450
pressure the higher the whole thing

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:09,560
plays in and the service that I used to

00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:12,930
get the weather data is dark sky

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,970
formally forecast I are very kindly they

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:17,280
completely rebranded during me making

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,590
this so you know a few things needed to

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,420
be updated and they added some new data

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:24,300
points and they changed a few bits and

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:28,800
bobs but it was all good

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:32,250
so on their site it was a list of the

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,930
official JavaScript wrappers or sorry

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:37,140
wrappers in any language and there was

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:39,630
one listed for JavaScript which I began

00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,640
to use and I kind of got talking to the

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,950
guy that wrote it and though I'm still

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,720
really grateful to because he he got me

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,480
going on this but he admitted himself

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,200
that he wasn't a hardcore developer and

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,500
it probably had a few possible

00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,700
enhancements being diplomatic what are

00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,670
the things that was up with it was that

00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:02,190
the when it was handling a request and I

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,020
can only handle one at a time it

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,680
completely blocked the main thread it

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:09,540
was it wasn't asynchronous so I rewrote

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,090
a lot of it I made it promise based and

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:16,380
you know you can use as many points as

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:18,660
you want and yeah I fixed a fix a few

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,180
things up and he let me be a core

00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:24,240
contributor and it was my first proper

00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,580
foray into actually contributing to

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,690
something meaningful out there and that

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,340
was really nice even though it's a

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,480
tangent and I was like Africa sake I

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,980
just want to make the damn project

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,080
actually it was really important for me

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,530
to give something back and and yeah you

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,050
know he I think he really appreciated

00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:46,350
someone giving the library attention um

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:48,450
since then I have actually written some

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,340
code which breaks the original so I've

00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,560
published my own version of it he was

00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,510
cool about it I kind of felt like it

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,650
needed to be done there was variable

00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,120
names and function names that didn't

00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,770
match so you couldn't loop through them

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,040
without going too much detail I

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:03,600
published my own it's on NPM it did

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,100
pretty well it got quite a few downloads

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,340
and got some good feedback no issues so

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,230
far but then I'm promoting it now so you

00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:16,070
know hopefully one of you guys will find

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,820
something I can fix it that would be fun

00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:20,280
but like yeah it was an interesting

00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,020
lesson in this and couple of the people

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,610
have mentioned this up front in London

00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,840
that if you're going to publish

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,720
something like this make the

00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:31,020
documentation really good and write unit

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,970
tests those are my two tips I think from

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,460
that because the documentation is thrown

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:39,660
because I know that it's you know fairly

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:42,930
robust I've not had many issues and it's

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,220
all been good mm-hmm so I thought okay

00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,750
cool I can just carry on with making the

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,520
music now this is gonna be great

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,370
just gonna yeah it's going to make some

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,590
music using Web Audio and then I was

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,080
like ah actually hang on hang on hang on

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,510
what I want to do isn't quite what lots

00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,550
of other people are doing so the way Web

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,200
Audio works is that you can create an

00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,270
oscillator so that's just something

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,460
that's gonna produce a wave of some kind

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,490
of sine wave a sawtooth wave it's gonna

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,910
make a noise and you can essentially

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,260
pump into it a number and that number

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,000
corresponds to a real frequency in Hertz

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,450
so 440

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,070
would be the note a brilliant but why I

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,130
wanted to do is I wanted to use audio

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:25,470
files of my own you know musician as

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,580
well and I wanted to use texture and I

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,900
wanted to make the music more

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,220
interesting basically oscillators are

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:37,170
quite simple I suppose so the way that

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:39,840
works is that one the frequency one is

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,450
the root note of that if that file is

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,580
playing so to go an octave higher you

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,380
have to double it to go an octave lower

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,180
you have to have it and now you're

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,350
started you know maybe you can see where

00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,170
I'm going this but you start to gain to

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,370
some slightly heavier maths and there

00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,160
weren't libraries out there that really

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:58,290
did what I was looking for I just waited

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,980
to be able to pitch an audio file up and

00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:06,500
down to the right note that I wanted so

00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,700
I went off on another another tangent

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:12,080
which was probably about five months or

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:17,490
something writing my own

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:20,190
audio engine which was another amazing

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:23,760
adventure um had to learn a lot more

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,260
about music theory than I expected

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,840
the first thing I encountered was

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,700
actually there's two systems for the way

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,740
music actually works there's one in

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:37,380
nature which is let me think what's it

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:40,010
called equal temperament I think anyone

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,060
will help me out with this and basically

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,850
the two different systems work slightly

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:49,860
differently in nature the this that

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:52,470
what's that yeah it's ratios right yeah

00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:55,470
so one system is ratios and that's

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:58,260
pretty heavy stuff to write yourself and

00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,480
also the notes that are actually

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,740
produced and nature of slightly

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,530
discordant people actually aren't use

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:08,400
them anymore nearly all music is written

00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:10,050
in a new system a tempered system that's

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,510
how I kind of keyboard works that it's

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,850
divided up so there's a formula for that

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,590
and the formula is reasonably

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,650
straightforward but I basically use that

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:22,050
as the basis for the for the kind of

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,820
audio engine that I needed to write and

00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,080
actually as with all these things you

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,400
write something yourself and you've got

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,950
a really clear idea what problems it

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,700
solves you can make it do stuff that

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:35,340
other peoples can't so I called it

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:40,440
freaky as well.she off of that name was

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:43,410
available and I built in some features

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,690
that yeah that I'm quite proud of so

00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,040
yeah you can create as many notes as you

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:50,520
want it basically gives you an array of

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,660
frequencies you can kind of offset it so

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,640
if you're making lots and lots of

00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,110
different chords and scales and things

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,820
you can kind of keep offsetting it and

00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,280
changing the route no and it's really

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,730
flexible in lots of ways and so just a

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,620
quick look at the API so there's one

00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:07,260
method really that you would use and

00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,120
it's going to get you this array that

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,400
you can play with and there's two

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,870
Monetary arguments so the actual start

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,330
frequency which if you remember from the

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,750
other slide it could be a frequency in

00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:23,240
Hertz or it could be at the number you

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:25,429
know the relative frequency and the

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,440
yeah the stuff that you want you know

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:29,740
what notes do you want but I want to you

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:35,150
know I want note zero note 3 and node 5

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:36,860
so a minor scale is it major yeah of

00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,809
course it is yeah thank you

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:43,910
I know I'm talking about now honestly

00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:48,650
and there's a load of optional arguments

00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:50,210
while solos 3 number of semitones which

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,179
is which is the most interesting one for

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:56,960
me because in a normal in normal western

00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:59,210
music there's 12 notes in an octave but

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,040
with this you can say how many you want

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,809
so it would divide an octave up into as

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,320
many notes as you like which means you

00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:08,420
can make crazy music basically really

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,360
far out is it or you can make music more

00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:14,750
easily that some that is closer to

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,010
things like the Indian scales but it

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,550
gives you that flexibility you can just

00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:22,670
decide how you divide up frequencies

00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:25,840
basically which I thought was useful and

00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:28,490
I actually did using this application so

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,309
going back to actually what I was making

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,340
I had something that kind of worked and

00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:36,200
now I was starting to get happy with but

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,880
the most important thing to do at this

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,440
point before you go any further right

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:44,210
kids is to ask for feedback because yeah

00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,420
you don't know if what you've made is

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,820
actually awful always just got you know

00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,140
some enhancements that are going to make

00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,700
the experience better that's how I

00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:58,130
should have expressed it originally so

00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:00,440
yeah really interesting point in the

00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,880
processes for me because I just thought

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,809
okay you've got two buttons you can do

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,950
what you want you can listen to this

00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:06,710
music you listen to your weather

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,300
that's pretty cool isn't it and people

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,130
like yeah that's cool book how the hell

00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,020
does it work like one friend of mine

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,450
even said to me do I even know that

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,620
you're really doing it I was like what

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,360
do you think it's doing he's like well

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,360
you know it's just playing backup track

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,740
that you've written how cynical is that

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,690
that's terrible

00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,140
and of course it's bloody real took me a

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:30,230
year to get to this point and anyway

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,000
yeah so that the feedback was how do we

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,370
kind of see inside this how do we

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,540
understand what you know what facets of

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,929
the weather are being mapped to what

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,419
sound

00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:41,039
and actually having slept on it I was

00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,990
like that's that's actually a good point

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,570
right you want to see what's going on

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:50,640
fair enough okay I'll set aside another

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:52,980
two or three months and yeah what I

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,990
realized I was about to do was something

00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,850
really strange in our world right

00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,649
normally you wouldn't want to expose

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,409
what an application is doing underneath

00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:03,659
you know really like normally people

00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:05,460
want content or they want to perform an

00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,669
action you know right they want to

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:11,220
complete a task whereas yeah I needed to

00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:14,010
kind of show people that I guess the

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,260
inner workings are the content so I

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,799
designed a simple sort of card system

00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:22,139
where you can clearly see what the

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,059
condition is that amusing and I had to

00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:27,720
sort of friend friendly if I some of

00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:30,779
these do some tax protesting what it's

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,190
what it's doing to the music and yeah

00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:34,200
they give you a nice icon I mean I give

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,149
some values here and there and for

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,519
billions I just leave it out altogether

00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:40,830
I just admit it

00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,149
and I used handlebars to do this and

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:47,669
like kind of yeah I didn't I didn't make

00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:50,669
it too fussy but I just had a yeah a way

00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:53,460
of kind of mapping that data that that

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:55,350
made sense for both the music and the

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,090
visual but I had to do a lot of and

00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,409
picking a lot of refactoring to get to

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,510
this because the way I've written

00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:02,490
everything was just to work with the

00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:06,779
music so I now had to kind of make it

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:09,720
agnostic to that so add another month

00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:11,460
and and I was at a place where I could

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,320
start testing it myself a bit more so I

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,330
used this service which you may have

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,460
come across which is awesome called it's

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,860
now called windy TVs formerly windy

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:25,409
sorry it's now windy calm it's formerly

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:28,230
windy TV and it's a live map of the

00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:30,029
world with all the wind patterns and

00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,039
rain patterns and pressure and whatnot

00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,720
and gives you a real-time view of the

00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:36,870
weather excuse me because what I

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,630
realized was that that if you use static

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,190
data maybe you've all encountered this

00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,929
too sometimes when you use static data

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:46,710
for something that is actually real in

00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:49,450
the world that static data when you

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,460
amend it yourself generates values

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,440
that aren't actually realistic you know

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,870
I mean you can't have rain when it's

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,820
sunny you get the idea right so I

00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,519
actually had to use I actually had to

00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,200
use real real weather data to test it so

00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,700
I had to test the extremities of I had

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,100
to test what what happens when there's a

00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,409
hurricane what happens when it's minus

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:12,100
40 in howling with wind and that kind of

00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:14,169
actually allowed me to - yeah to give it

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,860
more a bit more breath and to bring it

00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:20,019
to life a bit more so what do you do

00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,149
after that well you test again because

00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:23,769
I'd only asked a few people and they've

00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:25,480
given me some good steers but now I

00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:27,549
really wanted to know you know how it

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:32,230
works on different devices and what it's

00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:34,630
like for people that are not poring over

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:37,299
it like I was so I asked about 20 people

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,159
to give me some feedback into my days

00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:41,649
and at this point it was largely really

00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:44,669
positive but again it's amazing how many

00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:47,649
good ideas come out of you know people

00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:51,370
that aren't yourself experiencing

00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:54,789
something so hmm yeah the first thing I

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:58,870
did was listen to people making the case

00:26:54,789 --> 00:27:00,730
that even with the kind of cards which

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,100
explain how it works it still wasn't

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,289
visual enough you know it so I added

00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,130
some theming so it changes color when

00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:10,149
the weather conditions are different and

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,750
Google satellite view so you can

00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:16,450
actually see where you are and you know

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,220
little things like just you know can the

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,450
forum handle bad characters which I kind

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,570
of missed you know I'm always putting

00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:24,460
nice friendly you know well-written

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,019
place names in but you know what happens

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,899
if you put an app in or something always

00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:30,909
people to be able to share it so now

00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:33,490
when it loads a particular place

00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:35,529
actually gives you a hash URL so you

00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,720
could share it with your mates listen to

00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,350
the listen to the sound of Trump so if

00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,200
that makes sense

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,269
listen to the sound of London listen to

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,440
the weather of London so you know my

00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:46,690
first few tweets about it when I

00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,559
launched it were you know links to

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:52,419
things that were happening in real time

00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:54,890
tiny a little bit about the tech and

00:27:52,419 --> 00:28:00,390
then we can actually listen to it

00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:02,070
so at this time I threw those two tools

00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,050
in and I know they're not cool anymore

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,790
well actually go probably gets a bit of

00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,620
a hard time but it's actually still

00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,940
really awesome but yeah I probably would

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,830
have just put where back in because I

00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,970
needed some I could have done with some

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:18,450
nice ways of handling the bundles I use

00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,190
postal I kind of wish I had used some

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,200
kind of store manager now because I've

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,140
got loads of objects lots of stuff

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,480
happening over time and I need a good

00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,880
way of managing that so yeah I was

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,580
basically just using pub/sub which is

00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,560
it's okay but it's kind of borderline

00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,660
borderline any more complexity and it

00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,130
would be really nasty and these are the

00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,990
only two external services I was using

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,790
really that's pretty much it I mean

00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,950
everything else is all all the stuff I

00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,570
wrote myself so I was quite pleased that

00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,130
I'd kept all the dependencies down to a

00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,640
minimum and I'm gonna see these two just

00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:54,720
build tools so I just quickly explain to

00:28:50,640 --> 00:29:00,930
you the application logic this is why I

00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:04,290
should have started with folks so first

00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:06,840
thing to ask is is there web audio

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:09,660
because you're not going to enjoy this

00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,300
if your browser doesn't support it right

00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,100
it's game over so I'm gonna show an

00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,800
error if you haven't got that thankfully

00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,160
most browsers do it so I'm going to show

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,530
a ready state at this point and then

00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:24,600
three things could happen I could have

00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:26,310
actually put a URL in like you saw in

00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,350
the tweet and that would start the whole

00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:31,650
thing off you could enter a place

00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:34,080
yourself which we'll do in a minute or

00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,670
you can just press by my weather and

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,370
then what we do is we check whether

00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,710
you're actually still online or not

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:43,800
which would be a weird thing to do in an

00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,570
application at that point if all user

00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,430
experiences we're linear like that but

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,630
obviously you know anything could have

00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,700
happened you know or you might come back

00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:53,700
to it you might be on a train you know

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:57,150
we all understand the merits of managing

00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:59,820
that situation right so basically let's

00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:01,590
assume that you are then it can actually

00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,990
start doing its work and it can get the

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:07,170
location or reverse geocode get the

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,020
satellite image and then put some data

00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,340
in the local store

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,870
which is obviously really important

00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:15,490
because that's what we're going to use

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:18,160
if you are offline and yeah there's the

00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,890
logic for using the local storage and if

00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,990
that fails then there is some static

00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,840
data so if you go offline and you

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:28,020
haven't already loaded a location I've

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:32,620
got some music for you anyway

00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:36,280
from from London 2016 and whenever it

00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:39,120
was I captured it and then yeah we just

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:41,650
configured the sounds and interestingly

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,500
what interesting me for me I used a web

00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:47,110
worker the first time because loading

00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,740
all those cards the cars that explained

00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,280
how it works

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,770
and we're taking up precious performance

00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,380
I need for the Web Audio which is you

00:30:53,770 --> 00:31:01,080
know which is not always that performant

00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:03,309
on on you know slower devices so I

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,410
basically let the web worker handle that

00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:07,720
and when that's finished sorting out all

00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,309
the visuals for me I load them into the

00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:14,350
application and we actually hear some

00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:17,200
music so we should probably listen to

00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:21,880
something right yeah

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:38,040
so before I take any requests I'm just

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:38,040
gonna play the weather of here now okay

00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:43,289
[Music]

00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,099
[Music]

00:31:53,470 --> 00:32:02,880
so this for a little while to make it

00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:13,020
that spelled correctly they don't happy

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,020
they're wise I need to be shot right

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,340
it's raining twinkles that means it's

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:49,119
raining

00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:49,119
[Music]

00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:58,550
so a couple of little points I just

00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:59,720
wanted to finish with so yeah I haven't

00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,550
done any work on it for a couple of

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,740
months because I needed a break

00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:07,300
but I have still got some some plans for

00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:10,070
it what I'd like to do if I somehow

00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,800
negotiate a sabbatical from from work is

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:15,890
to actually hook it up to a real weather

00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,580
station and and have it play the music

00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:22,100
or generate the music in real time and

00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:25,160
yeah and I kind of want to hook up with

00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:27,050
some arts organisations or you know

00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,750
museums or venues that might put it on

00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:31,430
there was a place in Netherlands I had

00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,660
an IEEE exhibition where they they

00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,520
hosted it along with those of other

00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,350
experimental music technology that you

00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:39,260
could play with so that was really nice

00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,820
got lots of good feedback about that so

00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,750
yeah I kind of want it to tour a little

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:46,700
bit and yeah obviously you know if

00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,550
anyone has got any suggestions or wants

00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:53,120
to fork it or talk to me about some kind

00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:55,280
of strange collaboration then you know

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,770
I'd love to love to hear about it

00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,880
so yeah that's it for me thank you very

00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:05,529
much for listening

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:05,529
