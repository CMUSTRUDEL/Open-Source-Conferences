Playlist: Front-End London
Description: 
	There are limits on our ability to learn and process information. Overloading ourselves with information can impact productivity by causing psychological and physiological stress. In this talk, Jo Pearce relates some findings from the world of cognitive psychology that can help us understand how, as developers, we might be overloading ourselves.

This talk was part of the Front-end London (fel) April 2016 event.
