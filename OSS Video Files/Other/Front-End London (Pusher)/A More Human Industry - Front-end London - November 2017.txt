a friend of mine Dan who's actually in

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,890
the room hi dad once had a go at me

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,889
saying Jess every single talk you've

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,750
ever given is a very very happy voice

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,940
talk about how everything in technology

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:20,010
is terrible

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,320
so please enjoy some spoilers so my name

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,789
is Jessica rose I'm originally you may

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,430
be able to tell from the state's a long

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,519
time ago and I'm working at futurelearn

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,289
now it's fantastic if you're a front-end

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,859
developer and you love developing for

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,059
the front-end

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,800
I hear that made by many may be hiring

00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:39,899
if you want to do sort of some op C

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,790
stuff instead and you want to learn new

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,420
things around that maybe come and chat

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,469
to me afterwards see me after class and

00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,570
the first thing I want to talk to you

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,390
about is what's fantastic about working

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,489
in technology working in technology has

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,789
a lot of things especially when you look

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,550
at other industries that are glorious

00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:01,670
the average software engineer makes

00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,670
$70,000 a year

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:07,530
that figures garbage that figure is

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,720
absolutely unhelpful this the average

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,560
software engineer makes $70,000 a year

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,720
has nothing to do with our experience

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,030
hey if I'm in San Francisco and I'm

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,520
giving this talk this is fine this is

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,619
not San Francisco I want to talk to you

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,830
about what's great about working in

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,840
technology here in London here in London

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,689
the average software engineer makes

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,579
about 43,000 pounds

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:38,119
do we feel okay with that anybody want

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:42,329
to read some out raised eyebrows Oh see

00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:44,640
this isn't fantastic for everybody not

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,159
all of us have our own sports cars but

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,759
this is 10,000 pounds higher than the

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,799
average salary here in London it's the

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,899
last question right before we broke was

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,540
saying do you know what there are so

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,000
many developer rules unfilled one in

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,299
four tech roles here in London are going

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,130
to go unfilled this year the official

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,439
national unemployment rate is four point

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,780
three percent but for young people which

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,020
we've got a bunch in the crowd it's 11

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,500
almost 12 percent relative to other

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,950
industries

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,030
we're incredibly lucky in technology

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,730
remote work who here gets to work

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:26,940
remotely Oh some of the time all the

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:29,480
time is it great oh that's great because

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:36,540
the person had a hand I was just like

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:41,220
who here has a dress code oh is it like

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,330
we're close generally speaking a lot of

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,940
us can rock into work wearing

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,520
essentially whatever we want the

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,350
opportunities start your own business we

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:55,140
aren't in San Francisco there's not free

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:56,459
money on every corner is there I'm

00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,510
getting a lot wrong here there's a lot

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,420
of people who are like no there's free

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,480
money there's this but we do have a lot

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,870
of opportunities for investment you've

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,140
got a weird opportunity to do something

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,500
you genuinely care about maybe you work

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,680
in accountancy software and maybe you

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,690
don't dream about accountancy software

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,880
but with one in four tech jobs being

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,790
unfilled and with open-source projects

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,190
with side projects you genuinely have

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,989
the opportunity to either spend some of

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,320
your free time building something that

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,540
legitimately changes the world or you

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,060
have the opportunity to get paid for

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,269
something you genuinely believe in this

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,280
is glorious you meet so many engineers

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,620
so many techies who've really

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,790
internalized that you say hey I'm really

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,890
lucky I must be great I'm a genius I

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,000
deserve all of this everything's

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,600
wonderful quite and it's tempting to go

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
that way

00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,239
working in tech for many people not for

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,630
everybody is pretty good relative to

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,070
other industries it's fantastic and

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,829
talking about that it's incredibly easy

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,709
to overlook that a lot of times tech

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,350
doesn't work for everyone and working in

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,950
technology isn't always well-suited for

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:20,930
people working in tech isn't always

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,580
designed for the way humans like to work

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,110
who here works someplace that has don't

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,850
raise your hands especially if your

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,640
co-workers here just like it

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,320
sarcastic eyebrows who here works

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,500
someplace that has a ton of crunch time

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,880
you get a lot of it's not unpaid because

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,360
there's a beer fridge but there's some

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:44,580
overtime right who has ever encountered

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,170
burnout oh oh there's like actual hands

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,240
going up or you can raise your hands if

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,300
you like as well who here has a

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,100
difficult time with work/life balance

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,370
within technology we often have a

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,930
terrible terrible time with that and

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,940
within technology discrimination

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:05,820
harassment or active problems that exist

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:09,110
so as the spoiler said everything in

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:13,530
technology is terrible but great

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,730
relative to some other things and it can

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,010
be really overwhelming you say

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,630
everything is terrible forever I'm just

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,850
gonna flip my table over I quit

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:25,650
there's nothing I can do it's a huge big

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:28,920
problem rawr and it is a big problem and

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,260
there are big problems and I've been

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,280
thinking about what we can do that small

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,600
and measured that has immediate impacts

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,810
who here knows about progressive

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,050
enhancement it just make a loud murmur

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,360
well good progress on the count of three

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,330
please yell your favorite one sentence

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:53,940
definition for progressive enhancement

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:55,830
one two three no no we're not laughing

00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,740
at you were laughing at me thinking that

00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,740
was gonna work one two three

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:08,430
y'all are terrible I'm talking about

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,820
progressive enhancement for the way we

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:15,750
work your workplaces and maybe slowly

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:22,800
for tech as a culture are we okay with

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:24,470
this fix what you can when you can do a

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,700
little more when you have the man with

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,430
fix the stuff that probably won't break

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,390
things

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,150
you're a lot too you're up here when we

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,410
were laughing at me so I'm gonna talk

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,050
about things we can do as individuals

00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,090
that immediately make our working lives

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,220
better and then I'm going to talk about

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,500
things we can do as company

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,760
can we maybe maybe eyebrows instead of

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,040
raising your hands so nobody jumps on

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,880
you who here is a manager or a boss who

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,200
runs your own thing y'all are terrible

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,560
and not raising your hands you're just

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,440
like you as individuals we have a

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,110
fantastic opportunity to mentor tutor

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,150
and champion if you're for coming into

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,610
the industry and you're brand new and

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,820
you're asking how do I find a job how do

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,350
I learn this what is networking like

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,680
having somebody willing to step up and

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:17,820
walk me through this can be an

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,800
incredible wonderful experience taking

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,560
the time if you know about what's going

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,830
on spotlight the people who are doing

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,940
great work taking the opportunity to say

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,180
hey do you know what I'm working in the

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,950
elixir community it's fantastic here are

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,139
great resources here great information

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,750
hi I've been working for this company

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,780
I can unreservedly recommend working for

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,550
them that's okay this is an immediate

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:46,140
positive thing we can do that costs us

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:48,450
nothing wherever you can and wherever

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,320
it's not a huge cost do outreach beyond

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,780
technology

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,820
who here has family that thinks that

00:07:51,780 --> 00:08:00,470
you're a magician you're like oh what

00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:05,340
what is such-and-such do o computers but

00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:07,500
websites but not talk about what you do

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,180
and the talk about the opportunities in

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,460
technology in ways that are

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,310
understandable for folks who don't work

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,110
in tech it's really tempting to make

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,960
yourself sound very very clever and

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:24,479
important what do you do huge pile of

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:27,660
technical jargon I mean your blowhard

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,889
auntie at Christmas yeah go for it but

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,500
if you're talking to folks where you

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:34,709
want to say I do this I help build

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,770
websites for cultural institutions I

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:40,529
help build learning tools I help speed

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,479
up the way people use the internet

00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:44,400
talking about things like that in

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,220
accessible way is talking about how you

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,810
got into it can really help grow the

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,420
pool of people who got into tech for the

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:54,060
first time who here had a traditional

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,580
computer science degree you went at

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,490
who here self trained or got into tech

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,640
through weird way is amazing

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,560
just by saying here's what I do in real

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,300
understandable ways you're giving new

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,560
people opportunities to join you and

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,890
you've got the opportunity as an

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,990
individual to make suggestions you can't

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,450
do big company changes on your own

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,820
unless you're the big boss but you can

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,860
say I'd love if we could do this

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,800
there was a really angry woman giving a

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,810
talk last night who told us to do that

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,000
there are really fantastic opportunities

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,860
to you for you to steer not just your

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,430
company but the tech communities you

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,050
exist in and I've helpfully color-coded

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,140
the stuff you can do with no risk and

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:44,460
light-blue I've got a couple slightly

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,380
higher risk ones you can as an

00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,600
individual working in technology you can

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,779
clearly set and enforce your boundaries

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,120
hi I need you to work late again tonight

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,200
you know just crunch time it'll be just

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,160
three four more weeks

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,370
sprint and a half that's fine one in

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:07,950
four tech jobs is unfilled you can

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:15,540
absolutely say no they're probably not

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:18,570
gonna fire you but by that probably has

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,040
a lot of wiggle room in it but by

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,110
setting and enforcing these boundaries

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,880
you're immediately making your life

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,020
slightly more difficult there's gonna be

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,330
some conflict there's gonna be some

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,339
pushback but you've got the potential to

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,680
make your own personal working life a

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,300
lot better and if you're clearly setting

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,220
these boundaries you're making things

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:43,459
better for your co-workers as well libel

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:46,380
laws a this the same way I want you

00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,760
spotlighting great places to work great

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,370
communities to work with and great

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,930
people to associate with whoever has

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,250
worked for someplace that you wish

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,690
someone had warned you about so I was

00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,690
again hoping for eyebrows before like

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,300
give people a gentle heads-up you don't

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,180
have to do this in a way that it could

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,160
expose yourself to legal liabilities you

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,860
can infer quite a bit

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:19,070
oh you're interviewing with company X Y

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:25,520
Z X Y Zed I've heard things about them

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:26,960
good things things you're tapping to

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,600
people who are fairly smart give them a

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,020
heads-up like oh you're getting involved

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:39,260
with this community I hear they have a

00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:41,780
lot going on use judicious eyebrows and

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,500
where you can challenge inappropriate

00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,720
behavior

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,340
don't just warn people you might not

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,680
want to hang out with that person or you

00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,410
might not want to work for that company

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,080
saying very clearly and in a calm even

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,060
tone that's not the way we do things I

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,740
wouldn't expect you to speak to someone

00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,150
like that

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,550
having your having your employees work

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,980
overtime every week isn't cool it's not

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,930
appropriate you're getting a really

00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,030
fantastic opportunity not just to set

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,620
your own boundaries but to set the

00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:15,740
expectations of what you have for people

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:17,390
around you those very excited people who

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:21,170
are like I've got my own company I can

00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:25,040
do whatever I want here's what I would

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:27,890
like you to do set very clear policies

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,280
around working hours and overtime there

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:34,130
are absolutely times where you need just

00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,520
a little bit more you've got a deadline

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,560
it's inflexible this has to happen be

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,020
very clear with your employees and very

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,950
clear with your teammates about why

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:48,380
there's X expectation you need some kind

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:53,140
of consensus yes this is worth it to us

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,140
and make those times rare and beautiful

00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:01,550
you can't just say I want everyone to go

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:04,520
home at insert arbitrary but appropriate

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,290
time here as leadership you actually

00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,290
have to do it as well

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:12,080
you have to turn off slack you have to

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,499
stop answering emails you have to set

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,629
the

00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:19,519
example that you want your employees to

00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:22,129
lead you've also got the opportunity to

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,229
do outreach into communities that are

00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:27,169
not currently represented in your talent

00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:29,719
if you look around and everybody at your

00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:32,509
table looks like you and sounds like you

00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:34,909
and things like you not only are you

00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:37,519
probably not getting enough ideas enough

00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:39,259
diversity of thought as it were but

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,749
you're also really limiting the pool of

00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:44,719
opportunities to folks who think like

00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:46,699
you and share your ideals a couple years

00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:50,179
ago I was incredibly pleased with myself

00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:52,659
I hired the only all-female develop

00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:55,129
developer relations team I had ever seen

00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:57,319
there were four of us we were hanging

00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:59,649
out it was fantastic we went out for

00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:02,509
drinks after work when it slowly

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:07,399
horrifyingly dawned on me that I had

00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:10,309
hired a bunch of Jessi's we all like the

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,679
same thing we had all gone to pretty

00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:14,929
much the same kind of school we all got

00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:18,169
along fantastically and I had done a

00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:19,879
terrible job in hiring make sure that

00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:22,009
you're looking for where other

00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,649
developers where other technologists are

00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:28,729
and what kinds of opportunities you can

00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:31,999
make more available to them it's

00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:34,970
incredibly difficult to quantify what

00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:37,129
you mean by doing a good job but make

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,289
sure that you're hiring and make sure

00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:42,109
you're promoting people based on very

00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:44,479
very clear formula if you're

00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:47,389
interviewing ask P ask everyone the same

00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:49,129
questions and score them we really like

00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,559
to think we're logical people following

00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:54,169
logical processes but if you have

00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:56,569
interviews and ask folks whatever comes

00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:59,239
to mind oh wow what did you do in your

00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:01,489
last project how is this huh you're just

00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:03,499
making a gut choice on like well that

00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:06,199
person was really cool I'm gonna hire

00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:07,999
them they sounded really good ask the

00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:12,229
same questions and give people the same

00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:15,349
opportunities to interact with you audit

00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:16,699
salaries for fairness whoo and you can

00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:18,379
eyebrows a raise your eyebrows if you

00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,669
want who's ever left a job because you

00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:24,979
found that you were being paid less than

00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:26,390
someone else I know right your talent

00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:27,860
will absolutely leave you

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,660
if you're under paying them and they

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,730
deserve to leave you if you're under

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,560
paying them if anybody here is getting

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,360
paid less than your co-workers like

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,830
please meet me for a free beer after

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,320
class where possible and where you can

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,210
seek out and remove the bad actors

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:50,270
does anybody know about the missing

00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:52,190
stare concept cool it's saying the

00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,410
missing stare concept is the idea that a

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,930
lot of times in families or

00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:00,130
organizations or social groups we get

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:04,310
really used to working around bad actors

00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,570
say well don't go to such and such for

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,030
feedback because they'll just yell at

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,250
you go do this instead go do that

00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,170
instead instead of having difficult

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,460
conversations and doing the difficult

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,650
thing of removing people that are

00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,270
causing damage you caused entire

00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,810
organizations to work around them

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:23,270
wherever possible listen to people ask

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,650
for their feedback and deliberately pull

00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:28,330
out those people who are making other

00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:31,040
people's lives more difficult offer

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:33,830
support and training if you're an

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,540
employer this has immediate benefit

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,320
you're teaching people more things

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:43,190
you're teaching people to use a lick sir

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,260
or whatever it has an immediate positive

00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,030
benefit for you when you talk to

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,880
developers and you talk to technologists

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,170
about why they left their job I found

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,340
out I was getting paid less than someone

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:57,230
else so-and-so was a jerk or I wasn't

00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,450
learning anything are the reasons you

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:03,140
hear again and again this is fantastic

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,940
for recruitment this is fantastic for

00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,510
retention but it's also the right thing

00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,610
to do and these are all little tiny

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,709
things you can do as individuals or as a

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,470
company to make your lives

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,360
immediately better in ways that slowly

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,270
contribute to the tech culture feeling

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,220
better you don't have to give up your

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,300
entire life and dedicate your life to

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,410
the cause but some people absolutely do

00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,510
some people see the things that are

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,220
broken in their company or in their

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,860
community or in the tech industry and

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,490
give everything up they go and do this

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:39,470
full-time that's also fantastic I don't

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,110
mean to sort of convert any of you and

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,640
send you rush

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,340
to dedicate your lives to making things

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,360
better but if there are people doing

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:50,400
that support them where they can this

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,340
has been a kind of depressing talk about

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,670
how everything's terrible but it's also

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,490
great it can be legitimately great not

00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:01,650
all of us it's not evenly distributed

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,590
but working in tech relative to other

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,929
industries we have either incredible

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:10,020
privileges or incredible opportunities

00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:11,429
for that but we've developed our

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,200
industry in a way that's not always

00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:16,530
healthy and doesn't always work well for

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,240
people but as individuals or as

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,700
companies we can make very very tiny

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,260
steps that almost immediately make our

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,820
lives less crushingly miserable and

00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,130
these teeny tiny steps have an

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:33,480
incredible potential to have an overall

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:35,850
cultural change that sucks less things

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,580
aren't always fantastic

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:41,150
we don't always work in ways that let us

00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,650
be the happy geniuses we'd like to be

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:47,850
but they can get a little bit better a

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:54,180
little bit at a time thank you very much

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:54,180
