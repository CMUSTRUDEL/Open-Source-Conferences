Title: HTTPS is Hard - Front-end London (FEL)
Publication date: 2016-07-14
Playlist: Front-End London
Description: 
	Making a site work on HTTPS should be easy, but it's not. The older your website, the harder it is to make the transition—but why? Steve Workman takes you through a 9 month journey, of how we moved Yell.com to HTTPS; overcoming a 20-year-old website and its many tiers to get that green padlock, and what actually happens when you make such a breaking change.
