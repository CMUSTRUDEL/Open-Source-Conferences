	00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:10,400
so as Ilya said I'm a product manager

00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,110
here and might be thinking why is the

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,360
product manager talking to us what's

00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,580
this got to do with what we do what are

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,259
we going to learn from this and so I'm

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,150
going to keep you in suspense on that

00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:23,149
for the time being and we're going to

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,640
start with this so this is actually an

00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:28,009
IKEA rad fir which is not the point of

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,020
the slide but what it does is it Ellis

00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:32,899
traits kind of one of my slightly

00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,260
nightmare scenarios um I've only just

00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:39,080
noticed the kid in the background though

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,000
and so this is like one of those parties

00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,280
that you go to where everyone is really

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,560
cool and there's lots of new people and

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,580
they maybe don't all work in tech so

00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,320
you're kind of getting outside of the

00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,650
bubble when you're kind of like this is

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,460
great and it's not I hate parties or

00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:57,650
meeting new people or fun but inevitably

00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,630
the first question that anyone asks when

00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,480
you meet them and it has actually

00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:05,930
happened tonight already um is so what

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:10,940
do you do much like that

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:13,280
and this is hard for me because you kind

00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,590
of kind of take a deep breath and I know

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,020
what the reactions going to be and I say

00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,580
well I'm a product manager and you

00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,560
almost always get this kind of blank

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:27,350
stare or you get also you're a project

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,500
manager and I'm just like oh no that's

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,330
not at all what I do or if they follow

00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,080
up with this question so what like what

00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:38,210
do you actually do day-to-day and so I

00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,680
kind of try things like well you know so

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,010
maybe they don't understand what product

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,920
is I make useful websites and apps for

00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,810
people but then you kind of have a say

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,390
also you're you're a developer you're a

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,950
designer and you can't like oh no that's

00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,900
not what I am either I might kind of

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,360
just tell people what to make and I'm

00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,689
like no I really don't tell people what

00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,220
to make because although I've got

00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:03,729
manager and my job I don't actually

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,080
manage anybody in any conventional sense

00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,280
and you're probably still thinking well

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,189
how is this relevant does it really

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,099
matter if these people party know what I

00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:15,499
do and so these aren't the people I'm

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,359
concerned about they doesn't really

00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:18,680
matter if they know what I do I might

00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:20,450
have an awkward conversation

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,870
and be a bit like her it would have been

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,519
really nice to have not been awkward but

00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,620
it does matter that the people that I'm

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,200
working with know what I do because a

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,569
big part of my job actually is to kind

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,769
of help other people do their job better

00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:39,709
so that we can all succeed and and so in

00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:43,969
kind of the course of thinking about

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:45,469
this talk I've been collecting phrases

00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:47,810
or ways that you describe product

00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:50,900
managers so I did what any kind of

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,549
self-respecting infinity person does and

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,109
went to medium and typed in product

00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,989
management wise a product manager and

00:02:54,109 --> 00:03:00,379
you quickly realize for this kind of

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:02,209
tens or hundreds of articles almost

00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:06,040
exclusively written by project product

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:08,540
product I've done it product managers

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,519
they're covering like what is a what a

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,530
product manager is what they are how

00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,750
they should be how we can be better what

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,219
they definitely shouldn't be doing and

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,049
it quickly becomes clear there's just

00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:20,780
many different ways of defining what it

00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:22,729
is that we do and here at made by many

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,220
it's something that we have been kind of

00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:28,280
over the last year and a half it's a

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,569
relatively new job title here and roll's

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,359
it's something we've been trying to

00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:34,790
define especially where we work

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:36,019
where we're talking about clients so

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,760
we're not looking after a product

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,239
directly ourselves in quite the same way

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,489
and so I also fought ok so medium hasn't

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,729
really helped me maybe I'll go and ask

00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,620
our developers here what they think I do

00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:51,049
actually they did quite well they didn't

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,060
say anything that was offensive and all

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,069
of the things that they said were things

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,069
that I consider part of my job but there

00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,419
was still a huge variety of answers and

00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,579
none of them were probably what I would

00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:06,859
say myself so these are some of the

00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:07,699
things I have collected ah yeah there's

00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:10,699
some good ones

00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:13,370
I kind of agree in part with it all of

00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:15,620
them to some degree my personal favorite

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,209
is janitor not because it's demeaning

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,400
but because I actually think it gets to

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,909
the core of what my day-to-day reality

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,710
sometimes is yeah you have wondered he

00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:26,479
does data entry when you're like we need

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,969
to put all the content in this it's

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,810
probably a product manager somewhere and

00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:32,650
I also found this

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:37,849
which I just let you absorb for a second

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:39,349
and I worry that this is true a lot of

00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:41,990
the time I don't think I've ever really

00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:43,759
considered myself Superman but I've

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,509
definitely been moments where you feel

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:51,199
like a headless chicken and to kind of

00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:53,120
stop that feeling and to stop running

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,240
around in circles and having people

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,699
wonder what I'm doing why I'm doing it

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,349
am i doing anything at all and there's

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,949
three big questions that I really think

00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:05,900
this boils down to so I think ultimately

00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,370
for me product management boils down to

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,919
and this is the difference between a

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,169
project manager and a product manager

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:14,090
what is the right product why is that

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,469
the right thing and how do we make it

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,699
happen

00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:22,610
and I put these in a triangle of

00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:24,919
uncertainty because they're not all

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,409
independent questions but you can kind

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,840
of answer simply you can't answer any of

00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:33,680
these in isolation and each of them is

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,539
continually informing the other and so

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,569
as we find out more about kind of what

00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:40,219
something should be and why it should be

00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:43,520
we're then moving on to thinking about

00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:45,229
how do we achieve that but as we start

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,849
making progress with how and getting

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:50,300
into details we probably need to go back

00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,889
and revisit why we're doing it in the

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,110
first place as we kind of figure out

00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:58,960
well should it behave in this way or

00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:02,150
that way and so it made by many for what

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,960
we're always aiming for is the right

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,879
product this is our Venn diagram that we

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,620
use extensively and if you've ever seen

00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:13,610
anyone from a by many talk anywhere

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,139
before you've probably seen it so we're

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,349
aiming for that bit in the middle there

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:20,870
is this really slim sliver between what

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,750
the customers need and what's right for

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:29,659
the business and that's kind of our

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:31,400
sweet spot but getting to that war as I

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:34,159
said needs to be continually guided by

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,819
the why and the how and I said it's a

00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:40,219
triangle of ambiguity and so part of my

00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:41,990
job a very large part is navigating that

00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:44,630
and helping other people to navigate it

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,040
and I kind of think this is for a

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,660
product manager most in

00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,090
Austan thing is being able to ask the

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,250
right questions at the right time to the

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:56,870
right people in order to figure out all

00:06:52,250 --> 00:07:02,090
of these things and make progress so big

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:05,240
question mark we always have kind of a

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,920
starting point for reference in this

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,390
case I'm going to sort of be assuming

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,430
we're thinking about a product that

00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,550
already exists in some way shape or form

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,370
and so the one thing that helps to guide

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,340
all of those questions for me is having

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,600
a kind of a product vision in mind and

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,700
so for those of you that may not know

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,040
kind of exactly what a product vision is

00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,870
and should be it's something that looks

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,910
into the future they kind of tend to be

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,090
big and bold and they serve as

00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,440
inspiration and direction and allude to

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,930
the problem is that we're trying to

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,000
solve so we like to refer to them a lot

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,170
as our North Star because that's that's

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,300
where we're going that's where we're

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,380
headed and we might be taking small

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,120
steps to get there

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,660
but that's what we're trying to do and

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,970
for me the absolute best ones as well

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:53,690
help you make all of the decisions you

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,860
need to make on that journey and those

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,650
the vasila questions it can be

00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:00,590
everything from which feature to

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,140
prioritize over another one how they

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,430
should be implemented which things we

00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,200
should just kill because they're never

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,240
going anywhere what we should be

00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,550
tackling right now because it's going to

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,350
have the most impact and what we can

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,400
unlike what can wait for a next spin

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:18,860
sprint or a future one so I've just

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,390
ranted about vision for a few minutes

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:26,170
but ultimately this is an important one

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,820
I keep thinking I've got a clicker Oh

00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:32,240
product managers are facilitators not

00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,770
visionaries and so I think if you're in

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,360
a situation where a product manager is

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,940
kind of acting like a product dictator

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,790
and telling people to solve our to solve

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,280
for problems and not figuring out with

00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,950
an awesome team that for me is doing it

00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,680
really really wrong you know I believe

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,120
the only way to make something right to

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,820
make that kind of right product that

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,190
we're all aiming for I hope is by

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,350
listening to a lot of people and working

00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,760
with everyone as a team and that's

00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,730
something that is particularly relevant

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,910
to this role of

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,190
product management because as a product

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,920
manager actually my experience and

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,850
knowledge kind of goes across a load of

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,610
disciplines but a relatively shallow

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,470
level so you know thinking about design

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,750
I might be able to sketch out a user

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,790
journey but I can't do the actual design

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,880
of an interface and make it look amazing

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,649
and really work for people I can do some

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,709
budgeting and understand business models

00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:30,029
but I'm not an amazing finance whiz he's

00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,970
going to be able to solve all of your

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:38,399
kind of future profit projections for

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:42,060
example and I can sort of talk tech Ilha

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,649
laughs um but I definitely can't code

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,480
anything in there she wants some kind of

00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:49,949
like very nineties iframes but for you

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,510
and why I want to talk to you really is

00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,550
because your knowledge and your skills

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,529
are far far deeper than mine

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,959
so whereas I kind of touch a bit of

00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:00,660
everything you actually are the experts

00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:06,209
and I couldn't do my job my job wouldn't

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:09,029
exist without you log and if I wasn't

00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:10,620
around you kind of you might miss me if

00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:14,010
I got hit by bus I'd hope you'd be

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,310
slightly sad but you would ultimately

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,569
still be able to make something um I'm

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,699
going to argue that I don't think it

00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:24,420
would necessarily be the right thing but

00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:27,269
you could still build something because

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,250
ultimately even with this kind of

00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:30,440
amazing deep knowledge where you really

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,639
know your stuff

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,779
when we're thinking about a product

00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,870
we're trying to make we're actually all

00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:40,800
part of this much much bigger team and

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,750
so down here that's probably developers

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,190
designers the people working directly in

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,279
building stuff on a product team

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,230
together with all sorts of people that

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,810
might then be a stakeholder in what

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,069
you're doing so you might have to make

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,899
friends with finance person your CEO or

00:10:55,069 --> 00:11:00,180
strategist whoever kind of is that

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,589
visionary it's probably going to turn up

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,260
with some very strong opinions

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:06,510
we've got marketing customer service and

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,949
of course really importantly the actual

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,130
customers the people we're building this

00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:12,360
thing for and all of these people in the

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,470
same way that you have this depth

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,060
knowledge about be

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,100
young developers on how to write code

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,590
and how to make stuff they all have the

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,890
same level of depth of expertise as you

00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:25,790
do in their own particular fields and me

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,960
I see it somewhere in the middle they're

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,410
possibly slightly closer to a product

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:36,030
team than anyone else but that's kind of

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:38,670
my happy happy place mostly happy place

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,290
it's where uncomfortable because what

00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:44,880
I'm trying to do at every point in a

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:47,790
product proper project when making a

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,070
product is kind of hear all of these

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,560
people's opinions I want to know what's

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,570
motivating them what they're thinking

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,550
about what they're worried about well

00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,740
their goals are where they want to be

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,990
and helping all of them to come together

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,620
to build something that works for

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,510
everyone

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,930
so for me this is really a kind of a

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:09,450
position of facilitation negotiation a

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:12,840
bit of persuasion is far more about that

00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:16,260
than it is for about leadership and the

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,270
big thing here is really my role here is

00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,190
to kind of stop any one of those parties

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,290
becoming too loud or Donna McDonald --nt

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,090
it's all about trying to balance all of

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:27,180
these inputs to find something that's

00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,770
actually going to work for people and

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,840
it's not necessarily just people either

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:34,020
there's also kind of on top of this you

00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,690
might have quantitative data what your

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,670
competitors are doing changes in kind of

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,260
broad technology landscapes for so many

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,850
different things that have to be

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:46,650
considered when we're aiming for the

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,420
right product and another way for me to

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,550
describe this is really that there's a

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,990
bunch of people that sit a very high

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,270
level who are thinking about that

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,710
product vision in a long-term way so

00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,710
they're thinking about where are we

00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:01,290
going to be in the next year three years

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,660
five years and then as developers I

00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:06,240
think you probably often find yourselves

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,800
right in the kind of now and the

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,480
implementation and the particular

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,610
feature that you're working on at any

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,200
given moment and so you're kind of

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,720
looking at things from this very minut

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,550
detail and so a big part of what I tried

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,430
to do is translate between those two

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,290
things to help people who are at that

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,660
high level understand the problems that

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,270
come when you're actually implementing

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,720
their grand vision and to help the

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,029
people who

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,089
we're doing that implementation

00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:36,120
understand the why a lot better and as I

00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:39,180
said a big part of how I do this is by

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,930
asking questions and forming hypotheses

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:46,500
and trying to validate them so here's

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:49,230
the hypothesis for you I think we can

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,180
make better more successful products by

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,129
all thinking a little bit more like a

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,500
product manager I'm not going to try and

00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:57,269
convince anyone to become one but I

00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,610
think there is some things in that kind

00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:02,610
of world and skill set that can help

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,509
everyone to do their jobs better you

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,860
probably thought I was just going to

00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:08,550
talk to you about what product manager

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,560
is without asking anything but there are

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:14,129
a few ways I think we can all start to

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:18,389
do this and and I think this is the

00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:20,730
first step it's like for me the worst

00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:23,430
developers to work with are the ones

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,810
that are just like I'm really great at

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,189
writing code you're just going to give

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,259
me stories I'm going to write in a

00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:30,209
really beautiful way and I'll do it

00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:34,019
exactly as it's described and it'll be

00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:36,209
done that's painful

00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,860
what I actually want is the people to

00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,889
kind of look at the backlog look at the

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,860
tasks and consider user stories within

00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:47,189
that wider context of why are we doing

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,550
this who it's for and how can I build

00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:52,649
this in a way that best serves them

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,329
which kind of leads on to encouraging

00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:58,079
everyone to step away from their screens

00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:59,850
occasionally it does happen and I'm sure

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,759
I'm also not the first person to stand

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:06,809
up at kind of dev conference and say you

00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,459
should all go and meet your users but I

00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:10,350
think that is one of the first steps if

00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:12,240
you have the potential and you're able

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,230
to go and out and meet customers and

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,059
speak to them directly

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,600
it can make it a lot easier for you to

00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,279
know how something should be built is

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,069
there's nothing quite like sitting down

00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:26,339
with the user seeing them use the thing

00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:31,139
that you've been working on for days

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:32,850
will be will be a generous and seeing

00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:35,069
that they struggle to use their or that

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,679
the loading time is unrealistic for the

00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:39,329
device they're using it on and it's not

00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,220
just about customers either as I said

00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:43,770
they're kind of one part of

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,170
big force that brings a product into

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:48,240
being I'd also urge everyone to kind of

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,370
step away from their computer within the

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,230
office as well whether it's in the

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,200
kitchen and just talk to the person who

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,870
you have no idea what their job is find

00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,430
out what their concerns are and then the

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,770
next time someone comes down over like

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,090
we must build this feature now you might

00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,500
have a better understanding of where

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:10,110
they're coming from and be able to solve

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:14,010
that in a better way call my office is

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:17,220
dangerous or not I think a lot of people

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,320
also think product managers are in

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,810
charge of the process and we kind of say

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,430
this is how it should be done but

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,040
especially Preveza bits that aren't from

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,440
a tech background it's not always clear

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,990
to us how we can best help and to make

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,270
work more efficient efficiently and

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,830
ultimately no matter how good we are at

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,570
listening to our customers listening to

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,610
stakeholders if we don't get something

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,000
out the door it's kind of a work for

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,530
nothing

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,080
and so I think from that perspective I

00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:48,570
think product managers are really kind

00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,740
of pragmatists there are some things

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,410
obviously we want to do and make sure

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,570
happen but ultimately you're the experts

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,030
on things like estimation and exactly

00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,210
how long it takes to build something or

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:02,790
the benefits of one way of doing a

00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,439
feature versus another and I really want

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,270
to encourage everyone to like feel that

00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,760
you can own that process you're working

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,589
with to make it more efficient and suit

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,120
the way you work and let you do better

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:19,350
work ultimately it kind of all boils

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,819
down to me as they ask more questions so

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,020
there was the three questions at the

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,170
beginning and I think those are things

00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,819
we can all use in whatever we're doing

00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:29,670
to really guide and make the work that

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:31,380
we're doing better so the stuff you can

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,820
ask yourself so it's what are we really

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,770
trying to achieve with building this

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,170
thing who is it for

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,410
how is it going to be used how can it

00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,120
help us to get to that vision and their

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,490
things to ask people around you as well

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,890
so whether it's colleagues or clients or

00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:50,400
customers using that kind of curiosity

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:52,440
to sniff out their motivations and fears

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,940
and develop a better understanding of

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,960
our point of view can be really helpful

00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,740
when

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,700
unexpected kind of curveball flights in

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,059
and that's what I really want to leave

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,100
you of is that I think there has been

00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:07,529
you know I hear of tension between

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,630
product managers and developers and I

00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:11,010
think it's largely because you don't

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,809
feel enough ownership or a product

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,940
manager is holding onto stuff too much

00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:17,850
and actually this is all a shared

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,010
responsibility so I'm not shared across

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,750
the team is the only way that we can

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,120
navigate the kind of uncertainty of

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,679
getting to the right thing and of trying

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,169
to make products that are right for the

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,600
business and for the customer is to find

00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:32,940
out what we don't know what we need to

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,620
ask to find the next answer if it's

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,850
going to help us release the next thing

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,029
but it's going to get a little bit

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:41,270
closer to where we're going

00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:41,270
