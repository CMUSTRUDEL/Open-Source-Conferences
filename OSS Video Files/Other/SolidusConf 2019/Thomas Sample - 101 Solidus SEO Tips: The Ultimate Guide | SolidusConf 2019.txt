00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:29,810
reality so a big round of plus to

sauce my brother-in-law I grew all those

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,020
peppers that's a picture of some bone

00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:40,549
broth at the bottom I've been making

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,789

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:46,999
delicious I've been chopping wood I love

00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:49,009
hiking I love to play guitar of course I

00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,060
love to work out I don't know how

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,509
anybody can work in this industry

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,279
without getting some physical exercise a

00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:56,450
little bit about Karma creative you may

00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:58,399
have seen this slide last year but I

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,069
left it in because really expresses our

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,170
values very well at Karma we believe in

00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:04,609
giving back first that starts with a

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,490
developer meaning that we pay people

00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:10,130
fairly wherever they live no geolocation

00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,540
alarbus rise second of all it means

00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,420
helping clients succeed in their

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,490
business not just making a website it's

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,660
very important to us it also means

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,849
giving back to the open source community

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,700
and making sure that we give back

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,350
wherever we can and finally it means

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,330
giving it means building long

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,460
term relationships with clients rather

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,860
than sure engagements so that we can

00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,230
provide holistic digital services now my

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,840
holistic services I mean photography

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,850
graphic design web development social

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,490
media everything working together in

00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,340
tandem to try to provide that business

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,360
value that the client is looking for so

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,830
let's jump into the meat of the talk

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,970
first of all planning first tip I have

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,870
for you which is perhaps the most

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:56,030
important start early on SEO you got to

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,860
start running right now it's a marathon

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,140
it's not a sprint I said this last year

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,910
it's true so start planning your SEO

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,670
strategy before your websites released

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,520
and let's talk about keywords first

00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,750
keywords are key one of my favorite

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,220
tools that I found this year while

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,410
researching was this one answer the

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,180
public it provides a really nice visual

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,490
representation of keyword generation

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,470
around question keywords which are great

00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,300
for longtail keyword targeting and also

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,200
voice search which is very important

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,690
we're going to talk about it a little

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,010
bit but as you can see it really

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,480
organizes you in such a great way where

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,430
you can just kind of pull any of those

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,720
questions off and make a blog post about

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,780
it if you that's not what you want to

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,100
use for content strategy but you know

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,600
there's a hundred and one tips in this

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,340
talk so if I go through all of them this

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,320
slow we won't get through 101 of them so

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,330
here's another list of tools where we

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,590
can all use for keyword generation of

00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,860
course there's buzz sumos question

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,990
analyzer a refs LSI graph for those

00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,910
latent semantic keywords you can just do

00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,880
searches in forums for non exact

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,290
keywords to use five-minute site is

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,600
another really nice resource around

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,760
local keywords so you can add in city

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,640
names targeted by zip code that kind of

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,310
thing and also you can use keyword tool

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,810
IO which is great and Amazon's autofill

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,190
tool and as we talked about last year

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,900
this is a great place for keyword

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,060
especially that have high buyer intent

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,010
you know with keywords we're looking for

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,210
that magic combination of a low keyword

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,940
difficulty meaning there's not a lot of

00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,950
competition high search traffic and a

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,370
high buyer intent and Amazon's keywords

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,620
they're targeted all around that so we

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,990
can then look at a few other keyword

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,810
sources Google and Apple's autocomplete

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,700
gules box that says people also ask

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,599
remember just rolling through these

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,309
generating a big list of keywords

00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:36,990
you'll notice that as we go through the

00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:39,119
talk some of the tips are highlighted in

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,529
green these are the tips that I think if

00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:42,059
you don't take anything else away from

00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:44,099
this presentation you should be focused

00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:45,149
on there's a lot in here and I can

00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:46,050
understand it can kind of get

00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:47,279
overwhelming

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,749
so these are the ones I felt like we're

00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,669
most important for you to focus on if

00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:52,589
you don't take anything else and here in

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,509
keyword research Google Ads

00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,249
keyword and planner tool if you're doing

00:04:54,509 --> 00:05:00,860
keywords research you have to check this

00:04:56,249 --> 00:05:03,119
out also Google searches related to box

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,379
so we're done with the keyword research

00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,819
although we'll come back to keywords

00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,740
throughout the presentation let's talk a

00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,139
little about voice search but first why

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,469
should you care about voice search well

00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,629
60% of searches from mobile our voice

00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:18,119
searches today right now over half of

00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:20,219
mobile searches and more than half of

00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:21,479
global traffic is coming from mobile so

00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,360
you do the math you put these two things

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,649
together voice is very important so

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,199
let's talk about some tips related to

00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:30,360
that using longtail keywords of five

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,449
words or more not these old-school three

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,679
word but like a five word keyword

00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,839
switching from generic keywords to

00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:39,869
question keywords how do how does why

00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,149
why is this where do I get and of course

00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:45,360
using question search engines like Korra

00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:47,189
Yahoo Answers Axe Jeeves even ask geez

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,449
look up find different questions that

00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:51,689
you could be asking find what people are

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:54,599
searching for within your topic another

00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:57,629
important one I love this tip is to

00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:59,369
create an FAQ page this targets long

00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:01,740
tail keywords and it targets those

00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:03,509
question keywords in voice and it can

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,639
even impact eat which we're gonna talk

00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,349
about in just a little while to improve

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,959
your expertise or perhaps your authority

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:11,959
or trust within your space this is a

00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,819
great set write that one down

00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:16,349
we can also use local intent keywords

00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:17,639
such as neighborhood city and state we

00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:19,199
talked about using that tool a five

00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,869
minute site to generate some of those

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,979
keywords and of course if we're talking

00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:24,839
about voice search you want to fill in

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,879
your Google listings so that when people

00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,439
search to find out your hours maybe

00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,919
Google will even give you the answer

00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,269
verbally let's talk about eat that's the

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,969
next thing this is the latest greatest

00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:37,529
hottest thing in SEO right now really it

00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:40,199
comes from the quality rater guidelines

00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,639
so Google has this process where they

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,279
have a whole bunch of individual people

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,110
ten thousand or so of them reading their

00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,280
websites using a document called a

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,560
quality rater guide

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,670
and from that we can extract some

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,710
important information about the

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,140
algorithm works now these guidelines

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,730
don't directly impact algorithm they're

00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,380
more like a comment card that a

00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,580
restaurant gives out after the service

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,700
is already done it's kind of just a

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,050
feedback check but in these guidelines

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,990
one of the most important things that

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,520
recently came out is the concept of

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,520
expertise authoritative Ness and Trust

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,080
these three things tell Google that

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,030
you're a site that they should be

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,590
providing to the users we recently had

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,870
an update on your money and your life

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,430
where they got a lot stricter about this

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,750
around any products they're being sold

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,120
there any information related to your

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,040
health so what does it really mean they

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,210
sound kind of similar well expertise

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,290
that means you're an expert in your

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,620
field you're really knowledgeable

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,540
authoritative Nagri that you're

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,740
knowledgeable not just you have the

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,260
knowledge but other people have a

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,090
consensus on it and finally trust do

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,700
people trust you back in the Panda

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,680
update in 2009 that Google put out 23

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,870
different questions that we can ask such

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,280
as you know with someone tolerate

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,500
putting a credit card into your website

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,630
to gauge trust well back in the

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,550
beginning of July July 4 in August

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,560
August first they came out with a new

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,090
list of 22 questions which you can again

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,740
use to value it how much people will

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,350
trust you and they're all along this

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,320
concept of eat so what can you do what

00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,120
are some tips around these concepts

00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,680
expertise well first off we can just

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,440
generate well-written content that has

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,660
facts may be primary sources we can also

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,280
keep that content up to date so you

00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,050
might have something in there and it

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,910
changes if it was a news article there's

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,300
some new information you can provide

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:23,280
those in relevant updates and even

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,080
create new content and you could even do

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,610
something like adding a trusted badge to

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,580
your footer which engine I remember

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,370
mentioned last year authoritative Ness

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,750
we can get links from websites that

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,490
already have Authority when their field

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,780
really this is about back like you know

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,539
what our back links backlinks are

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,190
essentially recommendations so when

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,990
someone links to you like if you're a

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,300
medical website and the American

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,580
pediatric associated links to you that's

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,450
them giving you some sort of authority

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,950
of saying you're an authority in your

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,260
space we trust information you're

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,050
providing you can try to get mentioned

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,520
in the news or on a reputable media site

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,520
or you can even just get mentioned on

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,350
Wikipedia or make your own page let's

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,750
start a trust

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,730
couple things here first off at a

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,900
contact us page if you don't have one

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,610
you need to add one you should have a

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,840
phone number there and you should make

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,360
sure that that information is the same

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,950
as what you find on Whois page Google

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,720
likes to see consistency across the web

00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,950
there's an easy thing to do like that

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,400
Thank You page if you don't already have

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,610
it

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,680
have a clear refund and return policy I

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,300
mean this isn't rocket science but if

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,890
Google sees that if the quality raters

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,260
see that they like that that's gonna

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,880
provide an SEO boost have comprehensive

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,020
specifications of the product if the

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,910
products are sold don't just have a

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,470
one-word description how many of us have

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,000
had a website where there's a product up

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,860
then it has a very short description

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,990
with one picture those just don't sell

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,660
and of course add testimonials from

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,370
customers you can also add outbound

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,950
links from your own site to other

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,600
reputable sites to show that you can be

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,860
trusted you know you're not the only one

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,500
giving this information look other

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,380
sources say the same thing you can add a

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,390
Terms of Service page and a privacy page

00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,330
again indications that you should be

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,580
trusted these are standard practices for

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,800
trustworthy members of the web and you

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,720
can provide supplementary content which

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,450
plays into a bunch of different things

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,620
including original content in that

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,150
people will spend more time on your

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,130
website if they're using say the loan

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,630
calculator and your bank website they're

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,110
gonna have a higher dwell time so

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,130
they're gonna stay there longer and the

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,710
last thing we're going to talk about in

00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,300
trust is reviews everybody needs reviews

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,980
you need good reviews probably the most

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,230
important source that Google mentions is

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,540
the Better Business Bureau but wherever

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,390
you can get them you need them this is

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,170
really social proof that your product is

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:38,210
a good product and you can be trusted

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:42,770
let's take a break for a second it

00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:44,390
breaks over time for technical SEO we

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,040
made it through planning now let's try

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,630
to focus on some things maybe we can

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,000
take care of with code well roll through

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,160
these real quick first keep URLs as

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,020
short as possible make sure to have your

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,960
keywords in those URLs make sure that

00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,220
any spaces are dashes and underscores

00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,870
reduce or eliminate your parameters and

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,640
those URLs is possible to concentrate

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,000
your search juice and make sure to use

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,960
SSL we should all be doing that right

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,640
check to make sure there's only one

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,020
version of your website accessible we

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,580
mentioned this last year it's still an

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,480
important tip you still see sites where

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,560
there's more than one version out there

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,700
just be one of these four

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,520
this one here is a very important tip

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,710
highlighted in green you should do an

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,470
audit of your own site use the tool use

00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,330
a graphs you screaming frog audit it do

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,980
you have missing links or broken links

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,750
do you have missing alt texts do you

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,180
have titles that are too long to

00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,700
duplicate content this is something that

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,280
can be done in only a few hours and can

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,080
provide really valuable insights and

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,690
low-hanging fruit for you to grab and

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,310
while we're on the topic another low

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,840
hanging fruit is Google search console

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,070
if you're not using this this is

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,320
probably the number one tip from the

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,850
whole talk use Google search console you

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,110
should be registered there Google will

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,090
tell you what's wrong with your site

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,770
Google will provide feedback and there's

00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,860
even some enhancements that will go over

00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,270
an structured data like products like

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,530
recent improvements to the search

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,270
console they're still working on it

00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,320
talking about mobile for a second we

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,000
don't have too much in talking about it

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,320
but you do need to make sure that your

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,910
mobile content that you're serving is

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,620
the same as your desktop content if

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,210
you're not doing that Google now

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,560
penalizes you for that they want to see

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,480
a consistent experience and they're

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,220
indexing mobile first now meaning the

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,930
version of your website indexed is the

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,970
mobile version you're just gonna see

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,610
some sort of penalty if you also have

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:25,000
content that's on desktop you don't show

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:29,090
on that mobile first indexed version a

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,460
few do's for metadata make sure every

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,050
page on your site has a title tag this

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,810
is probably the most important SEO

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,760
element it shouldn't be that you sell

00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,830
educational toys and the title of your

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,230
page is education - the name of your

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,430
website that's not descriptive and

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,470
Google doesn't like to see that you

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,750
should have toys in your name if the

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,430
page is educational toys we get trapped

00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,470
in categories sometimes maybe that

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,180
category is education and that's how we

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,650
go down these rabbit holes but we need

00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,540
to make sure our title tag is quality

00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,210
not just programmatically generated but

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,710
a good title tag and you want to place

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,960
your keyword at the beginning of it and

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,510
you want to carry through those keywords

00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,940
in your image file names and any alt

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,800
tags you use and when it comes to the

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,450
tongue tag check your results look at

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,710
what you're seeing in Google and see if

00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,070
you're getting truncations or anything

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,300
like that

00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:19,850
a few don'ts don't use home or profile

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,680
or any kind of generic words and don't

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,840
spend any time at all on medical words

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,670
these do not matter at all and I just

00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,180
completely useless at this point

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,980
ignore them next is the description a

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,900
lot of people tell you this doesn't

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,000
matter and while it's true it doesn't

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,580
directly impact your index it does

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,770
impact your ultimate ranking because it

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,510
impacts the modification engine when you

00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,340
have a really good Meta Description on

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,170
your page it acts like a Google ad

00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,000
getting people to click through more

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,680
often to your site and when the

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,410
click-through rate is higher you'll get

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,940
a boost in your rankings so and this

00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,530
second part talks about make sure

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,450
absolutely should be obvious but your

00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:58,220
Meta Description isn't the same over all

00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,960
of your pages Google will penalize this

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,840
they might even pull in your nav text

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,630
and that's terrible so let's all make

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,650
sure to set a sensible Meta Description

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:10,040
we want from metadata we can talk about

00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:12,620
structure data a little bit json-ld is

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,330
our preferred choice and really what

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,830
this is doing is providing extra

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,720
information to Google so we can have

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,010
rich product snippets and things like

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,200
that in the search results you can get

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,820
that zero result of the answer box doing

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,130
this or for products you can get your

00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,630
products listened to the top of the page

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,490
you can utilize search consoles new

00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,260
feature to check how your product

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,120
structure data is performing even

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,800
without using the structured data

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,600
testing tool but then of course you can

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,330
just run over to the structured a

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,440
decibel and test all of your pages for

00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,840
all the different kinds of structured

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,780
data that you have not just products and

00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,450
also of course you can use RNA gem

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,150
solidus SEO which does almost all this

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,280
for you and a little more on that later

00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,840
so let's optimize your speed we're gonna

00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,640
need some speed to get over this jump

00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,220
for us going to know how fast we're

00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,620
going you're gonna use a tool like

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,990
webpagetest.org or ping tums website

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,370
speed test a refs yslow these are all

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,170
tools to check how fast you're going and

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,000
then once you know you can know how we

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,140
can improve from there so what's the

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,690
first thing we want to do to improve

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,280
reduce or redirect redirects as much as

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,440
possible we don't want those redirects

00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,500
they slow us down this is simple but

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,940
minify CSS HTML and JavaScript make sure

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,490
you gzip any of those assets that are

00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,030
over 150 bits and configure

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,830
paper-clipped

00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,680
optimize all your images that is if you

00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,300
use paperclip and if you do solidus SEO

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,920
again does this for you if you don't

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,320
optimize your images anyway it's very

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,530
important to PageSpeed let's talk about

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,300
cache everybody loves cache right

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:40,240
you want to make sure it can use

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,610
consistent URLs identify which resources

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,230
can be cached and catch them with CDN to

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,640
make sure that we have the shortest

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:49,030
possible distance for the data to travel

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,010
and here's an important tip we want to

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,600
make sure to minimize churn by pulling

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,730
out any of those resources that change

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,680
frequently so that they can be updated

00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,510
on their own and we don't have to clear

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,810
the whole cache for one little typo or

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:04,120
something like that

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,980
no times important to performance and

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,050
there's a few things that we need to do

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,570
fast we need a check for bottlenecks we

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:14,200
don't want to perform slowly on n plus 1

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:19,420
queries slow routing slow typing that's

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:21,090
all gonna get in the way of our speed we

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,800
want to make sure to reduce DNS lookups

00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:27,460
we're already up to 66 now so bear with

00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,930
me we're making it there 66 is a very

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,550
important tip though we want to define a

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,710
critical load path think about what

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,940
you're loading above the fold is there a

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,070
way that you can load part of your page

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,170
the part that's first render before the

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,820
rest of it Google sees this as a faster

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,440
speed so you don't necessarily have to

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,330
improve the speed on your whole page if

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:48,250
you can focus on that part above the

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:51,400
fold okay original content let's jump

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,380
right in tip 67 avoid keyword

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,030
cannibalization don't split your search

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,250
juice over multiple pages if you have a

00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:59,050
result at five and a 10 you might be

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,550
able to rank at two if you weren't

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,220
targeting that same keyword on both

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,660
pages make sure you include at least

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,610
your keyword in the first hundred words

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,819
and another two to three times within

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,380
the first 300 words and definitely don't

00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,300
stuff your keywords I mean that second

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,800
tip should cover the fact that you're

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,680
not stopping them but don't stop them

00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:21,520
like Google hates that now you can add

00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,959
modifiers such as 2019 or best review to

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,209
your title to help rank for some of

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,150
these longer till keywords and you can

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:30,400
try to predict the searches of your

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,810
customers and possibly target content

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,950
gap keywords where there's something

00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:36,340
that people are searching for and

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,810
there's no good content for it yet you

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,150
can use targeted keyword lists to

00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,710
generate these topic ideas perhaps even

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,080
make a video and while we're on the

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,490
topic let's talk about mind mapping the

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,230
search intent because you know Google

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,300
interprets your search intent based on

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,860
your query they don't

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,210
clearly just look it up one-to-one

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,190
they're trying to figure out what you

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,530
mean if you have a movie called The Rock

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,170
about breaking into Alcatraz and you

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,700
have the rock Dwayne Johnson if you type

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,710
in the rock how does Google know which

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,390
of those results to serve you they're

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,250
making a guess by interpreting your

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,630
search intent we can think about that

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,810
search intent over the buying cycle

00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,460
starting with attraction where a need

00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,890
but from real life events meets

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,780
intentions and then consideration where

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,760
they're trying to think about how can I

00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,290
solve this problem and then preference

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,090
why should they trust you how are you

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,780
different from competitors and finally

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,740
conversion why buy from you now so how

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,230
do your keywords that you're targeting

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,520
group around these different content

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,490
pillars of you well these could be the

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,720
basis for a whole content strategy and

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:37,920
maybe these are even category names

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,920
within a blog let's talk about quality

00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,350
of content you got to focus on your text

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,090
so it's digestible so you can't have big

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,240
block walls of tests no one's gonna read

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:50,930
that break it up add images add media

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,040
add visual assets images diagrams

00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,990
infographics infographic an be a great

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,340
way to get backlinks to not to jump

00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,490
ahead but you can share those around the

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,130
web people love that stuff and of course

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,590
above all avoid duplicate content this

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,480
is a no brainer but wherever it is your

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,610
meta descriptions and your title tags on

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,290
your pages anywhere avoid it at all

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:16,320
costs Google hates it and post long

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:18,090
content I have an example here from last

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,420
year after the conference we posted this

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,310
one solidus comp 2018 recap and it's an

00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,200
incredibly long article I won't tell you

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:28,200
exactly how long it is but it's clearly

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,030
over 9,000 words and here we are

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,580
actually ranking just over the

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,660
conference website itself now who wants

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,550
to really go to the conference website

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,920
from last year but so this illustrates

00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,780
the idea that if you post long content

00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,320
that is one of the best things you can

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,360
do to help you rank should avoid generic

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,430
phrases as we talked about in the title

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,200
you want to avoid it in your headings

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,420
when you're in your content as well and

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,010
if you have any tiny little pages with

00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,030
just like 200 words get rid of those

00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,860
those don't matter

00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,740
they're probably hurting your overall

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,870
ratings and if you have to choose list

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,280
posts because these get the most links

00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,990
from

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,090
sites if you're looking for a format of

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:09,080
how to format your content this is one

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:11,990
of the best examples or maybe a list of

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,120
tips I don't know regularly update your

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:17,000
content keep it fresh like The Fresh

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,950
Prince of bel-air when you're updating

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,720
pages change more than just the date

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,680
Google can see how much you're changing

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,880
you want to make sure you're making

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,820
significant changes and if you have the

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,110
budget and resources make a podcast

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,820
podcasts are now directly indexed by

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,290
Google now really what we're trying to

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,970
do is build an audience so if you don't

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,620
have the resources I guess actually

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,060
isn't the way to go you might not even

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,290
want to get on social media maybe it's

00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,840
just building a newsletter and an

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:43,400
audience there but once you get to the

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,470
point where you're ready podcasts are a

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,260
great way to convert people

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,790
as you can see 25% of listeners have

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,070
bought product after listening to a

00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,980
podcast it's a really great resource for

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:57,170
original content today let's talk about

00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,830
writing though a little bit this tip 85

00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:03,020
has a lot in it let's just roll through

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,190
you want to plan a piece that has the

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,810
same things there's a little bit of

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,450
competitor analysis the same things that

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,400
the top five pieces have so do search

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,140
for your keyword and look at those sites

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,270
you don't have to analyze with some

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,340
special tool like look at each page and

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:19,160
try to see how it does the different

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,600
things that you want to do see if you

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,580
can make a page that meets search

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,190
intentions faster or more concisely than

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,810
those pages that you tell readers

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,940
exactly what their cover when maybe they

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,400
don't you can try writing for a lower

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,160
reading age than your competitors using

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,870
a clear structure and formatting giving

00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,460
clear definitions of key terms where

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,160
they don't that's an example of that

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,540
supplementary content expanding on the

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,310
topic as you progress through the piece

00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,990
in a way that they don't have some

00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,670
personality your rating to you know have

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,380
some tone you doesn't have to all be dry

00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:51,200
in scientific especially if it's not a

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,670
dry scientific site one of the most

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,740
important ones from here finding these

00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,540
primary sources it might be a little bit

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,820
tricky but figure out some primary

00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,100
source you can use solicit experts go on

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,990
the census data figure out somewhere you

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,330
can get primary sources take your own

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,700
photographs even this is a great way to

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,680
insert original content and you know

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,170
you're quoting these efforts to include

00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,190
social proof and at the end tell readers

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,440
what you're going to do next

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:18,190
leave them with a strong

00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,529
all the action you want to sprinkle in

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:24,269
longtail versions your keywords that's

00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:26,620
why that's up there I and you can target

00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:28,269
replacing an existing piece of content

00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:32,500
performing well say with up 10 ideas

00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:34,809
with a hundred tipping 88 you can add a

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,340
transcription of audio video this is

00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,960
really easy you can pay someone to do

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,269
this you have audio video sent right now

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,090
pay sonís transcribe it throw it up on

00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:44,350
your site include a sitemap again a

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,850
no-brainer most of you are probably

00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,490
already doing this but this helps your

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,320
set gets indexed faster include a link

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,669
table of contents so that people can

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,870
navigate around your say and then also

00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:54,730
so if someone's linking to your site

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,820
they can link right to that heading that

00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,740
piece of content that they want you can

00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,139
add internal links to your page this is

00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,519
another ranking factor you don't have to

00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:05,110
go overboard with it but each one of

00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,139
your pages should provide some pathway

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,399
to the other parts of your site and

00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:11,350
finally make sure that if you have any

00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:13,210
quotes you include them in quote boxes

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,009
don't just be lazy and put like a little

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,500
quote characters on make it look nice

00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:20,169
and make sure that you set an h1 tag

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,659
that's concise and use h2 tags for your

00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:24,549
subheadings we finally made it through

00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:26,500
original content let's talk about

00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:30,820
off-site promotion now we can do our

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,350
closing link acquisition link

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,879
acquisition really is just building

00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,919
backlinks to your site as they said

00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:39,389
these are recommendations from other

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,889
sites that you're a reputable source and

00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:43,779
if you can make sure that these are

00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:45,759
within the body of the page as high up

00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:48,759
on the page as possible that's a lot

00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,279
more effective than if they're somewhere

00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:53,340
else on the page like in the footer down

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,299
at the bottom like off to the side and

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,309
make sure if possible that they're

00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:59,620
diverse links none of this stuff about

00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:01,809
using private blog networks or anything

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,820
that from these weird sites you want to

00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,860
diverse link profile maybe some from

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:09,820
news source some from experts all around

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:11,559
the web we also want to make sure that

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,240
these links are properly attributed if

00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:16,120
your list especially if your listing

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,639
links on your site Google recently came

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,649
out with rel sponsored and rel UGC which

00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:21,909
is user-generated content you want to

00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:23,409
make sure that if you're including links

00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:24,940
in your site that are sponsored where

00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:27,559
you generated that they're marked

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,440
appropriately Google will like that

00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,970
and again don't buy links or spam

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,190
content boxes or stuffed keywords this

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,220
just doesn't work

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:38,840
consider using majestic citation flow to

00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,269
rank the quality of your backlinks

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,129
instead of domain Authority it's a

00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:46,820
better indication of how much search you

00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:49,370
still get from those backlinks simple

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,039
100 I especially love this is the Harrow

00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:54,200
method of building backlinks

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,570
it's called help a reporter out so you

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,100
can sign up for these emails they'll get

00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,210
placed in your inbox every day and

00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,799
they're looking for information on a

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,179
particular topic so you sign up saying

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,909
I'm an expert in this that and the other

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:07,129
thing they email asking if you're one of

00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:08,779
the first people to email back to answer

00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:10,460
the question you have a chance that

00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:12,559
you're going to get cited in whatever

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,669
that news or media article is so that

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,950
you can get a really high quality

00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:17,929
backlink one that maybe you wouldn't be

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,340
able to get otherwise by using this

00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:21,830
process it's a little bit of a lottery

00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:26,480
but it's another quality way that you

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:28,480
can build backlinks you also want to see

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,700
who's linking to your competitors and

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,350
it's more specifically what pages on

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,690
your competitors websites are they

00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,369
linking to just like we were talking

00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,049
about the SEO writing tips do a little

00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,840
analysis what's special about those

00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:44,360
pages what makes them the kind of pages

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,730
that other people want to link to and

00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,409
can you make a page on that topic can

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,869
you use that as an example to improve

00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:52,639
your own content possibly or maybe just

00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:54,830
as a topic idea of you don't have a page

00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:56,899
like that I'm now gonna make a page on

00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,610
whatever that thing is that I found for

00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:02,360
my competitor that's being so heavily

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:04,460
linked to we can also do link

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,960
reclamation for link building as well

00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,970
though it's not all about just building

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,029
kind of new links you can look around

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,679
the web using a tool like buzzsumo and

00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:14,480
find places where your name of your

00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,559
companies mentioned but nobody's linking

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,029
to you and you can email them and say

00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:19,610
hey would you mind giving me a link

00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:21,740
you're talking about my company you can

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,869
also use a tool like link miner to find

00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,999
broken links so places on the Internet

00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:27,610
where there's a link to something and if

00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:30,470
you click on it you get a four or four

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:33,470
well you can make a new piece of content

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,990
that's on that topic email the person

00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:38,059
that runs that website and try to get

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,649
your new content linked in place of that

00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:40,720
old one if they're fixing the link

00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:42,640
anyway

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,410
maybe the link to yours instead it's

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,150
possible they just end up fixing it and

00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,530
you know the URL had changed slightly

00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,480
and they point back to the original

00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:51,370
content but it's also possible that you

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,800
can take that link and that's a great

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:56,140
way and speaking of the last point

00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,080
infographics if you make a really great

00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,970
infographic or images you should use

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,680
Google's reversed search see if they're

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,480
on the web somewhere they might be

00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,550
listed already on some actually pretty

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,410
high ranking domains that you could get

00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:10,510
great search juice from if you just

00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,250
emailed them and said hey by the way

00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:16,210
you're using my infographic would you

00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:19,690
mind giving us a link ranking in local

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,770
search local search obviously is more

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,140
important if you have a brick and mortar

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:26,560
but I think it can have an impact for

00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,690
any site if done right you can start by

00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,760
executing an outreach campaign to local

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,990
businesses this is an organic outreach

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,850
campaign this is not something online

00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,980
you'd even visit those businesses in

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:38,560
person and try to make friends with

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,970
those owners make a new friend and then

00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,740
the other side of this besides that

00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:44,500
organic outreach is building a citation

00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,110
Network you can do these directly

00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,270
yourself manually you can pay someone to

00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:51,040
enter them manually or you can submit

00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,900
them to aggregators but the bottom line

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,540
is you want your business listed online

00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,160
in all the different directories Google

00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,690
will see that and they will like that

00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,340
and give you a boost you need to make

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,080
sure though that all the information is

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,880
consistent you don't want any situation

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,810
where there's an address here and it's a

00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,980
little bit different this phone number

00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:09,030
here and this different phone number

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,380
there Google will penalize you for that

00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,720
probably the most important thing go

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,970
local search is claiming Google my

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,680
business profile if you've not claimed

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,090
this you must claim this this is one of

00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,600
the most important tips from the talk

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:24,940
it's more focused on local but it's very

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,470
very important it's the best and biggest

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,830
low-hanging fruit you can take if you

00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:31,450
haven't done it yet so finally we move

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,120
on to social media our last off-site

00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:36,190
promotion this may seem obvious but

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,770
create a Facebook Twitter and Instagram

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,360
account and build your brand's it's been

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,060
shown that accounts that have more

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,760
engagement like shares follows these are

00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,550
count these are websites that link

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,620
better that rank better in search now

00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,760
it's true the links on social media

00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,890
don't direct

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,900
impact your ranking but Google does pay

00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,790
attention how many people are posting

00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,260
and sharing different links and if

00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,450
there's something that is being posted

00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,130
widely you'll get a boost from that even

00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:06,250
if you're not getting a boost say from a

00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:08,530
backlink from that social site and while

00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,940
you're on it why not create a official

00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,730
LinkedIn company page that's another

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,500
easy one how many of you don't have one

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,880
of those pages yet if you don't create

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,960
one it won't take very long at all so

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,550
now we're kind of getting into talking

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,870
about interaction and how we improve

00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,970
interaction and ultimately build a

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,320
following you need to add prominent

00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,540
social media shares to your website

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,700
buttons to share if you don't have any

00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,620
buttons nobody's really gonna share I

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,630
mean occasionally people will take your

00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,360
link and post it themselves but if you

00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:39,460
have fun this is click to share that's

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,010
golden and maybe you could do that

00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,330
directly from within your content you

00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,340
don't have to have a separate little

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,660
widget only in your footer with a button

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,280
that says Facebook and you click it you

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,650
share you could be writing an article

00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,230
and midway down have a button that says

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,910
share the tip that you just read so that

00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,800
if someone really loved that tip they're

00:29:54,910 --> 00:30:02,050
sharing that tip right away prefilled

00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,070
out if you don't have enough time and I

00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,510
was talking about this earlier with the

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,150
podcast and you can't focus on

00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:09,220
everything focus on Facebook and Twitter

00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:12,130
these are the ones that Google pays most

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,010
attention to and if you need to kind of

00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,780
narrow down your audience search this is

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,820
probably the best way you can do it and

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,800
if you make posts about things like

00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,020
king-size mattress well then guess what

00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:27,010
you're gonna rank better for searches

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:29,290
like king-size mattress and how do you

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,120
build up following other than this again

00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,730
there's no magic bullet you keep your

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,220
profile up to date you post regularly

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,720
with engaging compelling content that

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,460
people want to read they want to visit

00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,070
your profile to check that thing out and

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:45,070
this can cause valuable opportunities

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,630
and partnerships perhaps just a forum

00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,040
kind of organically just because people

00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,900
really like whatever it is that you're

00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,090
doing and speaking of which we can also

00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,220
seek out those influencers either

00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:56,110
organic influences or paid influencers

00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,940
and try to get them to promote our brand

00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:00,460
in a way that feels very authentic

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,040
lending their own expertise

00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,070
authoritative Ness and Trust to your

00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,490
brands

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:11,170
so in closing we have a hundred and one

00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:15,040
tips here actually it's more than 101

00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:16,960
how many we get to 114 ok I know it's a

00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,150
lot so you might not want to do it all

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,880
yourself you might want to consider

00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:23,500
hiring a CEO but what are some questions

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,110
you could ask you might not really know

00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,300
where to start first question is do they

00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,890
guarantee results if they do they're

00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,080
probably not worth anything because

00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,970
nobody can guarantee results in SEO

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,010
are they transparent about their

00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,440
strategies you can see I've demystified

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,060
it it's not some black box they can tell

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,160
you what your what they are going to do

00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,810
for you on a regular basis if they tell

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,700
you oh we can't provide access to the

00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:48,190
analytics or whatever the data is I'm

00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,260
sorry that's a bad sign another bad sign

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,840
did they use private blog networks or

00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,610
other shady black hat techniques these

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,530
increasingly do not work and

00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,970
increasingly are penalized and in the

00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,470
future I think we'll be penalized even

00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,120
heavier those are the indication that

00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:03,340
Google has been giving us lately and

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,800
finally have they ever attended or

00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,810
participated or given talks on any SEO

00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,850
topics in any conferences if this

00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:12,160
company's worth something maybe you can

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,140
go on and find a talk on how they are

00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,600
worth something

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,490
so from here there's one other thing

00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:22,000
that we can do besides doing in ourself

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:24,310
and hiring someone we could leverage the

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,460
work in the community so we're proud to

00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,810
announce the release of solidus SEO this

00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,240
is now listening on the extensions page

00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:34,120
and this does some of this too for you

00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,190
it doesn't do nearly all of it but it

00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,560
does help you optimize your images let's

00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,570
assume we use paperclip it does give you

00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,310
better metadata defaults and a to SEO

00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,700
interface to spit out more of that

00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:52,240
metadata and it does add json-ld

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:54,850
structured data isn't it great when

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,560
you're we didn't get free work from the

00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:59,560
community like this that you can

00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,240
leverage in your own project I think

00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,510
that's fantastic that's one of the

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:10,060
things that draws me to solidus this is

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:13,000
the power of open source solidus is open

00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,910
source so let's talk about this for

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,800
saying what is solidest give you

00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:22,300
complete control over your store

00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:25,720
no licensing fee a strong community and

00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:28,360
an even stronger core support for

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,910
high-volume stores with varied and

00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,890
complex knees and in fact many out line

00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:34,840
use cases and specific features have

00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:38,890
already been included in our platform we

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:41,020
all know this so wouldn't it be great to

00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:47,440
leverage even more Community Supported

00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:49,450
work and how you might ask use open

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,970
collective funding to hire a full time

00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:54,910
open-source maintainer who would work

00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:58,330
with and at the direction of the core

00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:03,100
team and the ambassador's to implement

00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:05,050
our new project roadmap we need a

00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:08,050
roadmap we need to implement new

00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:10,600
features and I cannot tell you how happy

00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:14,530
I am that we are all here today to work

00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,899
together and to make that a reality with

00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:19,750
a full-time maintainer working on the

00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:25,889
code we can make commitments and even if

00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:28,810
we don't meet all of them I am a warrior

00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:31,629
and even if we don't meet all of those

00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:34,060
commitments trying is enough trying is

00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:35,619
better than not doing it having any road

00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,179
map and doing none of it is better than

00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:39,040
not saying anything and giving the

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,020
community no direction we need to have a

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,030
road map we need to keep this platform

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,980
current and that's what we're gonna get

00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:47,470
with that full-time maintainer we're

00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:50,230
gonna save money all of us cutting down

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:52,720
on development time and costs helping to

00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:56,379
deliver projects in a shorter amount of

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,180
time but what else are you not convinced

00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:00,010
yet are you not convinced that we need a

00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,990
full-time maintainer and we can do it as

00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,480
a community we can make our customers

00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:07,290
happier with the finished products by

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,660
providing more features and better UX

00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:12,580
ultimately making more money

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:14,590
how many attract users to solidus so it

00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,109
will continue to grow so we can increase

00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:21,460
our adoption rates and thrive in the

00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:24,570
future helping to keep solidus and its

00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:27,460
community vibrant and strong together

00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:30,510
and what does this all really mean when

00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,510
you put it all together

00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:36,420
your business more profitable with less

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,000
effort that's what a full-time

00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,830
maintainer brings to the platform it's

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,530
not that as a community we can't do a

00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:45,630
ton without it we can we've shown that

00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:48,240
over the last year and previous to that

00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:51,030
as well but bringing on a full-time

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,850
maintainer this would be different this

00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:58,410
would be more profit with less effort so

00:35:53,850 --> 00:36:00,240
how support solidus I'm asking from each

00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,860
one of you here today that cared enough

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,510
to come to this conference and each one

00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,580
of you online watching this talk

00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:07,980
whenever you do to make a pledge to

00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,530
support solidus we can do that in a

00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,970
number of different ways the first way

00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:15,000
and the way that we've just been talking

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:18,060
about is money we can have a $750

00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,500
contribution from each company that can

00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,510
afford to make that kind of contribution

00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,540
who can really afford to make it I don't

00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,610
know if your budgets a $150,000 a year

00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,370
in development that's only six percent

00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,410
of your budget at $750 or if it was

00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:34,440
$300,000 for your budget only be three

00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:36,360
percent of your budget so we are talking

00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,310
about larger companies but if you're an

00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,500
agency that's making money from this

00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:42,960
platform or if you're a big retail shop

00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,880
we need your help and the first way is

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,070
with money of course we could talk about

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,870
lower contribution tiers but what we

00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,640
really need are contributors at this

00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,680
ambassador level so that we can quickly

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,830
get to the point where we can afford a

00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,780
yearly salary for a full-time maintainer

00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:00,270
the second way was code you can sponsor

00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,010
open source Fridays at your company this

00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,260
is something that was initiated by

00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:05,880
github and it doesn't have to be every

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,830
Friday it could be every Friday but it

00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,420
scales it could be just one Friday a

00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:11,340
month it could be just one Friday a

00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,900
quarter that you as a company commit to

00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,880
saying okay we're all gonna work on

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,200
solidus or the project of your choice

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,750
but obviously we're talking about

00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,310
solidus here and finally if you can't do

00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,720
that if you can't find company time or

00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:24,330
money maybe you can find some of your

00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,460
own time and organize a meet-up just

00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,960
once per quarter and if you're not sure

00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,670
how to do that if where is a community

00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,860
not sure exactly how to do that we can

00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,570
look to Oktoberfest from digital auction

00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,940
as an example they have a great event

00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:38,850
kit that outlines everything you need to

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,170
host a great event so let's get a

00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,140
commitment from everybody in this room

00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,530
to host an event once a quarter or to

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,020
participate in open source for

00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:49,180
or to contribute - amount and if you

00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,310
can't do any of that maybe you can join

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,320
the solidus stakeholders chat and

00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,090
participate in our regular meetings and

00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,250
you might be asking yourself what is

00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,930
that and I'll explain in a moment but

00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,120
first I want to say a special thank you

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,370
to the ambassadors they're already

00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,230
contributing today leading through their

00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:08,020
example I'm proud to say karma is one of

00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:09,970
those but moded euros I have to

00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:12,310
especially call out and thanked because

00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,440
this is the first retail shop that came

00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:17,230
on to say ok we're gonna step up the

00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,390
plate and show everybody that it's

00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,940
important even if you work in retail to

00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:24,820
contribute back to this platform we need

00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:27,010
nine more ambassadors by my count to pay

00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:30,010
a salary of around 120 thousand dollars

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,870
a year to developer we could maybe have

00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,890
more and paying more or less and find

00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,570
someone that it's willing to do it for

00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,920
less what we essentially need now more

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:38,650
companies willing to step up to the

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,020
plate so I want to ask for a big THANK

00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,310
YOU to these five companies but also to

00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,680
all the rest of you because there's been

00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,300
a lot of other monthly donors either

00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,940
individuals or companies donating a

00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,550
lower amount so thank you very much for

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,800
your hard work and help you might be

00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,290
thinking well that's all well and good I

00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,990
like a full-time maintainer but that's

00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,760
not enough well you get more if you sign

00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,140
up as an ambassador you get all this

00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,300
stuff it's listed on our website

00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,400
you can and I think this is the first

00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,410
and most important point that's why it's

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,020
first you can actively shape the

00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,670
direction and strategy of solidus so if

00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,710
your store that cares about where the

00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,110
platform is going donate the solidus

00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,340
will make sure that we do something

00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,230
along the lines of what you want to do

00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,540
will be everything maybe not but as a

00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,090
community we can decide together if our

00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,350
stakeholders step up and speaking of

00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,150
community you'll also appear in the

00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,400
community section our website you'll get

00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:33,100
your logo on conference material you'll

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,020
be recognized in the readme you'll be

00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,730
mentioned during conferences and you'll

00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,170
have the option I suppose if you're an

00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,090
agency this will only be applicable to

00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:44,140
join our partnership program as a Gold

00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:46,840
Partner you may be asking yourself now

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,790
at this point how did we get this far

00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,230
how did we do all of this over the last

00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:55,000
year the process has been a bit opaque

00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,620
Sean Denny is going to explain to all of

00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,590
you tomorrow

00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,000
a lot more

00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,620
about what's happened over that last

00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,560
year so don't want to spoil too much

00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:05,900
event but suffice it to say that a lot

00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,120
has gone on ever since Sean organised

00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,950
southeast solidus last year and brought

00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,990
us together and stem bolt broke the news

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,110
that they required by Jul our community

00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,070
has been working trying to reorganize

00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:18,350
there's been people working behind the

00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,000
scenes the first thing is just a slack

00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,500
channel that we've been all talking in

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,180
the second thing is that we've been

00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,460
holding bi-weekly meetings over the

00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,450
course the last year but coming up to

00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,270
the conference we felt that wasn't

00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:31,610
enough so we started hosting meetings

00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,950
twice a week every week it seemed like

00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:35,650
quite a big increase in frequency but

00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:38,120
it's what we needed to do to get it done

00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,410
and we did get it done and you know

00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,870
speaking of which we organized this

00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:43,580
conference we lined up the speakers we

00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,260
had a fantastic speaker dinner last

00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,920
night where we're actually talking about

00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:50,510
real issues we also opened open

00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,340
collective and and started funding

00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,980
through it and most importantly of all

00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,960
we built trust and relationships that

00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,940
let us move forward together because

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,590
without trust there's no way for us to

00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,480
have an honest conversation about the

00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:07,490
direction the platform or implementing a

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:09,080
new roadmap or any event so you may have

00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:11,780
noticed that I'm wearing a shirt today

00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,340
that says support solidus a few other

00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,740
people in the audience are as well and

00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:19,310
some aren't wearing it but if you're a

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,900
speaker if you're a core member or if

00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,120
you're an ambassador or even just

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,310
someone who loves this platform and has

00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,460
contributed over this last year with

00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:30,470
even a single commit that got merged in

00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:32,570
then you deserve a big round of applause

00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:34,670
and I'd like to ask each one of you

00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:37,040
before we do that to find one of these

00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,650
people go find them go say thank you if

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,540
you're benefiting from this platform go

00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,700
say thank you to one of the people one

00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:46,700
of the core members that made this a

00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:48,200
reality this year so can I ask the

00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,330
people wearing the shirts and anybody

00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,900
that's a core member to stand up for a

00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,900
round of applause

00:41:53,710 --> 00:42:03,070
[Applause]

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,070
[Music]

00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:08,690
and that's it for my talk everybody

00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,880
support solidus with your code by

00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:14,270
becoming an ambassador or by going into

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,720
your time together we can do this we'll

00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:20,300
have a meeting on Wednesday and Shawn

00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,970
will tell you more but I encourage all

00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:25,580
of you to find a new way to participate

00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:26,820
and to support the platform thank you

00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:31,510

00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:44,800
[Applause]

00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:44,800
