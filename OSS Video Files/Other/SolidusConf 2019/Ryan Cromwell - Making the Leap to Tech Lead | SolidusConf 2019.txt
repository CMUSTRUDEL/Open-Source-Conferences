[Music]

00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:17,190
this is my first time and in Salt Lake

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,770
in Utah I it's beautiful out there I get

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,830
a chance to travel all over the country

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,960
I don't do quite as much as I used to

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,090
but it's awesome out there so what a

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,859
what an awesome place this is I can't

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,160
wait to come back again for all those

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,230
folks that are Rob Sean I've heard a

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,300
handful of other names that put this

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,550
conference on all the sponsors thank you

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,110
so much this is a lot of fun I'm excited

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,260
to be out here and hang out with you all

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,879
for a couple of days before we get

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,039
started I'm kind of curious I this is a

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,170
new audience for me I I don't know a

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,820
whole lot about solidus as a product in

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,890
a platform so I've I've appreciated

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,480
everything everybody's told me today and

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,680
last night at the speaker dinner about

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,930
the platform it seems really cool the

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,510
community seems pretty awesome but I if

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,180
I can get like a hand or two who hears

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,670
would consider themselves like a tech

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,020
lead today something like that maybe do

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,430
architecture or things along that line

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,900
I'd say anybody who's like a core team

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,360
member I would say you know you're

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,979
definitely a tech lead how about just

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,299
you know there you're a developer you've

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,890
been doing this for a little while raise

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,640
your hand if you're in the development

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,670
space how about like program product

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,600
management maybe program or project

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:31,380
manager anybody in that realm cool who

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,970
here would call themselves a leader

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,119
that's like it's a trick question

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,200
actually you're all leaders so but

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,220
that's okay that's that's what we're

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,890
going to talk a little bit about today

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,229
so um I worked for a software

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,049
development agency what we mentioned

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,490
that's primarily in the Midwest area

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,070
we've got folks all the way up to

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,479
Colorado and Vermont but mostly in in

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,250
that Pittsburgh Ohio Pennsylvania area

00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,850
where how our home base is in Dayton

00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,399
Ohio

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,280
like a growing metropolis it's about a

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,979
third the size of Salt Lake so it's you

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,660
know it's fun to be there but I when I

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:11,850
first joined spark box this was six

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,350
maybe seven years ago now probably seven

00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,239
years ago now I'd have a conversation

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,920
with one of my good friends up there his

00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,600
name's Rob Harr he's our Vice President

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:24,810
and Rob and I would talk about what it

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,150
meant to grow this smaller team that we

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,670
had at the time about seven maybe eight

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,590
developers and grow their leadership

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,049
skills grow them and give them new

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:38,400
experiences now Rob and I had a

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:41,850
background in consulting ok so he and I

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,230
would jump from client to client I mean

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,450
work together

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,100
learn about new businesses we kind of

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,030
had to learn I think on our feet figure

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,489
things out as we went along

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,040
navigate new personalities new technical

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,230
stacks you know I was in the dotnet

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
space for the most part I actually loved

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,500
it I'm not I don't really feel like I'm

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,959
recovering I enjoyed it quite a bit I

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,299
learned quite a bit but we'd have this

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,480
conversation and we knew that it was the

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:08,549
variety that helped us grow right it was

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,799
jumping from client to client and

00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,900
exploring new worlds and learning from

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,660
those it led to us learning quite a bit

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,310
quite fast and we were trying to figure

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,739
out how do we how do we help this team

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,380
that we knew had to grow right we're

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,640
about 50 folks now how do we help them

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,799
get those experiences because they're

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,630
really talented how do we help them grow

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,000
into the leaders that we need them to be

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,120
as we grow the company okay and so I've

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,090
spent about six years now working on

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,650
that problem helping us grow to about 50

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,790
before that I was you know architect

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,380
tech lead on a number of different

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,519
projects so I knew how to do it myself

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,169
but I didn't know how to help other

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,150
people necessarily grow into that role

00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,430
and that's what I want to talk about

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,230
I want to share with you in my mind and

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,700
our and spark box is mine what a tech

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,819
lead looks like what that role looks

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,739
like I want to talk about also what it

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,879
looks like to grow folks and grow

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:02,370
yourselves into that role so as you can

00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,870
I got to put a big disclaimer over the

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,459
top of this thing and you can probably

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,640
already tell like this is this is

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,769
heavily bent and heavily framed by spark

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,269
box our business which is client

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,920
services building software for other

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,930
companies a lot of it is in the retail

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,459
e-commerce space but it's all over the

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,780
map we work with startups we work with

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,919
energy and energy industry quite a bit

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,380
but it's definitely you know leans

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,050
towards those it also is heavily lean

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,210
toward bent towards the culture that

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,090
we've worked really hard to develop over

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,440
the last 10 years or so certainly last

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,710
six or seven years while I've been there

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,260
and then finally you know my history you

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,310
know is a big part of all of this

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,870
because it's really it's what I know

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,220
and while I do lean on a lot of other

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,830
people are both in our organization and

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,509
outside to learn you know my history my

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,840
background comes into play for a lot of

00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:53,550
this stuff as we as we leave this talk

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,050
and we get to have chance to hang out

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,060
maybe over lunch and this evening I'm

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,500
super interested all of those folks who

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,720
have kind of put their hand up to say

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,520
you know I've been a leader you know I'm

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,380
a tech lead core members I'm super

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,180
interested in that I had a chance to

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,740
talk with a few for at least one core

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,330
member last night and I was super

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,220
curious what does it mean to be a core

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,620
member on an open-source product that's

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,360
pretty different than what we do but I'm

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,470
super interested to hear what how these

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,180
things resonate with all of you ok so

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,270
let's start with just kind of at a

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,780
high-level abstract perspective what is

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,310
a tech lead ok and for us you know the

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,650
first thing is is that tech lead as a

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,690
partner specifically a partner with what

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,280
we'll call a project manager now now you

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,599
may not have a project manager and

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,430
that's ok you may not have somebody

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:39,840
called a project manager but I guarantee

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,760
you there's somebody who cares about the

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,260
investment that's being made into the

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,490
work that's going into a project or an

00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,320
initiative or something like that

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,280
as well as the outcomes for that like

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,830
what are they gonna get for their

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,210
investment and and for us you know we're

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,590
working with a lot of companies a lot of

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,990
clients that don't know what it means to

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,130
build software all right and so when

00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,330
they're when they're doing that we have

00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,100
a project manager there to kind of

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,630
Shepherd them along help them understand

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,210
it's important what the process looks

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,980
like help them feel in control of this

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,510
process feel like they're a part of the

00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,600
process that's important to us at spark

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,760
box and as a tech lead what we're asking

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,560
of you is to be kind of a partner with

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,690
that project manager to help make that

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,190
move along right to weigh options

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,510
because there's always options

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,240
there's always decisions to be made

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,620
right to understand what the state of

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,270
the project isn't it's a surface that

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,340
state of the project to the people that

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,960
care about it whether that's the client

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,390
for in our case whether that's the

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,340
community in this case or other partners

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,110
the ambassadors as a good example as

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,040
well as to look at what like the next

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,390
step so you take some of that

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,340
information and you're looking for the

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,650
next steps and making decisions about

00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,940
how we're gonna use that investment over

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,560
the next couple of weeks a couple of

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,780
months whatever that might look like and

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,400
that's that's the biggest part of the

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,280
partnership effort that these folks are

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,600
going to go through a tech leads role

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,400
changes when you're an individual

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,900
contributor your goal is to make sure

00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,090
that the things that you own the things

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,590
in your purview are moving maybe across

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,570
the board if you're using something like

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,790
Kanban or scrum like you're focused in

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,290
on features and you may be collaborating

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,790
to some degree on what the overall

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,920
architecture looks like with other folks

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,840
but a lot of times you're kind of narrow

00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,150
you get to go kind of narrow on a on a

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,850
product or a scope of an overall product

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,470
or project or suite or portfolio of

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,780
applications when you're when you're a

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,640
tech lead you you you change what your

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,260
goal is what your outcomes success

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,520
outcomes look like and you start to be

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,980
measured by the success of the team

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,040
right the success of the project that's

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,650
really important mindset to change and

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,440
you'll find that this can be kind of a

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,240
trap too sometimes because where you

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,710
used to just hammer down and be a great

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,640
developer moving cards across the board

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,230
you were really fast

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,640
remember you're you're a successful

00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,930
developer you've been doing this a while

00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,910
you've shipped some software that works

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,530
the people like and now it's your

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,840
opportunity to help other people do that

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,200
and the same things that you used to put

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,730
in the same tech techniques and skills

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,920
that you have don't always apply

00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,440
wholesale to a project you can't just

00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,570
bear down and try to get more code out

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,280
your goal is to work with the team and

00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:06,000
enable the team and that's a big

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,729
important difference here in order to do

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,780
that as a tech lead your responsibility

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,250
is to make sure other people know what's

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,870
going on and know where our vision is

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,300
because when you're zoomed in

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,530
a problem and you've probably done this

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,390
let's just take a really contrived

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,060
example when you're working on let's say

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,160
in rails or in Ruby on a controller

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,930
action or a model or something like that

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,310
and you're focused down in there you

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,200
sometimes lose sight of the overall

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,850
picture right it's easy to do those

00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,640
kinds of things and that ability to zoom

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,830
in but also zoom out on a project is

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,110
really important and it is something

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:40,170
that I think is learned right it takes

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,550
some experience it takes some time many

00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,620
people just you know fall into it

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,840
naturally but it's also something that I

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,610
think in my mind you can practice by by

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,770
taking moments scheduling sometime

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,150
honestly on your calendar to learn these

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,740
things but you need to be able to

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,170
describe this and convey this to folks

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,870
on a regular basis but it also means you

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,580
have to have a vision right and I've

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,220
heard a lot of talk here this weekend

00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,790
about what the vision is what the future

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,930
looks like for the solidus platform

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,800
that's an important thing to have and

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,810
it's important for everybody to

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,550
understand it so when I hear about core

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,190
team members when I hear about Wednesday

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,510
I hear about similar topics of creating

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,890
a vision for what this platform looks

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,320
like so that the rest of the community

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,180
the ambassadors those people who are

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,620
joining open-source Fridays have an

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,030
opportunity to contribute and do it

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,680
effectively because one of the worst

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,110
things you can do as a maker is to

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,460
contribute something and not see it used

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,080
so having a vision that's appropriate

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,960
doing being able to do things right to

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,850
step in and do things that fit the

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,890
vision is really important and that's on

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,690
you isit's heckley and that takes

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,560
practice takes time you're gonna be

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,700
doing a lot of different things and

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,830
we'll talk about some of the techniques

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,190
that I think are really important that

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:49,320
we we use at spark box this talk

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,060
actually is kind of a like yanked out of

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,820
and a condensed version of a workshop

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,710
that we do at spark box that we built to

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,480
train our own employees it's an all-day

00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,070
workshop called build right sustainable

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,270
software it's it's build right as a

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,070
series of workshops that we do but

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,810
sustainable software is really the one

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,520
we built and and we like to go out and

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,320
teach folks that's a big part of what we

00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,660
do so we've taken this workshop that we

00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,220
built to help our own team grow and we

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,170
go out and we do things like this right

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,400
we talked to folks we do this workshop

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,980
we've done it in Pittsburgh we're gonna

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,960
do it in Cleveland we've done it a

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,130
handful of other places as well but

00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,480
that's something that we think is really

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,030
important we talk about some of those

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,790
techniques to help describe and create

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:31,920
vision for a team that needs to complete

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:34,530
consume it and build within it so as as

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,590
you're helping enable a team to work and

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,220
your your your going into the problem of

00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,780
delivery

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,340
maybe that's over that couple of days a

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,720
couple of weeks whatever and then

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,550
zooming out to talk about the vision

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,840
right and understand the vision and

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,390
figure out what the plans for the next

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,120
steps are you have a responsibility to

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:54,810
start to model what it looks like when

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,000
when you're for better or worse when you

00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:00,450
are given a title and it has the word

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,620
lead in it your actions way more okay

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,390
and I know that we want to be open to

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,340
everybody being leaders and things like

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:12,150
that but there's just this seems to be

00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,520
this innate habit of us to to look at

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,080
folks who have the role of leader who

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,150
express those things who are coming to

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,310
us with these leadership qualities

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,530
traits responsibilities and we watch

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,090
what they do and we tend to model it and

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,670
so it's ever more important it's it's

00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:30,020
it's exponentially more important that

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,220
you retain the discipline and the

00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,740
wherewithal to model the behaviors that

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,410
you want to see okay and that will that

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,670
will show up later on down the line

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,470
towards the end of this where it becomes

00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,570
essentially especially important for our

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,310
for our tech leads to model this

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,020
behavior so that's things like if you

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,880
have an expectation that you you always

00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,810
submit a PR before you emerge to master

00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,520
something silly like that

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,280
like we're talking about get github

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,900
bitbucket whatever you don't get to

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,980
pretend because you're now tech lead

00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,080
that you get to just kind of shove

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,120
things in there and avoid reviews right

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,440
you don't get to avoid it and pawn

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,480
things off that maybe you don't like to

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,180
do like testing or something like that

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,920
off to other folks it's your turn to

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,680
explain things really well provide

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,140
context describe things really well

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,850
that's important and especially and more

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,350
especially important for tech leads to

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,720
do because they're gonna hope to see

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,150
those things I can't describe for you

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,790
what it means what how it works how we

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:25,650
work together means for your company we

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,270
publish ours the the link down there at

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,310
the bottom I've got the slides out there

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,590
that I can share or publish if you want

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,480
but we've published what ours looks like

00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,680
and this describes across a couple of

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,510
different facets in our organization

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,010
what it means to work together and it's

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,690
ever evolving like it changes and it's

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,410
different between different teams and

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,000
things along that

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,920
but like the core responsibilities

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,980
expectations that we have for folks on

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,709
our team live right there okay some

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,240
examples if you're in slack and you're

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:52,740
given a response to somebody if you're

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,990
in a pull request and you're giving a

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,149
code review or recommendations we expect

00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:00,500
thoughtful responses we don't expect

00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:04,110
Curt hey we should do this instead right

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,819
another example of that is for our team

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,519
we have an expectation that you're going

00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:09,600
to give kudos inside of PRS probably

00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,939
about the same amount that you're gonna

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,290
ask hey what about doing it this way

00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:14,939
right that you're gonna offer up

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,350
suggestions ask questions things like

00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:17,759
just as much as your and you're gonna

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,290
you're gonna pray is what you see in

00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,480
there especially if somebody's doing

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,319
something new because of the work that

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,550
you've mentored them in accomplishing

00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:28,769
you're gonna leave projects better than

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,480
you found them right for us that's

00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:31,889
things like build and deploy pipelines

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,319
which I'm really excited to hear about

00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,670
later this afternoon taking solidus from

00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:37,740
development to production I think that's

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,730
that's near and dear to my heart and

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,889
we're gonna talk some more about that

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,509
here in a little bit so those are some

00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:44,100
of the examples of things that are are

00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:45,509
defining how we work and we're pretty

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,189
explicit about it and that's important

00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:48,870
because we're remote we have people all

00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:50,639
over the place we're bringing new folks

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,899
in we want them to be able to understand

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,740
what it what does it look like to work

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:58,199
on a on a spark box project alright now

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,420
this one excuse me this one kind of

00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,759
wraps it all together this run really in

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,170
my mind sets the stage or sets the

00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,089
expectation for what it means to be a

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,329
tech lead and that's their primary role

00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:11,339
is to empower to support to lift up the

00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,779
rest of the team to put people in a

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,250
position to be successful and we talked

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,779
about that a little bit earlier by by

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,199
spreading the vision now there's an

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:21,329
awful lot of ways to do this if you talk

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,309
to half a dozen developed a cleans here

00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,839
folks who have filled that role leaders

00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:26,490
in general what it means to empower

00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,600
people how do you go about doing all of

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,399
these things that I've just talking

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,949
talked about these abstract level things

00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:36,029
they probably have a pretty diverse set

00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:38,279
of responsibilities now we break this

00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:41,040
apart about break some of the skills

00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,750
some of the traits competencies if you

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,430
will

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,019
experiences that we're looking for in a

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,180
tech Lea but also trying to create and

00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,740
tech leads across five categories and

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,329
we'll talk about that here in a second

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,399
the categories themselves aren't super

00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,820
interesting really the content in them

00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,350
but it

00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,500
helps provide you know some bundles

00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:00,930
there for people to learn and focus on

00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,610
is they they develop a career path okay

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,610
the first one is is you got to be kind

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,620
of good at what you do right you can't

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,260
show up and not have have had any

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,700
experience delivering software we need

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,370
you to be we need you to be pretty good

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,530
at at least one core area of the

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,330
software that we build right and for us

00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,950
as the client services that that spans a

00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,660
lot of different text acts so we're

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,550
gonna hit like laravel we're gonna hit

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,010
rails we're gonna hit a lot of a lot of

00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,800
JavaScript stuff node front-end react

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:31,560
view all the things right so it's pretty

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,960
broad but we need you to probably be a

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,880
go-to expert in one area of the code

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,820
base now that that can also be a trap

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,800
right because then all of a sudden you

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,630
become capable of delivering features

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,070
and and you got to balance that and

00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,650
we'll talk a little bit more about that

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:50,250
for me just as a quick anecdote that's

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,750
probably like API design designs design

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,080
patterns software design patterns

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,580
architecture integrations data contract

00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,590
modeling that's where I feel comfortable

00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,390
if we've got a system where there's a

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:04,140
lot of that going on I can help out a

00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:05,820
lot right I feel comfortable if it's you

00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,550
know HTML CSS we're building a design

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,120
system or pattern library or or what

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,130
have you

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,830
we've got great people for that right

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:17,280
I'm not going to be that tech lead even

00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,140
even today if it's you know react and

00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,450
view and things along that line I do I

00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,620
do pretty well but we have a lot of

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,060
folks that are really good at that and

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,130
if if we have a project that's heavy

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,630
react I've heard some really neat

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,310
stories about some projects that folks

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,470
have going on here using things like

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,690
create rack tap I would expect you to be

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,750
pretty good at that okay because you're

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,770
gonna be looking for opportunities to to

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,030
enable other team members you're

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,440
probably going to be mentoring a little

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,030
bit you need to know how those pieces

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,790
work together so that's it that's

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:47,250
important it also means you're probably

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,990
gonna be the the go-to person or a

00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,370
really good person to help debug some of

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,740
the hairiest problems that you run into

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,850
right the team is going to get blocked

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,950
at some point and they're gonna look to

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,070
you and it's helpful for you to have had

00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,020
the experience of trudging through nasty

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:04,740
software debugging really weird things

00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,610
with with HTTP requests you know looking

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,559
at load balancers debugging things

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,179
installing a PM tools all that kind of

00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:14,179
stuff like that's you're gonna get

00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:16,010
called in to do that but of course that

00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:17,420
can be a trap as well because if you're

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,250
not mentoring and teaching those folks

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:31,730
you're gonna be in a you know world I

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:33,590
heard sorry one of the ways that you can

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:38,059
support folks one of the ways that you

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,830
can lift up enable to become leaders on

00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:41,900
their own right

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:45,350
is to put them in a position to be

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,850
successful when when we're looking at at

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,980
where a tech lead fits in from a

00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,330
technical perspective one of the things

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,240
that we're looking for them to do is

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,280
find seems in a system seems in your

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,380
architecture now that's that's a term

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,299
that I don't I don't know is is super

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,309
well-known in the system I think it's it

00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:03,260
may be something that we've we've talked

00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,910
about well what these are these are

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,150
often like described as interfaces

00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,770
between different things it could be you

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,390
know the way you decide to model your

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,570
component structure if you're in a react

00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,740
app maybe this is the way that that one

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,140
part of the system integrates with

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,150
another the way that you the way that

00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,720
you interact with your database you know

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,669
those are those are those are the

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,679
logical boundaries between parts of your

00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,120
system and we're looking for seams in

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,840
the system because it allows folks to

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,030
kind of fan out start doing work making

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,220
their own decisions which is really

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:40,400
important to creating new leaders right

00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,290
to enabling folks to being a delegator

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,450
so we create systems allowing people to

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,580
go to work and now all of a sudden our

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,410
world changes our responsibility is a

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,540
tech leave once folks are able to go and

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,980
work on their own and kind of build

00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,570
things out maybe it's multiple teams

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,700
maybe it's individual members on teams

00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,960
maybe they're pairing on things but what

00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,669
we want to do next is find a way to

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,130
create some feedback loops because the

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:02,690
what you just created as a tech lis it

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,700
is actually one of your your biggest

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,020
downfalls when you create seams you

00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,450
allow people to go and kind of work

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,919
independently you've created risk and

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,890
that risk is built into assumptions

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,890
right we've planned out some work but we

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:17,480
have no idea if that's going to work we

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,559
have we've planned out how two systems

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,570
two parts of a system are going to

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,660
integrate we have no idea whether or not

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,640
that's going to be success

00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,680
and functional when the two teams to

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,390
come together so now it's my turn as a

00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,290
tech lead to find as many opportunities

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:33,570
for those team members to collaborate

00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:36,000
that's through things like CI build

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,920
delivery pipelines do it if you're using

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,930
Heroku for example you've got review

00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,630
apps that's kind of cool we can have to

00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:45,000
review apps collaborate with one another

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,320
we create play points of integration so

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,910
we're always looking for opportunities

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,250
for those systems to integrate that's

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,260
really important so we've created

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,860
productivity by creating seams in our

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,110
system

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,450
designing seams in our system planning

00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,040
out seams as a as a tech lead and now

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,420
we're looking to find ways of validating

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,010
the assumptions built into those seams

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:08,070
by creating opportunities for

00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:10,710
collaboration the Rope having that

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:13,130
pipeline available allowing folks to see

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,590
what the outcomes are of their work

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,060
allowing us to share that with the world

00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:20,760
creates these different feedback loops

00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,040
supporting things like transparency risk

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,810
reduction things along that line if

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,600
somebody throws over you know if you're

00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:30,030
working with a client or or a business

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,680
unit that gives you a problem says hey

00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,000
come back to me in three months that's

00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,830
your real feedback loop that's a

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,900
challenge for us a spark box that's a

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,420
problem we don't work really well that

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,560
way we taught we saver sometimes we tell

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,140
some of our clients that we're pretty

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,030
needy we need to collaborate we need to

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,560
talk with you on a base a regular basis

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,260
cuz we're we're trying to give you the

00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,510
opportunity to navigate these projects

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,460
with us trying to figure out our way to

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,470
the end and goal because we know that

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,030
we're gonna know more about our projects

00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,380
tomorrow about your problems tomorrow

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,630
than we knew today or at the beginning

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,830
of a project and so our goal is to to

00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,230
create lots of different feedback loops

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,510
for some developers your your for some

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,220
teams you're looking for a really deep

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,950
pipeline that allows these you know

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,930
review apps or deployment of PRS and

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,180
things along that line we're certainly

00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:17,820
looking for like master to get deployed

00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,080
on a regular basis that's awesome tests

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,760
things along that line those are all

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,620
important you might be looking at at

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,240
some really cool tools we we happen to

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,220
be really big fans of code climate so we

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,870
use both code climate quality as well as

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,510
code climates velocity tools

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,800
those are feedback loops on our products

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,390
and we really appreciate some of those

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,170
tools and those are those are important

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,960
to us

00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:39,000
across all of this there's there's a

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,200
saying I heard years ago and it's kind

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,460
of stuck with me I actually I can't

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,680
attribute it to anybody I should

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,840
probably Google this and find out who

00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,790
said it because I've I've repeated it

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,440
often enough that it's really not

00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,810
appropriate for me to to claim claim

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,820
credit for it but it's that leader

00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,610
should always be focusing on creating

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,930
new leaders right one of the best ways

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,740
you can do that is by giving them

00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,880
opportunities to lead to make decisions

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,890
we do that in a couple of different ways

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,550
one is by creating that vision by

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:11,160
communicating by sharing what's going on

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:13,470
we also do that by communicating with

00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:17,430
our clients and sharing our day ideas

00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:20,220
with context okay being able to clearly

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:23,250
regularly articulate what our vision are

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,350
is what our ideas are to be offer up

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,590
opportunities for other people on our

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:30,360
teams to share share their ideas to help

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,920
them prepare to clearly articulate the

00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,720
ideas that they have within their

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,630
systems provides both a leadership

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,670
opportunity as well as a communication

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,320
opportunity for you to practice those

00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,490
things and there's there's always if

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,020
you're not a tech lead today there's

00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,050
there's lots of opportunities to do that

00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,940
if you have new technology new interests

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,850
things along that line there's always an

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,320
opportunity to write about them right so

00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,520
you're gonna be creating as a tech lead

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,670
you're probably gonna be drawing

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,170
diagrams as a non tech lead as you're

00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,880
picking up cards you have the

00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:02,100
opportunity of drawing a diagram to

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,510
describe hey this is how I think things

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,640
are gonna fit does that does that make

00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,600
sense for everybody if you're a part of

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,190
a planning session where you're

00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,270
describing how two systems will

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,180
integrate with each other

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,710
you can draw diagrams you can prototype

00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,660
payloads going back and forth or

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,310
interfaces going data going back and

00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,170
forth if that's that's appropriate you

00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,180
this lives on the front end as well as

00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,410
the back end system integrations that

00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,980
all these things are possible and

00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:28,710
necessary and they set a they set out to

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,720
clarify assumptions to reduce risk on

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,740
projects and just to enable people to go

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,730
and work and be and be effective

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,620
decision-makers on their own they don't

00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:41,030
always have to be coming back to you

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,030
necessarily as a tech lead

00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:51,820
as as teams work together as teams are

00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,559
out there building things as individual

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,149
especially you know younger team members

00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:56,890
less experienced team members I guess

00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:58,480
not younger but less experienced team

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,070
members are out there working on your

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,169
projects there's always going to show up

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,870
opportunities to pair with them to work

00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:06,549
to mentor and things along that line

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:10,149
providing feedback clarifying feedback

00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:12,250
jumping in on PRS it's important to be

00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:14,409
able to do this with grace I've worked

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,020
with plenty I've acts I've been the tech

00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:20,350
lead who's kind of you know crude rude

00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,600
probably not crude but rude Curt in in

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,919
comments and things along that line the

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,419
only thing you do is cause people to

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,919
stop asking you questions stop coming to

00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:28,600
you and then you stop being a leader

00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:30,100
it's really important to be doing these

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,250
things with an open mind and empathetic

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,470
mind a patient mind and looking to build

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,490
up new leaders on your organization

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,929
through your mentoring through your

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,370
through your comments that's one of

00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:41,140
those reasons why we say it's important

00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,270
for on our team on the spark box team

00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,520
that you'd be providing just as many

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,679
just as much praise and things like pull

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,110
requests as you are feedback or thoughts

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,850
or ideas in pull requests it's really

00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,960
important that you be mentoring folks to

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,399
follow in your footsteps because

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,049
eventually they're going to become

00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,789
leaders on your team and you want them

00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:05,470
to be building the next leaders as well

00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:13,510
I was looking for an audible sigh on

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:15,490
this one not always there we go so so

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,169
when I talk about managing projects I'm

00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,640
not asking for tech leads and I'm

00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:20,770
looking at tech leads I'm not saying hey

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,770
I need you to I need you to be managing

00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,299
JIRA I need you to be starting sprints

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,830
or whatever and looking at budget and

00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:29,289
things like that necessarily managing

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:31,120
those budgets but we remember I said we

00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:33,429
need to be a partner to our PMS we need

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,320
to be a partner to those who are care

00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:37,029
about the investment that's being made

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,950
the outcomes they're coming with this

00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:40,240
thing so you need to care about those

00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,669
things too and you need to work together

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,520
our goal in all of these things is to

00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:47,260
provide our clients rpms and our team

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,659
the ability to navigate our project to

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,159
success right the place that we think we

00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:53,559
were gonna go with a project is very

00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,080
rarely exactly the place that we want to

00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:56,659
go at the end of the day things change

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,799
we

00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:00,470
understand at the beginning of

00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,639
initiative initiatives so we need to

00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,269
have an understanding of things like

00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:06,649
constraints budgets time we get a lot of

00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:09,049
clients that show up after a little

00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:10,399
we're working with and they say hey you

00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:12,259
know I've got an opportunity in this

00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:14,509
market if I can if I can just make this

00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:17,929
left turn for a little while I think we

00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:19,039
can we can actually increase revenue we

00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:22,309
can actually get this out to different

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,159
users we can POC this with a you know a

00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:26,599
new new category of customer we want to

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,729
be there for our customers we want to

00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:30,259
help them then be successful and that

00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:31,729
doesn't mean executing and I think of

00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:33,710
everybody that generally agrees with

00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:36,019
this executing a plan just for a plans

00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,399
sake all right and if you want to talk

00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:39,769
to me we can talk about how we set up

00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:41,629
projects and engagements with customers

00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:42,830
to allow for those types of things

00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:43,340
because for some people that's kind of

00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,989
scary

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,580
right we all of a sudden start to think

00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:48,259
about change of scope and and things

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,070
along that line but I'm happy to talk

00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:51,229
about that that's not necessarily

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,239
important for for right now but it is

00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:55,070
important to setting things up our goal

00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:57,289
is to be able to guide decisions right

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,779
you have a very unique insight into the

00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:01,820
overall problem at spark box usually our

00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:03,200
tech leads are a part of for new clients

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,909
at least are a part of what we would

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,320
call a discovery effort those are a

00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,809
couple of weeks a couple of you know

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,909
week two three weeks worth of effort to

00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:11,899
really understand a client to understand

00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:13,279
their problem to understand their

00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:14,989
business so that we can give them an

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,359
idea of how we what we think it's going

00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:18,830
to take to get where they want to go and

00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,139
and when our tech leads have that

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,299
insight they're able to bring back some

00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,489
context from those experiences they

00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:26,929
understand where the software is they've

00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:28,700
built software before so they can help

00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:29,830
guide these decisions with our clients

00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,820
and they're having regular relationship

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,799
conversations partnering decisions and

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,690
one of the other big parts that is in

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,970
order to be able to navigate your

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,619
projects we need our tech leads to make

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,059
sure that work and they don't have to

00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:42,889
necessarily do all of this but they are

00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,359
making sure it happens at our in our

00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:45,950
organization they need to be able to

00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:48,619
break these things down into chunks of

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,989
doable work right if we're working in

00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:52,309
large chunks big releases we don't have

00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:54,019
the opportunity to navigate and this

00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:56,450
gets into some of that that agile stuff

00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:59,299
whether you like it or not you know a

00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,340
spark box we're scrum --is-- and we do

00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:03,590
it we do it pretty well so we're looking

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,269
we're looking to deliver things and like

00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,979
a week which works really well for us

00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,269
because we invoice weekly so they're

00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:10,669
seeing their investment turned into

00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,109
reality turned into working software

00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:13,879
and they can take a look at both of

00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:15,769
those things together and make new

00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:17,090
decisions that works out really well for

00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:18,950
our customers it works out really well

00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:21,529
for us because we feel like we're all in

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,059
control of what we're building and our

00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:29,869
tech leads are a part of that they need

00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:33,169
to be a part of that conversation so

00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:34,909
when we have when we have the ability to

00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:37,759
navigate our project because we've got

00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:39,320
you know little tiny pieces of work that

00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,389
we're delivering we're involved in

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,799
discussions about budget we understand

00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:44,629
our PM's care about it but they're

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,009
working with us and we're figuring out

00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:48,830
we're making new decisions about what's

00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:50,779
next I guarantee you and I know this is

00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,190
a contentious issue but somebody's gonna

00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,330
ask about a forecast they're gonna want

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,700
to know when am I gonna get this thing

00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,559
when am I gonna see this thing you know

00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,080
I mentioned that we're scrum ish at

00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:01,489
SPARC box you know how you decide to

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,609
provide a forecast is up to you I've

00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:06,200
seen a lot of different techniques we we

00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,639
do things like relative sizing so it's

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,989
Park box it's important that our tech

00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:11,659
leaders know how to guide a team towards

00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:13,700
an economy right and and I use that word

00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:14,899
on purpose that term economy because

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,239
that's really what we're creating on our

00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:19,190
teams and we have a unique way of kind

00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:21,169
of doing that I'm happy to talk about it

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,999
afterwards how we do it I think we

00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,980
actually have some some writing on on

00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:27,200
how we tend to do it but at the end of

00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,029
the day our goal is is somehow to tell

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,220
those folks you know what they can

00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:33,889
expect over the coming coming weeks

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,590
months or years and and we do things

00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:39,080
like provide ranges and expectations we

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,669
know that it's not gonna be exact so the

00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,309
further out we estimate or provide

00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:45,649
forecasts the bigger range but spices to

00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:46,759
say if you don't provide it they're

00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:48,379
gonna find somebody who will

00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:51,109
and this is one of those places where

00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:53,359
opinions become fact really quick all

00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:55,759
right so you need to be able to provide

00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,109
these things to some degree to folks who

00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,309
care about these things because they are

00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:00,139
putting an investment in and they need

00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:04,519
to know what what the outcome will look

00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:07,700
like so when I'm when I'm interviewing

00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:10,039
folks when I'm talking to folks on our

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,109
team who want to become tech leads who

00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:15,409
want to take this this leap I should I

00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:17,119
should call out it at spark box and I

00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:18,919
think this is this is pretty true at

00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,169
most of the places I've been the idea of

00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,410
a tech lead or an architect is not

00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:25,910
necessarily a career ladder step

00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,980
I mean it takes some experience to get

00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,770
there clearly it takes some some skills

00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,660
and things like that that are built over

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:35,540
time but it's not something that you

00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,280
achieve and you stay there okay this is

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,870
a role that you take on on projects and

00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,220
and that's kind of nice for us it

00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:45,350
provides some flexibility it allows it

00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,480
allows us to find the right project for

00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,830
the right people so if you're if you're

00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,850
relatively new you think this is

00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,020
something you want to try you have a

00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,850
certain skill set a certain set of

00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,320
experiences that you've been on we can

00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,330
find a project that's kind of like that

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,520
where we know you'd be successful on

00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,220
your own and maybe put you there to be a

00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,780
tech lead with a couple other folks and

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,970
it's and explore the idea of what it's

00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,230
like to practice these things in a kind

00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,600
of a safe environment to gain new

00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,840
experiences right and one of the things

00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,250
that I'm I'm hoping because I know that

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,620
every project there's gonna be a problem

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,030
right I've never been on a project where

00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,980
everything went glorious from start to

00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:21,799
finish right I don't know if you have

00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,540
please you know coming to a talk I'm

00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:25,400
certain that somebody will step down

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,049
because they everybody in this room

00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,090
wants to know how you did it

00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:30,559
including myself but there's never been

00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,880
a project that I've been a part of where

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,000
everything was rosy from start to finish

00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,919
and so stressful times are going to come

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,330
so your ability to recover from those is

00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:39,770
super important

00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,820
you have to be able to deal with

00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,440
pressure you have to be able to deal

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,720
with negative feedback and it's gonna

00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,200
hurt and you're gonna want to react and

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,360
that's okay right your job is not to be

00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,600
perfect but your job is to recover well

00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,860
to keep composure to keep empathy

00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,390
because a lot of times those types of

00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,500
feedback are coming because the

00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:00,260
investment these folks are making

00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,880
they're being called on it too right and

00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,500
they're hoping to see the outcomes of

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,140
these things and at some point you're

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,299
gonna show something maybe it's a demo

00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,919
maybe it's three months down the line

00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:11,299
where where things aren't exactly what

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,530
they thought they were gonna be or they

00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:15,290
hear feedback from one of their own

00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,890
stakeholders that says that's not really

00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,840
what I meant

00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,880
and they're they're losing it inside

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,250
inside themselves and they're nervous

00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,500
okay so you need to be able to stay

00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,330
empathetic to them you need to be able

00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,980
to stay positive for your team knowing

00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:30,530
that you're gonna have to to solve this

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:34,490
problem right and make sure that you

00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:35,780
stay persistent and of course one of the

00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,350
worst things you can do when things go

00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,880
south

00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,919
is start to hide it

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,539
one of our first reactions is especially

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,919
when we're a really good developer when

00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:45,320
we've been successful in the past is

00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,740
like I can fix this right I'm a tech

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,110
lead I'm in charge to some degree right

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,870
I've got this promotion and this is our

00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:56,539
opportunity to like bear down use our

00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:58,730
skills and deliver this thing but really

00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:00,700
what your chance what you need to be

00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,960
doing is being incredibly transparent

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:08,600
okay you need to be showing people

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:10,340
what's what the state of things is one

00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,900
of the best ways to deal with some of

00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,360
those situations one of the kind of a

00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,940
the thing that greases the skids for bad

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,530
conversations is maintaining and being

00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,390
trans maintaining healthy relationships

00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:23,059
with all the folks on your team your

00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,340
clients people that care and being

00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:27,230
transparent with them all the time right

00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,020
the biggest thing we want to do is avoid

00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,970
having surprises as a tech lead your

00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,530
your responsibility now is not to just

00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,940
focus in and let somebody else know so

00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,919
that they can have the hard conversation

00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,450
it's now on you to partner with that

00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,510
p.m. and have that conversation with

00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,440
people and it's scary but when you've

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,179
been talking to people on a regular

00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,700
basis when you've been talking to maybe

00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:48,620
like the architect or tech lead on the

00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,659
other side of the fence right maybe on

00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,130
the other team or or talking to the

00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:54,380
customer on a regular basis these

00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,720
conversations they're usually not too

00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,299
bad you can usually see them coming

00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,700
right and they're usually happening in a

00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:04,580
in a normal situation something where

00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,440
heated and and reaction is less likely

00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,850
to happen so it's really important that

00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,590
you be able to do this it's also being

00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,240
important that as a part of healthy

00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,879
relationships you'll be able to receive

00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,609
that feedback yourself right from your

00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,470
team members and opening those those

00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:20,510
kind of conversations up asking them how

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,159
do you think I'm doing do you feel like

00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,300
you understand what's going on do you

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,520
feel like you're successful right now

00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,810
have we've given you what you need those

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,889
are important conversations to have with

00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:32,030
your whole team on a pretty regular

00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:33,020
basis so all of these provide some

00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,330
certain opportunity certain

00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:41,240
opportunities for you when you take on

00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:44,210
these leadership opportunities whether

00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,429
it's a tech lead whether it's like a

00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,770
lead developer or whatever they might be

00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:51,620
you own a feature something along that

00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:53,570
line for delivery within a

00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,520
already it comes with a whole bunch of

00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:58,030
opportunities for you to be impactful

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:03,320
both on projects but and also on people

00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:04,670
okay certainly you're gonna be doing

00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,020
things like pr's you're gonna be looking

00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,460
the codebase seeing how it evolved

00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,470
seeing how the architecture evolves

00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,510
you're gonna be creating documentation

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,700
maybe you're creating cards writing

00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,900
cards for us one of the things our tech

00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,600
leads are doing is they create a

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,310
technical strategy right this is this is

00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,650
a vision for the project maybe that's a

00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,810
two to four month project maybe it's a

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,730
two-year long project if it's a startup

00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:28,130
we're probably - creating a vision with

00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,510
with a short and a long term a couple

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,180
year vision for where this thing could

00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,560
go and they're creating documentation

00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,330
they're doing technical writing they're

00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,090
creating diagrams they're talking about

00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:39,770
how they expect the the the the

00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:42,170
architecture could evolve over time we

00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,090
repeat where we can scrimp early to get

00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:46,100
new value out things along that line

00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:47,540
those are those are certainly impactful

00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,670
decisions because they're enabling the

00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,250
team to work effectively and work

00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,600
towards that vision and they're also you

00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,490
know have opportunity to do some

00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,410
guidance and mentoring but I want to

00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:58,910
actually I want to give you an anecdote

00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,800
about a project that happened a couple

00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:02,840
of years ago where you can have a lot of

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,420
impact with your technical skill with

00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,790
your experiences with these with some of

00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,260
these opportunities so we had a client

00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,850
this is actually like this is a pretty

00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,080
darn simple scenario and I bet most of

00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,720
you have done this at some point or

00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,630
another we had worked with a client for

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,890
four or five years ago they had an

00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,050
application it was pretty cool the

00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,240
technology doesn't really matter but

00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:25,180
they came back to us and said hey our

00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,310
team has kind of it's kind of shrunk

00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,170
we're not quite as they've left their

00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,880
hair out in the valley it's really hard

00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,020
to keep team Pete folks on the feet the

00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,330
folks that really understood this

00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,860
platform this product weren't really

00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:38,270
with the team anymore so we had a way

00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:42,260
the good understanding of how this thing

00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:44,360
worked at least our technically did and

00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,120
I did I had helped with some of the

00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,440
early work on this project and we knew

00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,030
that we needed to help them out and they

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,130
said hey we've got a new opportunity it

00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,960
was in Japan was an opportunity for them

00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,640
to go to a new market but there their

00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,470
application wasn't localized right like

00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,970
it didn't didn't have support for Japan

00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:00,620
right or any other language for that

00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:03,740
matter it's a pretty simple problem

00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,910
right nothing nothing big but we know

00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,420
they only had a couple of weeks to get

00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,480
this done

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:10,880
and the product had been around for 3-4

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,830
years so it's it's not small

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,540
right they built lots of features of the

00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,340
request of customers and so you can

00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,750
imagine that's that's probably a lot of

00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,720
content on this thing that needs to be

00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,160
localized some of it as we we knew is

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,600
probably gonna be pretty simple so we

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,090
split it out into two categories the

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,290
first is like this is static content no

00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:29,840
big deal right

00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:32,390
well we know how to solve for that we're

00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,350
gonna have somebody go off and we're

00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,820
just gonna have them create like a

00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:37,490
little module function whatever you want

00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,470
to call it it doesn't matter and the

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:41,180
only job that has that thing has to do

00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:43,610
is it's given some text that's gonna

00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,320
turn it into localized text right so we

00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:48,170
said hey go out and create this thing it

00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,940
should take in some text and it's gonna

00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,050
return some text and return and it

00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,220
should be localized at first you don't

00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,630
even have to localize just spit the

00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:59,240
regular content back out spit it back

00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:01,250
out it's a no op no big deal right well

00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,410
that while the folk that person was off

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,960
working on that our tech lead was over

00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:07,970
here saying I wonder if we can fit i18n

00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,410
next in this so this actually it

00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:11,420
happened to be a job but like I wonder

00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,410
if there's a library that we can use for

00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,120
this it shouldn't be that big a deal

00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,980
right we know we have some complex

00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,660
computed translations we're gonna have

00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,010
to do where you get data you know you

00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,900
get money you get numbers things like

00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,920
that content your name whatever and

00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,470
we're gonna translate those those are

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,000
the second category of thing and so when

00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,290
when the tech lead went over and talked

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,430
to that folks he said I need you to

00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,690
create this function it's just going to

00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,010
go ahead and take a string it's going to

00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,480
return back another string but I need

00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,190
you to remember that at some point we're

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,170
gonna be given some context some data in

00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:37,880
there that's gonna be smooshed in with

00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,620
the rest of it I need you to keep that

00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,260
in mind okay that's no big deal we've

00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,150
done that before not a big deal so while

00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,610
that those folks are off creating that

00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,750
our tech lead went over and looked at

00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:49,010
some of the other ones created a couple

00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,070
proof of concepts for how we might do

00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,080
that picking out some libraries we had

00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,000
to relatively inexperienced folks that

00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,800
had only been on the team for about six

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,050
eight months they had left our

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,970
apprenticeship that we run it's about a

00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,290
six month long so they hadn't had a

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,540
whole lot of soft they hadn't built

00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:07,820
software before right they'd practiced

00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,260
it but then really done it this was a

00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,700
great opportunity a pretty well

00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,370
constrained opportunity for them to get

00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,440
involved in building some software right

00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,180
the first step towards them gaining

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,950
experience becoming a better developer

00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:23,269
themselves and maybe eventually becoming

00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:25,250
so they went off and they used this new

00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:27,980
contract that we had built out our our

00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:30,529
our tech lead had created a seam in the

00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,509
system were folks with less

00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:35,150
understanding less experience could be

00:39:32,509 --> 00:39:37,009
effective could find work could could

00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:40,759
run their make decisions on their own in

00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:41,809
the context with what they needed had

00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:43,880
somebody with a little more experience

00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:47,930
how building what that seam looked like

00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,789
building it out early getting some

00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:52,460
experience hey this is this is the seam

00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:53,960
we're gonna create now this tech lead is

00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,700
offering up this opportunity the more

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,250
experienced developer to see what it's

00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,500
like to make some of these decisions to

00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:02,000
find what a seam looks like to enable

00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,990
other people to people with less

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,700
experience we've now got a pretty cross

00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,930
cross experience team working on some

00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,670
things they don't all have to be lead

00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,289
developers they don't all have to be

00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,599
superstars that have been doing this for

00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:17,869
eight years right we supported the team

00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,430
growing right that's having impact on an

00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:20,980
organization because I now got three

00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:23,109
people with new experiences on

00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,190
localization that's not a hard problem

00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:26,960
but because of the way we were able to

00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,670
execute on it because we had a strategy

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,259
because our tech lead was offering other

00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,029
people opportunities to build things out

00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:35,420
and we were giving experience to new

00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:37,579
developers everybody is now more

00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,710
experienced than they once were that's

00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:41,150
having an impact on an organization

00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,910
that's having an impact on a client and

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:46,000
we were able to do it in two weeks and

00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:48,289
three of the two of the three developers

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,930
had never really shipped production

00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:53,329
software before what an awesome thing to

00:40:50,930 --> 00:41:03,890
put on your resume two to three weeks

00:40:53,329 --> 00:41:05,450
out of an apprenticeship so as as a tech

00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,750
lead as somebody who wants to be a

00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,789
techie

00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,890
raise your hand if you said you you you

00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:11,960
were a tech lead right

00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:14,000
okay so you've you've got you've walked

00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,589
down this road before right and

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
hopefully you're talking to other folks

00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:18,829
in your organization who are eventually

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,119
going to become a tech lead raise your

00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:22,279
hand if you're just if you're a manager

00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,529
if you manage a few folks and things

00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:26,660
along that line these are some

00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:28,400
opportunities for you to look at and you

00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:31,039
as an individual for you to look at

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,450
growing your own organization for you as

00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:33,450
an individual who want to become a tech

00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,680
lead

00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,990
is a tech lead hopefully some of these

00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,079
opportunities sound familiar and you've

00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:41,790
been walking through them one of the

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,800
things that I'd like to say is true but

00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:48,869
is probably less true than we'd like to

00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,369
like to believe I think this is

00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:53,880
especially true because I always thought

00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:56,310
it was true but now that I'm in a role

00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,050
where my goal my core responsibility is

00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,640
to build up my team I realized that I'm

00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,520
not actually as good at this is that

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,680
that the actions of our team members

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,599
speak for themselves right that I know

00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,010
everything that's going on I know every

00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,630
experience that my team members are

00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:12,359
seeing and that's just not the case

00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,430
so as individuals who want to become

00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:15,839
tech leads you're gonna have to make a

00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:19,829
plan there's gonna be some things that

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,810
go on as as managers as tech lead

00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,910
yourself or technical directors or or

00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:26,010
whatever you need to be conscious about

00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,300
these things so one of the things that I

00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,970
think is really important for you to do

00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:32,780
is let's have a plan right have a plan

00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:36,180
for your people have a plan for yourself

00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:38,940
we do kind of every say half year goals

00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,099
at our organization we have our tech

00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:43,410
lead description written up we know what

00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:45,599
it means most of this stuff is in there

00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:47,160
and we'll go through that and we'll say

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,650
hey if you had an opportunity to do this

00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,880
if not let's let's find that over the

00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:56,400
next six months here are some examples

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,780
we asked our team members to start doing

00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,760
the same thing go through these this

00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,380
description go through this and try to

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,050
find experiences in your existing

00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,400
projects let's create a plan together it

00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:07,890
might take us a couple years to get

00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,660
there that's okay I can have this

00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:11,490
conversation with my apprentices now and

00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,280
say hey I know in about four or five

00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:15,990
years or maybe less if you get there

00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,250
maybe it works out I know that in a

00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,780
couple of years you're you're gonna

00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,670
wanna you're gonna want to jump up to

00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,950
this and that's cool let's talk about it

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:25,410
let's find a way to make that happen

00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:26,609
here's a plan alright and we're gonna

00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,750
create some goals we're gonna create

00:43:26,609 --> 00:43:29,490
some actions and things along that line

00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:31,230
and we're going to talk about it

00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:34,980
I have one-on-ones with everybody on my

00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:37,020
team our tech leads often depending on

00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,040
the project and how involved we are how

00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,050
big the project is we'll have

00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,510
one-on-ones with individual members on

00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:44,160
their team and that's what we talk about

00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:46,860
how are things going where are you on

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,940
your plan can I help with anything

00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,320
an experience you wish you would have

00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,630
had that you saw on this project that

00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,710
maybe we can do on another feature what

00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,840
kind of things are coming up in the

00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,780
roadmap for your project where you can

00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,310
have an opportunity to demo to customers

00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:01,200
maybe you can draw the diagrams for this

00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,670
work with the tech lead on on drawing up

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,300
the diagrams and you present it to the

00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,620
team and instead of the tech lead being

00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,660
the one who does all the work does all

00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:16,080
the diagramming sets the vision they're

00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:17,370
helping you do that this is something a

00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,320
lot of folks on my team have started

00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,270
doing they've created they're basically

00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,420
resumes right at the end that's what it

00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,870
is

00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,520
but they call it a brag sheet when I was

00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:29,610
having those conversations with our VP

00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:32,400
six seven years ago about what it looked

00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:33,480
like to grow our team we were really

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,940
worried that one of the things that we

00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,560
would have to do is let people go not

00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,900
like let them go but like let them leave

00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,630
that there's a season for everybody at

00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,400
our company and that for in for over in

00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,050
order for them to gain some of these new

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,540
experiences they might have to to leave

00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:51,150
spark box to gain those and we know that

00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:54,060
that's gonna happen we really didn't

00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:57,390
want it to happen so our goal is to help

00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,340
build up their resume that's my goal my

00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:02,010
goal is everybody on our team every year

00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,120
that they have a handful of new bullets

00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:05,420
on their resume that talk about how

00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,950
awesome they did this year right and

00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,990
some of them have left and that's okay

00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:12,630
there are seasons for for their time at

00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:14,790
spark box and that's okay right because

00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,650
I know that while they've been there

00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,600
we've been able to create a handful of

00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,550
other tech leads right behind them

00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:25,560
because that's their responsibility as

00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:27,750
well okay partner with other leaders we

00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,790
talked about this the idea that you can

00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,370
work with your p.m. even now as an

00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:35,190
individual contributor on a team maybe

00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:37,350
around features other tech leads in the

00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,390
organization you can work with all kinds

00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,890
of folks having a mentor finding a

00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:41,820
mentor outside of your organization is

00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:43,800
okay too

00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,370
I've had a chance to talk with lots of

00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,500
folks here

00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,580
I've had mentors in the past as I've

00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,530
gone through different roles in my

00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,530
career those are those are important

00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:57,300
there's times even before you kind of at

00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,500
least at spark box so we do a handful of

00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,780
things that are they're pretty fun and

00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,910
they're all crafted around the idea of

00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:05,250
of leveling up our team so every other

00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:07,140
Friday we have all team demos and our

00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,940
it's like an all kind of like an All

00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:11,070
Hands meeting it's one hour long they're

00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:14,970
all recorded they're done over zoom for

00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:17,010
us and every team is asked to have

00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:18,690
somebody there to demo five minutes max

00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,240
what their what their team has been

00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,610
doing sometimes it's a demo about the

00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,680
upcoming features sometimes it's a demo

00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,850
about what they just built sometimes I

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,590
just got done I last week I was in

00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,450
Atlanta hanging out with a new potential

00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:31,650
client and we had a tech lead there the

00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,630
person that will probably be the tech

00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,700
lead on this project next week we're

00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,650
gonna have that person explain what the

00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,380
technical strategy will be for that

00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:42,000
particular client they're gonna help me

00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,590
with that technical strategy and figure

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,300
out what that looks like this is an

00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:47,610
opportunity for them to present their

00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,470
vision to our vision for what this is

00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:52,680
going to look like to try to do that

00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:54,180
clearly convincingly to our team it's

00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,890
pretty safe so every two weeks we've got

00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,740
an opportunity for new tech leads to

00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:01,590
grow we do demos with all of our clients

00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:03,720
every week right around the same time we

00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:05,640
invoice this is an opportunity for them

00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,510
to be in front of customers to practice

00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:11,760
that experience we do planning every

00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:14,100
week same time just about for most

00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,240
projects they're breaking these things

00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,010
apart it's a pretty collaborative

00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,450
experience our tech leads goal is to

00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:20,070
facilitate it they may bring some things

00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:21,450
with them but the whole team has an

00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,190
opportunity to talk about these things

00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,350
it's an opportunity for all of our team

00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:27,240
members to grow even that and all of

00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:33,800
them to contribute this is pretty cool

00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:37,830
it's an it's a neat opportunity so

00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:39,960
everybody in this room is what I would

00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:41,820
call a maker and one of the best things

00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,340
I you know I consider myself a maker a

00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:47,760
creator and one of the best things that

00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:49,800
you can experience as a maker is seeing

00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,620
other people use your stuff right

00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,090
there's no better experience I had an

00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,580
experience years ago I worked for a

00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:59,070
company that did fuel convenience-store

00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:01,740
kind of company sold fuel and we built a

00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:03,360
rewards program with a kiosk and cards

00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,830
and all these things and there was there

00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,880
was one of them right down the road and

00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:07,320
I got to tell you I went to that gas

00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,620
station off a lot just to see my stuff

00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:12,420
being used right cuz it's cool you love

00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,800
seeing the thing you put hard work into

00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,090
being used

00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,850
when you're a tech lead you've become a

00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:19,170
force multiplier that sounds silly but

00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,730
at the end of the day you're enabling a

00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,620
whole lot of team to build towards a

00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:25,380
vision that you all built together and

00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:28,530
you can do more as a team than you can

00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,510
by yourself right so your objective is

00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,760
to find a way to enable a whole bunch of

00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:34,830
people to work towards a vision so you

00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,080
can see some pretty cool stuff out there

00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:42,540
in out there working that's a great

00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:43,980
feeling as a maker when you have a plan

00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,510
for how you want to get there for all

00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,850
these folks you're gonna have an

00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:49,470
opportunity to build your career towards

00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:51,360
some of these out toward some of these

00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:54,270
roles tech lead things along that line

00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,560
there's opportunities are all over the

00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:58,950
place every single day for you to

00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,450
practice these skills if anybody here

00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:03,000
one of the things that I've done from

00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:04,230
time to time is I've mentored and talked

00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,760
to folks that are outside of our

00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:07,230
organization I love doing that kind of

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,000
stuff if you're looking at trying to

00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:10,290
create a plan while we're here I'm happy

00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,120
to talk about it over lunch in the

00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,590
evening you can find me on Twitter and

00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,330

00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:16,560
what your plan looks like I'm happy to

00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,640
share what our tech lead description

00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,650
looks like eventually it will be

00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,570
published we've just been working

00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:23,220
