Publication date: 2015-04-30
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Implementing a tool to automate IT infrastructure management has many undeniable benefits and is quickly becoming an industry standard. But using a tool like this usually has a pretty significant impact: new processes, new language(s) to learn, new way of doing pretty much everything on your infrastructure. Doing so in coordination with different profiles having a different view on the same infrastructure can be challenging. Moreover, there is a big risk that a &quot;devops hero&quot; holding the project becomes a bottleneck of the new process.
Some tools need a minimal skillset that must be acquired before using them. That is not an option for everyone in the team when they don't have enough time and willingness dedicated to learning a new language. Rudder is an easy to use, web-driven, role-based solution for IT Infrastructure Automation & Compliance. As such it lets different user profiles, from technical experts to manager and junior sysadmin concentrate on their part of the work and gives feedback on the infrastructure status at different levels.
This talk will show the advantages of Rudder when working in a team, how this product helps working together on infrastructure automation. You will see a real world scenario with a project carried out by different profiles such as an IT automation expert, a manager or a security officer, collaborating to install and use Rudder on an existing platform.
