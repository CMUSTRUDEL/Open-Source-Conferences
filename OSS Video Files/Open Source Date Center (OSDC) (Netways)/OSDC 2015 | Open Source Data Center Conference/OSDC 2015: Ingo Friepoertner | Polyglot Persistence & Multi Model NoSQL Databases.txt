Title: OSDC 2015: Ingo Friepoertner | Polyglot Persistence & Multi Model NoSQL Databases

Description: 
	In many modern applications the database side is realized using polyglot persistence? Store each data format (graphs, documents, etc.) in an appropriate separate database.
This approach yields several benefits, databases are optimized for their specific duty, however there are also drawbacks:

    keep all databases in sync
    queries might require data from several databases
    experts needed for all used systems

A multi-model database is not restricted to one data format, but can cope with several of them.
In this talk I will present how a multi-model database can be used in a polyglot persistence setup and how it will reduce the effort drastically.
