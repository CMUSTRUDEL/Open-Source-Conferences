Title: OSDC 2015: Bernd Mathiske | Wy the Datacenter Needs an Operating System
Publication date: 2015-04-29
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Developers are moving away from their host-based patterns and adopting a new mindset around the idea that the datacenter is the computer. It?s quickly becoming a mainstream model that you can view a warehouse full of servers as a single computer (with terabytes of memory and tens of thousands of cores). There is a key missing piece, which is an operating system for the datacenter (DCOS), which would provide the same OS functionality and core OS abstractions across thousands of machines that an OS provides on a single machine today. In this session, we will discuss:

How the abstraction of an OS has evolved over time and can cleanly scale to spand thousands of machines in a datacenter.
How key open source technologies like the Apache Mesos distributed systems kernel provide the key underpinnings for a DCOS.
How developers can layer core system services on top of a distributed systems kernel, including an init system (Marathon), cron (Chronos), service discovery (DNS), and storage (HDFS)
What would the interface to the DCOS look like? How would you use it?
How you would install and operate datacenter services, including Apache Spark, Apache Cassandra, Apache Kafka, Apache Hadoop, Apache YARN, Apache HDFS, and Google's Kubernetes.
How will developers build datacenter-scale apps, programmed against the datacenter OS like it?s a single machine?
