Title: OSDC 2015: James Fryman | DevOps Next Steps - Event Driven Operation
Publication date: 2015-04-29
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	The most critical component of building out successful DevOps culture is creating a successful merger of sustainable technology and process. ChatOps practices help teams accelerate delivery by bringing in technology operations inline with conversations already happening today. This in turn helps turns operations into simple events than can be chained together to make teams even more powerful and flexible than ever before! This talk discusses the practical implementations of ChatOps and how it can be used to grow teams of all types and sizes.

hopefully lunch was great at least for

00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:16,520
me it was pretty much awesome next up is

00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:20,410
James Fryman with event with an

00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,880
operations DevOps next step have fun

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:26,750
have fun we're gonna have fun right oh

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,029
all right thank you I haven't done

00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,830
anything yet so you know you might want

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,379
to hold your applause so quick tidbit of

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,150
fact I like to try to make sure that

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:36,800
these talks are actually useful for

00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,570
people and so one of the things that

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,730
somebody taught me very early on is

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,070
trying to factor about how much money is

00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,260
being spent on you speaking right now so

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,270
I did a quick little recap of how long

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,129
it take or how much the average salary

00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,629
for you guys here in Germany is and

00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:51,620
about how long I'm going to talk and it

00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:54,469
comes out to be about twenty five

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,719
hundred dollars us so or 2500 year I'm

00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:58,670
sorry so I'm hoping that twenty five

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,680
hundred euro of words will come out of

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,940
my mouth and if it does please clap at

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,580
the end if it doesn't boo me or come up

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,770
to after the fact right so it's totally

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,210
cool so event-driven automations I think

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,130
I have to start about what I actually

00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,100
mean about event-driven automations and

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,270
this is a very overloaded thing okay so

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,490
what I actually mean about event-driven

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,020
automations starts with the cultural

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,920
change its going to have to happen and

00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,750
is really a thinly veiled word usage for

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,560
me to introduce the concept of chat ups

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:31,610
to everybody so quick show of hands who

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,590
is heard of chat ups one two three okay

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,110
good for so this will be a really great

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,939
conversation of the four people that are

00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,290
using chata or your sort of it are you

00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:47,060
using it anybody using chat ops nobody

00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:50,030
okay so either either either the four

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,590
people really hate the idea or I'm going

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,750
to encourage you by the end of this talk

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,579
if you have not used chat ups you will

00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,350
never work another way again once you do

00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,720
start this is how powerful I think that

00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,540
this talk is going to be but well I like

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,549
to start with stories all of my talks

00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,369
start with stories and big story teller

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,440
so I put your head and put your put your

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,660
mind in this head space for a moment and

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,400
and and and and if this has ever

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,489
happened to you kind of just chuckle

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,800
inside internally so you're in

00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:19,770
operations and you work with computers

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
and

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,260
something happens maybe you've seen this

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,950
screen before and suddenly you've got to

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,570
fix this thing right and you go get onto

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,670
this war room whatever this maybe maybe

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,280
it's a bridge that you dial into maybe

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,080
you all just shuffle into the an actual

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,370
physical room and you know get all

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,170
boarded up with pizza coming in

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,820
constantly to keep feeding you whatever

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,820
right so there's this warm room going on

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,250
to fix things don't mess with us

00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,140
something super critical is happening

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,940
right there's people moving trying to

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,280
get service restored the company's

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,640
losing money whatever and then out of

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,860
sudden somebody comes up to you some VP

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,370
and says hey how's it going what's the

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,680
status and everything stops because you

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,210
got to give that VP update right and so

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,770
all the communication was happening to

00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,330
restore services and all the amount of

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,890
downtime that you're having associated

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,990
with trying to restore that service

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,810
suddenly becomes less important than

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,450
telling this one person what the status

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,820
of the of the downtime is hugely

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,030
inefficient well chat ops helps with

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,310
this ok next story let's say you're

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,560
working on this amazing new thing is you

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,850
your developer you this fantastic new

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,680
feature you're really excited about

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,570
you've been working on for days weeks

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,650
months maybe even years if you're in one

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,390
of those really slowly moving

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,730
enterprises and you want to deploy this

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,870
thing well the first thing that you get

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,840
brought up with is you got to go to a

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,950
change control meeting ok so I'm going

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,240
to go to the change control meeting I'm

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:56,880
going to fill out a bunch of things oh I

00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:59,100
got the kelsey bug maybe if i just stop

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,510
I don't get change control approval for

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,160
this come this just a clock ya know

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,810
alright I'm let me just keep trying so

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,730
so you fill out these change control

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,470
approvals and and then you have to go to

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,910
the meetings and people yell at you no

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,910
we're not going to let that change in

00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,049
maybe if I just stand really still we're

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,250
not going to let that change in unless

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:21,660
you go fill out some more paperwork so

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,040
you go fill out that more paperwork and

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,570
everything gets approved you've gone

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,270
through this process and suddenly it

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,760
goes behind the black back door of

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,470
operations you have no idea what happens

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,600
in here right you hand your code to

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,010
these people and you say please make

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
run and they go off into their corner

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,880
and they do their thing and guess what

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,530
it fails you've gone through all of this

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,720
effort to try to get it out there you've

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,130
involved change control people meetings

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,630
upon meetings and developer

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,730
conversations to try to get your code

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,320
pushed in to hand it to this team we

00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:56,090
have no idea what happens only for them

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:59,220
to come back and say it failed like this

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:02,690
Chad ops helps with this not this but

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,820
this maybe maybe you're a new employee

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,560
right and the hardest thing about a new

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,750
employees onboarding trying to get that

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,250
time associated with figuring out how

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,540
the company works figuring out what your

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,490
job is going to be figuring out how to

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,380
interface with your team how do you even

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,330
do the things you've just got hired to

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,220
do because it turns out no job is

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,600
actually the same in a cookie cutter

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,160
environment as much as we want to trust

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,450
say like if we create all the servers

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,800
the same way the next time I go to the

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,840
next job it'll be the same right that

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,700
doesn't work that way right so now

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,140
there's this onboarding process and now

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,030
I've got to go figure out how to

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,370
efficiently get team members on how do I

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,920
get on boarded well chat apps helps with

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,280
that too and then maybe you're just

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,550
having a horrible horrible day because

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,000
guess what you work with computers and

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:52,140
you just need a picture of a cute kitten

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,330
chat ups also helps with this so event

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,520
driven automations is what I'm going to

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,500
talk about it's a larger theme and I

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,120
think chaps is part of this chat ups is

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,400
the what I'm what I want to talk about

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,770
what chat ups is chaps is the cultural

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,330
change the change it needs to happen

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,770
within your teams and the change it

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,380
needs to happen within your organization

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,780
in order to expose all of this awesome

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,790
we're working toward right it's it's so

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,590
much cool that all of us in this room

00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,470
are working on fundamentally changing

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,690
the world Silicon Valley style right

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,480
changing how we do operations by making

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,970
it easier to do deployment or whatnot

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,730
but these are consuming utilities for us

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,530
what about the business what about the

00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,050
rest of the organization that we're

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,970
actually serving all right we lose sight

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,350
of this often and this is what I want to

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,260
talk about with event-driven automations

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,960
because with chat ops lead you to the

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,220
actual end state of utopia which is true

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,650
event-driven automations where the

00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,870
computer is doing everything so

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,259
let's see if I can tell you how we get

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:54,440
there so hi my name is James Freeman and

00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,000
I work at a company called stack storm

00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,199
this will not be a sales pitch I promise

00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
none of the things I'm going to talk

00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,800
about i will talk specifically about

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,220
stack storm i may say the name once or

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,110
twice so don't hold it against me but

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,400
basically what we're trying to do is all

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,039
of the words that are coming out of my

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,270
mouth we want to solve this problem so

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,490
if you're interested in talking more

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,080
about what a tool can do help you with

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,150
cultural change as well as technology

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,800
change come find me afterwards we'll

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,150
talk about it but this won't be about

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,940
stack storms will be batchat ops an

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:28,500
event-driven automation so let's talk

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:31,410
about it what is it well first off chat

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,789
ops a term coined by github so this is

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,050
where I was first introduced to it so I

00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,419
used to work for github for about two

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,280
years and they coined this term very

00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:40,889
early on and it helped them with

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,320
delegating responsibilities and tasks to

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,000
a bot they have a bot called Hugh bought

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,550
that they created that they basically

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,830
used in order to give it simple tasks

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,810
that were not value add necessaries for

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,250
them to do right a developer doesn't

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,870
really want to care about how code gets

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,760
out to production because I've solved

00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,349
that problem that's a feature so why not

00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,210
let somebody something else go do it

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:02,099
traditionally that's a human let's go

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,150
let the ops people go do it well github

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,530
took a different approach and say well

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,050
let's a little bot do it and see what

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:10,229
happens and exploded right now this is

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,199
not a new concept right I don't who has

00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:16,380
been around in chat rooms since like IRC

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,270
right okay awesome right you've had bots

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,310
in there to tell you the weather and get

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,289
you cool sports stats but this is like

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,570
next-level stuff here this is where you

00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,849
actually give the bots some real scary

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,470
power and it's interesting to see what

00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:31,680
happens as a result of that from both a

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,240
technology and a cultural change so

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,800
there's some common tools that are

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,690
associated with this and all kind of

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,490
briefly touch on all three of them how

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,690
what's beneficial which one maybe you

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,930
should choose if you're going to go down

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:45,480
this road so Hugh bot is the original

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,160
cubot is written in CoffeeScript so if

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,380
you're coffeescript lover not like me

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,880
then that's a wonderful place to go and

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,040
that's actually a really good place to

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,900
be because now we're coming up with full

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,120
stack developers write a bunch of people

00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,310
coming out of school and whatnot just

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,490
having known JavaScript will you throw

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,339
them in front of this and suddenly

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,320
now they have power to add to this great

00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,209
maybe you're a ruby shop and you like

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,740
Ruby because I like Ruby and then

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:11,500
there's Lita which is more or less a

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,560
one-to-one replacement of the concepts

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,000
of hue bot in Ruby cool and then if you

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,860
had just happen to be the one of like

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,290
four places in the world that are Python

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,570
shops like stack storm there's a right

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:26,080
Anders is again same concept written in

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,700
Python now when you choose these things

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,500
it's real important to understand like

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,959
ecosystem and community around these

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,029
cubot being the oldest has the largest

00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:37,300
view of like out-of-the-box plugins to

00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:38,920
get started with I Lita is coming up

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,170
close second right a lot of folks that

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,470
are ditching the CoffeeScript bandwagon

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,450
running over to talita the the plug-in

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,550
library is being accumulated not quite

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,080
as much so there's a little less

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,060
functionality and then or is kind of

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,390
coming up third behind just because you

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,770
know python so um where stack stone fits

00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,959
into this is we actually sit on top of

00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,970
all of these things and again I'll talk

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,709
about what that means but we're trying

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,079
to solve a bigger problem here I'll come

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:07,450
back to that but stack storm wants to be

00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:11,040
the place where all your chat ups needs

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:14,230
are served but why can you see that why

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,660
well we've spent so much time talking

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,690
about all these cool tools today right

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,270
we've talked about fleet and console in

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,520
and terraformed well if you noticed

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,540
right all of the you know especially in

00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,640
the last demonstration which was

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,890
fantastic there was a console associated

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,149
with that right well what happens today

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,070
when you want to show somebody's hey

00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,810
come up to my screen right come up to me

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,920
and sit next to me or let's jump on this

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,720
web thing and you can stare at my

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,850
console right and that's how you pair

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,040
program program as a developer or

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,690
sysadmin you know watch me do these

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,940
things on this on this command line and

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,339
then you go replicate them well that's

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,110
good and bad right the bad part is is

00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:52,990
that when you go give a task to somebody

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,120
and say hey I need this done they go off

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,270
into a corner you have no idea what

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,850
happens well chaps wants to try to

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,260
change this and instead of executing the

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,320
commands that you would normally execute

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,870
on a command line now you have a shared

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,130
console the shared command line so when

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,560
somebody execute something in the

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,230
context of a chaps command you see it I

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,680
see it everybody in the organization

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,360
sees it over transparency right like so

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,440
if that's your key making sure that

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,640
people can collaborate and communicate

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,470
this is huge having some shared place

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,150
where folks can execute commands and get

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,220
the response and feedback right away

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,350
there's no waiting for the ops guy to

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,790
come back and say it didn't work you're

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,560
going to know pretty quickly right hey

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,050
it didn't work right and so will the ops

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,170
guy and you both have the context about

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,250
this and that's the key right all of

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,440
these things we're talking about in

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,920
order to make our lives better deploying

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,290
fast ourselves you know all these things

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,680
mean nothing if we speed up the

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,240
computers and don't speed us up right we

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,340
as humans still have to jump into this

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,320
and define the business project process

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,420
define the business logic these

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,210
computers are going to go execute so

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,590
having a shared context in a place where

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,480
everybody can see it everybody can

00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,960
execute it and everybody can respond to

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,990
it speeds that up that feedback loop of

00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,360
emails and meetings and change control

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,460
and phone calls whatever those may be

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,070
they disappear because if you'd let that

00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,710
glue happens instantaneously and here's

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,360
an example of this I'm actually going to

00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,860
try some live chat ups here after a bit

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,270
we're going to cross our fingers and

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,760
hope that the demo gods are with us

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:34,810
today but like this is a real world

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,180
example we're at github we would do

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,580
performance analysis all the time right

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,290
how fast is the website running how many

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,270
requests are coming in are we receiving

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,130
airs whatever that may be and if you're

00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,720
doing ops well you're doing dev well

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,210
you're stuffing everything you possibly

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,490
can into a time-series database right

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,890
what we did is we went and used our

00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,840
command our chat ops to go query you

00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,490
that time series database in this kit

00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,400
instance it was graphite and we would

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,890
drop that information into chat now why

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,800
this is interesting is because imagine a

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,630
failure scenario okay you're in that

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,220
scenario where where everything's broken

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,040
and everybody's trying to figure out

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,690
what's going on okay well instead of

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,730
somebody you know waiting and going into

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,080
I oh wait trying to do some research on

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,970
the back end and then coming on to

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,280
whatever your shared context is your

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,680
your physical room your virtual room

00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,840
whatever that may be well the graph just

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,300
shows up and something really

00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,610
interesting happens

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,839
we're pattern matters and so somebody

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,850
pulls up a graph based on what they

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,080
their intuition or what they think maybe

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,370
the problem is they're kind of poking

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,709
around and feeling in the edges out of

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,720
the problem somebody else sees and says

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:42,089
I have a different idea and they run a

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,769
slightly different graph somebody else

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,360
sees it oh I have a different idea they

00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,940
were in a slightly different graph when

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,060
is it happening is the ability to get to

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,000
a resolution have been so much faster so

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,380
much faster and that's because we now

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,060
have a shared context and we're

00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:03,360
collaborating around how to discover and

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:05,310
repair right this is really cool so by

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,660
me clearing a couple Graf's I can

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,250
suddenly like have the ability in the

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,130
power to share with everybody here's

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,890
what's going on that VP comes in don't

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,920
stop your talk run chaps command let him

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:19,019
look or even better yet let him run the

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,310
command I'm come back to that just going

00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:27,120
to plant that seed there the second bit

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:30,720
is enabling team scaling team scaling is

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,370
huge for chat ups so one of these things

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,270
that I like to talk about is the idea of

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,440
becoming a force multiplier right as

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,420
technologists we should be making our

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,010
job and everybody else around us smarter

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,079
in any way that we can we have a

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,779
specific skill we have something we're

00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:48,630
good at and most of us love to share

00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,010
that knowledge right the problem is is

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,890
not enough hours in the day to learn

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,720
everything there just isn't really isn't

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,790
and for those of you who are still

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,440
trying to meet reach the mecca of the

00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,550
generalist and system administration I

00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,209
don't even know how you do it nowadays

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,550
right there's so much out there so what

00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:07,829
is how does chaps help with that well

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,390
what you're able to do is you're able to

00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:10,529
that's the wrong slide so what you're

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:16,470
able to do is you're able to start

00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:18,750
giving giving or requesting subject

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:26,910
matter experts to go in and codify their

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:28,769
own knowledge into chat codify their

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:32,130
knowledge into these chat ops commands

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:33,810
right and then everybody now has the

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,550
access to execute these things so

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,500
suddenly the my sequel person who's gone

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,079
off and created you know commonly known

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,270
tasks like here's a here's how to create

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,980
a database backup

00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,800
normally I had to call to my sequel guy

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,650
or gal wait for them to like get through

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,120
their queue of DBA tasks maybe they'll

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,410
back it up for me in three weeks later I

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,600
can actually run the migration that I

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,070
care about right well I don't want to do

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,630
that I want to run micro migration right

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,760
this second this is the deploy time

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,920
right and the DBA has given me the

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,860
ability to do this by codifying their

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,290
knowledge into chat ops now I have the

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,000
ability to run those commands same thing

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,370
can happen on any part of the stack the

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,280
networking stack the application stack

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,440
the operation stack whatever the stack

00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,180
is as folks start to really leverage

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,640
chat ops everybody becomes more powerful

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,890
indirectly right not directly indirectly

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,810
ever that powers been codified and

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,310
everybody gets to leverage it now you

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,110
know that though you can go through and

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,150
now read this code it is now have been

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,500
codified infrastructures code one of

00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,210
those great concepts we've heard here a

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,270
couple times and folks can go learn

00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:40,160
those things on their own time or you

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,170
know not and just use the commands and

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,840
be powerful either is acceptable really

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:47,180
but by providing that interface and

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,900
providing that ability everybody gets to

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:53,690
grow everybody gets faster and then

00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,370
safety is a huge thing to write you know

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,700
I'm kind of alluding to this idea of

00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,520
giving scary commands to people and this

00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,710
is okay because we're using chat ups to

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,900
make safety right I like to bowl with

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,520
the bumpers up you ever seen a bowling

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,070
with the bumpers so I hit some pins

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,780
right you know I man I hate losing right

00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,040
so you want to hit some pins right and

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,130
that's basically what chat upstarts

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,200
allows you to do is build some build the

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,089
bumpers into your process into your

00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,339
workflow such that the things that you

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:26,500
know and have defined that our safe can

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:29,060
now be executed by anybody oh it's cool

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,190
you get to define the boundaries and the

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:34,670
parameters right we were talking earlier

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,230
about about features and right creating

00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,910
interfaces for people to consume you

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,100
give everybody all of the options there

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,210
they're going to run into a decision

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,590
fatigue they're just not going to be

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,780
able to do anything but you give them a

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,360
some subset of options with some safety

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,950
around it people will just go nuts we'll

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,120
start leveraging this you talk some more

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:54,800
about this also let's be frank this is

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,740
kind of an added by byproduct of chat

00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,510
ops

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,460
once a good chat ops program starts

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,810
establishing you start being executing

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,730
these things in the context of chat all

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,710
the time now what ends up happening is

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,970
if you're not a remote company it starts

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,130
with suddenly you're not really talking

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,870
to each other in in work physically

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,440
using words you're chatting at each

00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,700
other right my CEO at stag storm kind of

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,890
made a joke the other days is kind of

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,290
interesting working at a company kind of

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,060
really heads down like this specifically

00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,620
focusing on things like chat ups because

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,000
he'll be sitting there working and then

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,410
all of a sudden four or five people will

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,600
just get up and walk out of the door and

00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,760
i'll just be like what is going on well

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,320
they agreed that it's lunchtime and they

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,410
wouldn't figured it out right but that's

00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,480
the power and once that happens well who

00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,810
cares where you're at at that point be

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,610
on the beach go give a talk in germany

00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,710
right it doesn't matter your work can

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,690
get done in the same way as if you were

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,090
sitting in the physical location with

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,680
other people that's pretty cool like I

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,970
don't know about you but like if I'm

00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,070
still working and sitting in an office

00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,170
in 10 years I'm gonna be real sad about

00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,970
the state of things right we should be

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:03,440
able to go to the beaches and have good

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:06,020
times and still get our work done okay

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,640
so how I got you salivating a little bit

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,600
about this are you excited about this so

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,860
far okay or maybe I see some smiles

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,270
Stoke yeah okay alright cool so let's

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,960
talk about design what does it actually

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:21,650
mean to build a chat ops program number

00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,990
one you have to keep it small so I've

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,600
alluded to this but chat apps is a huge

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,610
cultural change right and and I don't

00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,400
like to bring this up lightly but let's

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:33,770
just call a spade a spade a lot of folks

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,390
are afraid of automation what it's going

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,860
to mean for them how it's going to

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,630
affect them how it's going to affect the

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,310
bottom line of the company tons of

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,330
things around automation that when you

00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,360
come in and say I'm going to make your

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,620
life easier that's not what they hear

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,220
right they hear you're going to make my

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:52,090
job go away right well so there's that

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,950
barrier and in reality good companies

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,120
good capitalist companies you know when

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,670
you figure out how to decrease the

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,620
amount of effort associated with growing

00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,630
the business and you make the curve of

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,220
effort slightly sloped downwards and

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,070
there's some effort or you know there's

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,960
some extra space in that graph

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,640
well it turns out if you're a good

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,860
capitalist you're going to fill that

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,570
with extra things and you're going to

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,460
constantly be fighting this so nobody

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,720
ever really goes out of a job unless

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,610
they were just looking for an excuse

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,250
which is here nor there that's that's

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,870
always fun but really you got to keep it

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,890
small and the reason you keep it small

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:32,380
so it's about slow specific mindful

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:34,630
change create one thing right the one

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,360
thing that you get asked for all of the

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,320
time whatever that may be I know it's in

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,600
your head right now you're thinking

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,760
about it and it's one of those non-value

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,770
add necessary things that you've got to

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,270
do in order to keep your job or

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,390
operations running whatever that may

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:52,090
mean maybe it's file malware reports or

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:56,290
create new issues for failures or

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:58,090
something by creating small things in

00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:03,100
removing friction which I'm going to

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:05,260
talk about you get adoption it also

00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,280
write all of these things and keeping

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,560
them small you're going to encourage

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,720
people to go to these if at any point

00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,000
you create a chat ops command this

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,600
suddenly introduces more or even the

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,820
same amount of effort as the previous

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,380
command no one is going to use it

00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,270
because it going to be easier for them

00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,920
to leverage their existing knowledge to

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,320
go use the existing tool than to fight

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,630
and learn how to do something else chat

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,390
ups commands should be intuitive should

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,690
be easy should be your native language

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,280
modeled whatever that means for you so

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,760
that the folks who use it is just there

00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:42,130
and they just consume it right we talked

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,510
Mitchell said earlier right it's the one

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,980
command I want to be able to do one

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:49,210
command that's what you want to strive

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:51,070
for right so now also like how do we how

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,600
do I give these things to folks right

00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,370
what does it actually mean to type in a

00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,350
chat ups command and how do I care about

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:58,530
it right the first thing is described

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,180
the service and a service doesn't mean

00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:04,420
Jenkins a service doesn't mean Travis

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,730
the service means your CI build okay and

00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,130
your service means the graph the TSD be

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,100
now at github we actually started very

00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,930
early using English language go do this

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,880
thing for me and Travis go do this thing

00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,010
for me in this application well that's

00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,490
great until suddenly you need to change

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,250
the application and

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:24,020
now the behavior is now burnt in that

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,400
it's hard coded toward that actual

00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,809
application is posed to the service

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,840
right this is just kind of common ops

00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:32,090
knowledge right well with chat ops once

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,850
you've exposed this thing as long as the

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,920
functionality is the same you can go

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,470
exchange entire stacks behind it and

00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,900
nobody will know the difference because

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,309
their interface through chat that they

00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,140
don't need to need a client for you

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:46,760
don't give them any other than the

00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,320
actual thing to log into chat which

00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,010
probably is installed by corporate

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,240
policy they have nothing and their

00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:57,920
barrier to get started with doing

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,540
complex things is minimal very small now

00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,210
why this is important is because this is

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,220
where Conway's law comes into play

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,710
Conway's laws tells us that the the

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,000
structure of software starts to model

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,610
the communication structures that we're

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,410
actually using in real life and so it's

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,880
real important to make sure that you're

00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,950
not you're not shooting yourself in the

00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,920
foot in the future right that you're not

00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,500
hard coding these language features into

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,030
how you model chat ups right because

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,650
suddenly if you need to change and you

00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,840
need to pivot what's going to end up

00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:29,720
happening is that all this hard coded

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,660
language that you've codified suddenly

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,520
inhibits you from changing because now

00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,190
your users are expecting a certain

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,870
interface right so you just have to be

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,450
real conscious because the interface

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:48,080
that users are having and not just

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:54,410
admins developers non IT personnel VPS

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:56,660
right think about them use standard

00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,760
interfaces this is kind of a relatively

00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,370
simple one and the reason I just kind of

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,660
bring this up is because when I see some

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,400
chops implementations they're kind of

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,710
all over the place with how you call

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,540
them and how you prioritize them and how

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,400
you leverage them in chat and I say all

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,840
over the place these chat ups commands

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,280
you know I've probably seen like four or

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,870
five actual shops doing chat ups for

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,990
real so I don't mean to over exaggerate

00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:20,660
but the concept being again consistency

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:24,320
for your users the chat client is their

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,240
UI their interface is that little text

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,620
box where they type commands in if they

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,870
have to remember some Delta between

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,220
calling one chat ops command one way and

00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,059
another chat ups command another way

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,320
well again that's friction

00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,789
and that's more effort that you're

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,639
having to give to them in order to make

00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:40,289
this successful so sticks to pick

00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:43,110
something whatever that format is and

00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:45,269
stick with it I like the command tree

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:47,159
with parameters view of the world right

00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:49,139
here's the command I want to run here's

00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,409
the sub command and any attributes that

00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:54,179
I'm going to pass on to it it's my

00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:58,200
preference it's built into stack storm

00:24:54,179 --> 00:25:00,080
I'll loot to that later too and this is

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,549
also a big thing right help comes first

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,470
and this is kind of contradictory to

00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,999
pretty much everything that every

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,950
operations or developer person has ever

00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:10,529
done right whoever writes documentation

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,539
first nobody's handling either you see

00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:14,399
that right nobody because it's not fun

00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:17,039
is not enjoy whatever whatever the

00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:19,190
reason it is right but this is how

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:23,249
discoverability occurs which had ups

00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:25,830
because to a user has their interfacing

00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:27,360
with the chat ops as far as they're

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:31,230
concerned it's just another person on

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,820
the team and I don't just like you know

00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,429
when I need something from somebody I go

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:40,559
up and ask them a question hey how do I

00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:42,960
do x hey how do I do why well that's our

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,059
behavior and we should expect that same

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,129
behavior to be reflected in how we

00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:49,889
leverage our bot so I should be able to

00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:52,019
say hey but how do i go to x how do i go

00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:54,570
do y how do i go proficient a server how

00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:57,649
we crew my graphs whatever maybe has to

00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:02,039
be first so folks know how to consume it

00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:03,840
right and then give it character right

00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,679
this is another kind of one of those

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:12,419
cultural mind hacks if you will um Hugh

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:15,509
bought at github is a jerk I'm just real

00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,850
jerk he would insult you randomly he

00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:19,379
would he would oh my gosh she would tell

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,110
you bad things if you typed in commands

00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:23,369
wrong I certainly put pop in funny jokes

00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,769
from here in a time to time but he had a

00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:28,259
character and we knew Hugh bot was going

00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:29,759
to be a jerk figure out what you want

00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:31,499
your company's character to be with your

00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,299
bot and give it to it so when you're

00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:35,759
typing commands back out about error

00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:38,700
messages or whatnot don't put air 30 for

00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,679
725 you know missing whatever or dump

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,269
the exception into a chat room right

00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,620
make it human give it words that matter

00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:48,960
to people

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,780
this failed because I screwed up right I

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,240
the bot okay cool what does that

00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,370
actually mean that still is a mind

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,780
trigger for folks right giving it

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,000
character so it doesn't feel like a

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,800
computer feels like a member of the team

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,140
it feels like somebody who's going to

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,250
help them and not inhibit them feels

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,070
like somebody who's going to give them

00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,740
power right think about the person who

00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,390
you rely on most for advice when you go

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:17,430
ask them what do you expect back from

00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:20,760
them codify it and this is this is a

00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:23,580
huge thing we talked earlier about how

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,040
do I train new team members so one of

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,980
the hidden benefits of chat ops is that

00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,860
we get to leverage this idea that we as

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,929
humans have been doing for a long time

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,960
depending on you know how long you you

00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:39,090
believe the earth is old right as long

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,700
as humans been around we give oral

00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,050
tradition to folks right written text

00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,150
has only been around for so long and

00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:48,690
even when we try to write documentation

00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,870
in the IT world it's out of date the

00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,790
minute you hit save right out of date

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,620
and so all those things that you're

00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,030
shipping around and the playbooks that

00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,380
you're trying to do to keep people up to

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,630
date about how to do operational tasks

00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,480
they're out of date and maintaining them

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:05,190
becomes a full-time job but if you

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,860
really take the chat ops methodology on

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:11,870
and you use a chat client that you're

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:15,570
either forcing all history to be in or

00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:17,429
records all history for you onboarding a

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,809
new employee or remembering how to do

00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,250
something or looking for something

00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:22,350
complex becomes just as easy as

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,690
searching through the history for

00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,309
somebody else executing the command

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,840
which is very similar to kind of oral

00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:30,120
tradition remembering how people did

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,250
things in the past right I don't have to

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,590
teach somebody because you just say

00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,390
here's the place to search for it and it

00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,770
more or less becomes automatic how did

00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:42,360
you rerun that command when we had that

00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:44,280
outage it's like it comes in bursts

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,040
maybe it's like Sun waves I don't know

00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,900
um but you get these you now I can just

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,940
point them at the history and they can

00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,710
go in and look and figure out okay this

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,590
is how I go do these things right

00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:59,310
onboarding becomes super easy first day

00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,570
github deploy code not not not figure

00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:03,620
out what's going on when

00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:06,720
it's deploy a new feature to the website

00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,580
totally inconceivably done unless i had

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,990
something like this they just drop me in

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,330
front of a terminal and said see what

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,940
you can figure out and you just watch

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:17,610
for a little bit right you watch people

00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,830
do operations and then you kind of seem

00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,269
like oh all i can do that then you look

00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,130
through history and see how historically

00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:25,500
things have done this and why this is

00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:28,320
important is because now all of this

00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,720
work that you have been doing is now

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,429
brought into these conversations that

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,230
you're already having so the context of

00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:37,049
the work you're already doing is now in

00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,070
line with the actions that you're taking

00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,559
as a result of that there's not

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,690
different places of data store for this

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,240
in an email or ticketing system it's

00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,409
pretty much a linear view of history

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,070
including the commands that will run and

00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:53,669
the output of that immensely cool for

00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:55,980
like incident management reports let's

00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:58,860
see trying to figure out again training

00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:01,620
purposes all of these are hugely just

00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,759
for free I'll benefit a chat-up so make

00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,330
sure that when you're implementing this

00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,919
use a client or a service or put

00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:11,399
something in that records all of history

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:14,720
and make it available to your users okay

00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:17,070
so basic design now let's talk about

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,440
iteration and while I do this I actually

00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,610
kind of want to I want to see if my demo

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,909
is going to work so let's let's try

00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:26,549
something here I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:29,429
provision some new nodes so we did a

00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:31,590
demo recently where Rackspace had come

00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:35,250
up to us and said we want to chat ops

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,139
auto scaling and they left it at that

00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,179
what does that mean we want to chat up

00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:40,830
the auto scaling okay well that could

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,929
mean and many things but for in the

00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:45,509
context of rackspace it means they need

00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:47,220
to add a dns they need to add some load

00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:49,379
balancer they need to add create new

00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:53,580
nodes they need to add the dns for those

00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:55,320
things into into the dns records all

00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,559
these things right and they needed to

00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,840
happen with one command right and they

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,669
had all they had was an API available to

00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:09,659
us and so we took it and we said let's

00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:12,470
go create a new autoscale group what are

00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,470
we oh s DC

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,620
right you type in a command and then

00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,780
suddenly things start to happen right

00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,340
the bot receives this command figures

00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,200
out what needs to occur as a result of

00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,630
it goes and starts to provision some new

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,180
nodes and the all the while tells you

00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:31,330
about the status of these things there

00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,220
we go right so now the bots got some

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,350
command and is going to go do all these

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,810
things so while this is happening we're

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,820
going to go back to our talk talk about

00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,990
iteration will come back to this okay so

00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,340
right now what's happening is a bunch of

00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,940
things are being created very excited

00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:50,920
about this so now let's talk about

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:54,700
iteration we talk about billing small

00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:58,030
things right start small even micro to

00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:00,130
that build passive things right your

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,590
first job should not be give the ability

00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:06,460
to delete a my sequel server to anybody

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:08,020
right or delete delete just just remove

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,910
that word from your vocabulary for very

00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,890
early on right give passive task to

00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:15,610
people let people get used to the idea

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:18,670
of consuming information from chat open

00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:22,270
tickets in your ticket base open alerts

00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:25,600
in your alerting base right commonly go

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:28,570
search for glogs from your spunk cluster

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,450
or your log stash cluster go get graphs

00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:34,180
go do something passive and something

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,010
where they can get information you'll do

00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,650
this a couple times and folks will start

00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:40,540
to say okay cool this bot is useful to

00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,950
me because I ask it for things and so

00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,360
the day will actually go do things for

00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,430
them they'll just their mind will be

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,320
blown right oh this thing that just told

00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,550
me information like the weather is now

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,210
suddenly provisioning entire auto

00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:54,460
scaling groups cool okay so we talked

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:57,040
about these like open tickets query

00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,560
alerting issues acknowledged alerts is a

00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,870
good one query data whatever right

00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,780
passive tasks don't give anything

00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,400
destructive day one day 30 whatever that

00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,440
may mean for you you'll pretty much feel

00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,940
you get a feel for your users as they

00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,230
start to actually consume this that it's

00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,860
star them time to start introducing

00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:17,500
destructive tasks okay but start small

00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,330
now why this is really cool is now

00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,040
you're building these small tasks you're

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,470
going to start like accumulating these

00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:27,649
things right the auto scaling tasks to

00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:30,360
go create new services go go

00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:33,360
change bgp routes whatever that may mean

00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,789
all these are consuming and it come up

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,659
with some amount of small primitives

00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:41,190
create a VM create DNS set up create a

00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,830
new load balancer whatever these may

00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:46,259
mean for you these primitives start to

00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:48,749
add up so don't build giant workflows

00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:51,269
that go do massive tasks build very

00:33:48,749 --> 00:33:53,100
small tasks think UNIX methodology very

00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:55,440
small things do one thing really well

00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,450
and chain them together so these

00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,990
primitives that then become consumable

00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,759
by other folks right this is key this is

00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:05,190
part of the collaboration you want other

00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:08,040
folks who are building upon chat ups to

00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:09,780
consume and use your chat ups kind of

00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,089
meta there but if you make it too

00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,760
complicated and too overloaded with

00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:16,740
special edge cases and whatnot again

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,210
folks who you want to consume it or

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,700
develop against it they're not going to

00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:25,079
so build small primitives around

00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:27,780
self-service tasks provision a server

00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,849
query log point application whatever

00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,679
that may mean the end state should be

00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,480
these things but the things that you

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,190
create the action to create small

00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:40,050
primitives ok Sheppard your subject

00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,790
matter experts also another one right

00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,589
your subject matter experts aren't going

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,899
to know how to write for this thing or

00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:49,290
even how to do this thing because it's

00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:51,480
not their job or whatever their excuse

00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,800
maybe but you want that knowledge out of

00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,780
their head so that everybody else

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,700
consumed it can consume it that means

00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,740
you as the folk who wants to try to help

00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,720
and make cultural change need to like

00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,760
actually put in the effort to say here's

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,000
what it means to consume chat ups how

00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,880
can I help you help me write help you

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,530
help me and help them along that path

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,599
here's how to create a good chat ups

00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,270
command here's what success looks like

00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,339
here's what I can actually use from you

00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:20,089
if you could do these 5 things for me in

00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:22,140
your domain and networking or sequel or

00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:23,339
application or whatever that may mean if

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,579
you did those things that would make my

00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:28,349
life tremendously easier go help them do

00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:32,790
this right Sheppard the subject matter

00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:36,569
experts and this is also key never

00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:37,530
explain just do it somebody's going to

00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:39,839
come up to you and you're going to have

00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,600
chat apps commands and they're going to

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,890
say

00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:47,890
hey Bob Bob of course everybody's Bob

00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:50,170
hey Bob I need you to go create a new

00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,250
user for me instead of saying hey you

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,710
can you know you could type this command

00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,740
in and then it would do it for you just

00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,510
do it cool well what happens is they see

00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,710
that and they are cool they just pretty

00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:01,180
much ignore it thank you for creating

00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,970
that account for me I'm gonna go off

00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,840
into my do my thing and inevitably

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,340
they're going to come back and are gonna

00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,860
say hey can you create an account for me

00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,900
you can say it I mean do it again and

00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,490
again and again it's gonna take a little

00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,730
bit of time but eventually you're gonna

00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:18,160
come up with say hey you know Bob I

00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:19,780
noticed that every time that I say hey

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,160
can you get a new user you type this

00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:28,930
command in can do you think I could do

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,670
that yes yes do it do it right now and

00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,430
do it right in front of them right and

00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:35,440
let them do it right the knowledge and

00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,910
power right give that self empowerment

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,830
you're trying to give them back the

00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,810
power which means they need to take it

00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:44,380
but you have to show them how to do it

00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:46,300
don't tell them show them show them how

00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,490
to be successful and they'll grab it

00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,200
right it also helps with the adaptation

00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,180
you're not shoving something down their

00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,740
throats suddenly they just see that your

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,330
job is made easier by talking to this

00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:58,480
bot they're going to come up to you and

00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:00,850
say hey can the bot do things for me yes

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,280
it can how can I help you then you sub

00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:05,080
you Shepherd them you help them build

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,700
the primitives and then everybody gets

00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,440
the power and these are the mine hacks

00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,540
you have to play right because these are

00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,920
cultural changes you're making right all

00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:14,170
these are focused around communication

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,430
around the tools all these tools that

00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,990
you have in your environment they're

00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,640
focused around the human interactions

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,650
and communications associated with

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,720
executing these commands in the shared

00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:26,800
context of the chat room so you know I'm

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,300
sure you're thinking like there's

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,370
there's got to be some problems with

00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,200
this why why is it that the four people

00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:34,570
in this room who have never heard of

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,870
chat ups why aren't they doing it right

00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:39,190
well there are some pitfalls there that

00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,320
your star right you got to be aware of

00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,390
them so let me see if I can answer a few

00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:47,460
of them before we get too far and then

00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:49,360
certainly ask some more confidence

00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,680
guarantee you're going to run into it

00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,540
right people are not going to have

00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,590
confidence in what you're doing people

00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,580
aren't going to have confidence in this

00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,690
bot people

00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,240
going to have confidence in automation

00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:00,100
whatever that may mean I like to tell

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,620
this story that there's a standard bell

00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,630
curve of people when it comes to

00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,790
technology there will be some amount ten

00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,140
to twenty percent on this far end that

00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,490
are always going to get it that are

00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,690
always going to be on the upper curve

00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,150
they're always going to want to be on

00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,530
that bleeding edge on the back end of

00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,420
that there's ten to twenty percent of

00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:18,790
folks that will never want to do it for

00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,860
whatever reason doesn't even matter they

00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,450
will never be on your side just go to

00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,640
how you know it's you know the person

00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,400
came to your mind right away right then

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,470
there's everybody else and this is like

00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,440
the big sixty to seventy percent of

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:35,080
people that are just kind of watching

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,930
trying to figure out what's happening so

00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:40,780
you have to build confidence by doing

00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,370
things according to your culture right

00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,590
you're going to get a feel for how and

00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:46,480
when people will accept new commands

00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:49,000
right you drop the first command that's

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,650
passive in and people start consuming

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,060
and then drop the second command let's

00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,430
pass them people start consuming if you

00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,880
go too fast and you introduce too much

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:59,740
change you will get rebellion you will

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,170
get folks not having confidence in your

00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,270
automation solution you will get folks

00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,330
you want to start building upon this and

00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,890
creating even more complex workflows

00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:10,930
well chat ups also helps with this too

00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,000
because those primitives you've been

00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,460
creating are now being executed in the

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,910
context of chat ups hopefully all day

00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,500
every day by all of your users and so

00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:22,900
those primitives they get battle-tested

00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,250
is it going to work where are the edge

00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,930
cases you're going to be able to program

00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,660
those things out and figure out what

00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,070
makes sense for you so when you go to

00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,480
start building those really strong and

00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,590
complex workflows and somebody says you

00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,480
know I'm not sure if that's going to

00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,280
work you can basically point all the

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,770
primitives in the list that comp that

00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,440
comprises this workflow and say look all

00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:44,080
of these do and their failure rate is 0

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,990
point two percent I'm pretty sure

00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:51,390
chained together they're gonna work you

00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:51,390
build confidence right build confidence

00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:57,730
second one is slow uptake right it's

00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,490
going to feel slow as molasses as you do

00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,960
this right again this is a cultural

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,730
change it's not a technology change

00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,100
you're introducing a technology but a

00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,810
core it's a cultural change and so you

00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,380
might get upset you might get frustrated

00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,640
that

00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,410
folks aren't using my awesome new chat

00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,420
ops interface no one's careering

00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,309
commands through my chat room why am I

00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:18,430
the only one doing this right it give it

00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:20,140
time it will happen right this is also a

00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:22,750
good time to list your first follower

00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,690
right so the first follower concept is

00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:27,400
is as soon as the first follower occurs

00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,500
people will see that happening be okay

00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,319
with it and start going find your

00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:34,809
advocates within your organization and

00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:37,150
make some followers right focus on them

00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:40,869
shepherding them into this concept of

00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:42,430
chat ups right and help them go be

00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:45,339
advocates for you right don't be the

00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,019
only person saying this is awesome but

00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:51,940
be okay and be aware that it's going to

00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:55,509
take some time and this is the big one

00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:57,549
access control so suddenly I'm giving

00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:59,230
all these really complex commands to I

00:40:57,549 --> 00:41:01,359
don't know everybody in the organization

00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,309
or everybody who has access to this chat

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,549
room that sounds like a fantastic idea

00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:09,789
doesn't it this is actually kind of a

00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:12,309
problem now I'll be frank with you Lita

00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:13,660
and a fundamentally do not have prob

00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:15,579
solutions to this you're basically

00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,230
anything you give to those chat chat

00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:18,250
BOTS you're going to cross your fingers

00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,720
and you're going to either have to write

00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,819
some middle layer yourself in order to

00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:26,410
do access control or be ok with the

00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:27,940
concept of giving access to everybody my

00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,980
experiences in Germany say it's the

00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,539
ladder not the former I'm glad you guys

00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:35,259
are security conscious right so keep

00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:37,509
that in mind Hugh bot has a Rolls

00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:39,400
pattern where you can like delineate who

00:41:37,509 --> 00:41:40,660
has access to run certain commands so

00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,519
get you some basic level of access

00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,279
control but it doesn't tie in with any

00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:46,960
of your heavy hitting like actual

00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:49,900
repositories of access and like ldap

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,000
right this is actually a problem this

00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,650
tax storms trying to solve so stack

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,210
storm wants to sit on top of all these

00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:57,009
tools your Hugh bought your Lita and

00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,960
your earth and provide that layer of

00:41:57,009 --> 00:42:01,269
access control so we're not done with it

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,799
yet or heavily working on it but you

00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,569
gotta care about this right you don't

00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:06,400
want everybody to say delete everything

00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:07,900
when you go to start introduce delete

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,049
commands maybe you only want to do it to

00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,759
a subset of users right but be aware of

00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:14,890
that right be aware that access control

00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:16,930
is a thing do your research and figure

00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:18,700
out what works for you right it may be

00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:20,980
that it's okay to start out with a

00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,270
completely open system because your beta

00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,610
internally is only

00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:25,840
be a handful of people anyway all right

00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:29,440
but keep that in mind as you're building

00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,300
it's going to come up and then

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,490
acceleration so the kind of last phase

00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:41,380
of this thing right basically the idea

00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:43,150
here is now that you've got chat ups you

00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,890
can start to do the real big things okay

00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:47,050
so let's advance in time a little bit

00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:49,860
we've now have chat ops we've got it in

00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:52,300
our organization everybody's loving it

00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:55,030
now it's time to really start advancing

00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,520
it right because it turns out chat is

00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,470
just a different kind of bus right it's

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,090
just a much slower bus has a lot of

00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,570
latency because there's humans

00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:06,940
associated with it but in the concept

00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:09,190
the event being emitted from your chat

00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:12,030
client into some system to take in

00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:15,400
action is basically event-driven

00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:17,320
operations an event occurs I want this

00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,460
thing to occur I've asked the bot to do

00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,240
it the block goes and does something

00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:25,450
event done but this is where you get to

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,010
start create feedback loops okay so you

00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,360
have some action you've done this and

00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:31,690
normally at the end you just celebrate

00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,430
and go get a beer well as you're going

00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,990
and getting a beer tell the bot here's

00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:36,490
what to do with this data that now that

00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:37,840
it's come in and here are the extra

00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,000
actions I want to have it associated

00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,190
with it don't just be okay with creating

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,590
the ticket create the ticket notify

00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,970
somebody through pagerduty actually do

00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:48,460
the destructive action that's necessary

00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:50,710
whatever that means start creating your

00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,690
feedback loops because now that you've

00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:55,450
built confidence in your chat up system

00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:57,100
people are used to this bot dropping

00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:59,710
into your room and just doing random

00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,810
things hey guy hey Bob I just rebooted

00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:04,090
this server just so you know hey Bob I

00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:05,800
just changed our bgp we're out cool

00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:07,420
people will get used to this the bot

00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,030
coming in and dropping knowledge on them

00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,890
because they've been consuming data then

00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,870
they've been using it to make their

00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,730
lives better through self-service so

00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,410
it's not that big of a jump to get to

00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,750
the point where you actually want to be

00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:21,850
where the bot is doing everything that's

00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,710
where I want to be I really don't want

00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:25,510
to work I want to go to a be a beach I

00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,640
want to drink some beer and I want a

00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:29,290
happy happy right I hope all of you want

00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,610
something similar to that but in order

00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,040
to do that we actually have to get

00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,660
hardco over the automations right and

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,040
that means as soon as you teach the bot

00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,550
to do something

00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,170
try to teach you how to be reactive

00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:43,000
right another thing stack storms trying

00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,460
to solve try not to pimp stacks from too

00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,230
much we're big on workflow right so as

00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,090
after you have an action something

00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,580
workflow needs to happen after that in

00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:53,200
order to execute ah this one event

00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,930
happen I need to go actually do 30 more

00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:00,090
things how are you going to do that

00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:02,110
create the feedback loops so real quick

00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,600
since we've done this let's look at our

00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:07,630
demo how am i doing on time doing okay

00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,400
on time so here's our history right so

00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,350
we did some chat-up scommn and and i

00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,090
asked the bot hey go create a new auto

00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,650
scaling group for me and it said hey no

00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,270
problem I'll go create a new auto

00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:19,150
scaling group create your new load

00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:21,550
bouncer or create a new DNS zone here's

00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:23,800
some new knowns whiner unavoidably oh

00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,420
that's so good I just random name

00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,980
generator for my nodes and sometimes it

00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:32,050
comes up with the best that's so great

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,820
created a new node added to DNS adds it

00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:36,280
to the load bouncer and all I had to do

00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,530
is continue to talk to you and work was

00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,230
happening in the back end right the

00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:44,950
power of this comes when you give this

00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:48,280
to your VP or CEO and he does this or

00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:50,290
she does this because that's what

00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,870
happens we have our CEO going to

00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,940
investors going check out how powerful I

00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:59,050
can be and type in a command from his

00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:02,260
phone and this stuff happens that's real

00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,820
power okay now let's talk about some

00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:08,590
other real world examples I've got a

00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:11,680
couple there is colleague of mine his

00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:14,560
name's James White he is subscribes to

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,540
the concept of lazy administrator he is

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,040
the laziest administrator I've ever met

00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,260
and that doesn't mean he sits and does

00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,970
nothing it means he works his butt off

00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:23,860
in order to get to the point where he

00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:25,390
can sit and do nothing now that never

00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:28,210
the nothing never happens but you know

00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:29,860
it's a good goal right and so one day

00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,860
he's sitting around in his chat room and

00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:34,510
he's got CSRs non technical personnel

00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,920
coming in and saying hey I need to know

00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:38,350
some information about these printers

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,580
that were selling as a service these

00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,290
printers needed to know whether they

00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:43,510
were up whether they had appropriate

00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,070
supplies they were basically printing

00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,360
credit cards and they developed a

00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,950
service where they sent this little box

00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,480
to a bank instead of waiting the

00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,900
obligatory three to five days to get a

00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,010
new car

00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,810
when you lose it or create a new account

00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:55,210
they just printed you one right there

00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,260
pretty cool but the CSRs would always

00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,370
come in and say what's the status of

00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,860
this what's the status of this what's

00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:01,420
the status of this well going back to

00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,400
these concepts these fundamentals about

00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,170
design and iteration he went through his

00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,030
history and took a look at the different

00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:09,040
ways people asked him the question he's

00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:10,750
a date came out to be about nine ways

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,910
they asked the same question and he

00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,620
codified it in chat ups and then one day

00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,450
when they dropped into the room and they

00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:19,740
asked hey James what is the status of

00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:22,870
blah the bot answered and they went ah

00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:27,580
and he never had to answer that question

00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:29,290
again that's power though right is now

00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:31,060
those CSRs are no longer encumbered by

00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,770
the IT department they're actually

00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,330
accelerated by it because they're able

00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,610
to leverage the technology that the

00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:39,340
business is using to make their business

00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:41,380
better and it's not a burden to them it

00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:47,380
is frictionless they're able to consume

00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:49,600
super powerful another story this one

00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:52,450
happened in github my colleague mark

00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,220
embryo was on his way to velocity to

00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:56,560
speak about chat ups because you know

00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,380
it's a real powerful concept and on the

00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:03,940
way he gets a phone call says dude we're

00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:07,210
under a ddos yolo right so you know

00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:09,190
normally as the incident commander you

00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:10,360
get a call like that everything stops

00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,950
you're going to stop whatever you're

00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,510
doing if you're in a taxi you ripping a

00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:16,870
phone and computer out whatever that

00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:19,240
means it's all hands on deck he pulled

00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:21,310
out his phone typed in one command and

00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,230
put his phone away and what happened was

00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,460
called other people that were on call

00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,290
just to let them know that this thing

00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,350
had happened notify their upstream

00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:30,970
providers initiated a BGP change created

00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,950
and started an incident log to track

00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,690
what was happening track performance

00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:36,040
metrics all that you know what was going

00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:37,990
on and dumped them into chat every so

00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,300
often all this happened from his phone

00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:42,280
in one command bgp routes entirely

00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,960
changed you telling network person that

00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,240
they're going to flip out you're gonna

00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:50,740
let a bot touch my bgp routes no thank

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:53,620
you yes thank you please right because

00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:55,030
now my power I don't have to wait for

00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,560
the netops guy to get on the phone call

00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,470
so we can mitigate this deed us because

00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,970
we're losing mint dollars a second I

00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:03,550
type the command in and the power that's

00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:05,410
been codified is now mine to leverage

00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,720
he doesn't get woken up at 3am in the

00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:12,880
morning I get to go to sleep faster all

00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:14,440
everybody wins everybody wins so let's

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,000
talk about going further right this is

00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,500
not just an operations thing you're

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,850
thinking I know and I hope that you're

00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,950
thinking about how you make your day to

00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:23,470
day life and your team members life

00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:25,840
better by doing this but remember this

00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:27,520
is not just an operations thing you're

00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,490
introducing a cultural change and you

00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,500
can and should extend it further than

00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:35,740
your immediate boundary include the

00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,870
business because remember DevOps is a

00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,250
business problem it's not a technology

00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:42,160
problem as much as we talk about the

00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:44,200
tools DevOps fundamentally at core is a

00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,640
business problem how do you make sure

00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,920
that the efforts that we're putting in

00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,380
are actually providing real-world value

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,670
to the business because it's one thing

00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,830
to sit in a corner and go I'll look at

00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,790
my cool Korres cluster it's well it's

00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,680
another thing that's go look at this

00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:58,510
cool core OS cluster that's serving

00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:03,100
hundreds of thousands of requests and my

00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:06,220
CEO can operate it well right to totally

00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:07,420
fundamental things and you have to build

00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,710
this confidence right we've talked about

00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,990
this over and over and over again

00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:13,870
confidence matters and building chat ups

00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:16,180
commands so that's really much more all

00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,770
I have to say about it I mean not

00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,960
generally I have a lot to say about this

00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,610
if you're interested in talking more

00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,890
about it I really do love talking about

00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:26,500
it most everywhere online i'm known as

00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,970
jay Fryman including twitter and if you

00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,710
have this email thing which is you know

00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:31,450
this old archaic thing send me a note

00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:34,660
I'm more than happy to talk to you about

00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:36,550
it and we're also on IRC right so I hang

00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,500
out in stack storm channel all the time

00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:40,240
we are literally trying to solve this

00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:43,120
problem how do you make chat ups

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:46,000
accessible to the masses easy to consume

00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,800
and paired with work flow right we're

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,480
not taking over your tools we just want

00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,920
to enhance them so if you're interested

00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,960
in learning more about that head to our

00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,880
website learn more about it and I'm

00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,500
always happy to talk about it so with

00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:02,650
that thank you very much for inviting me

00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:04,250
any questions I hope maybe it was that

00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:24,860
good yes

00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:26,060
Kelsey sure absolutely right so there

00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,920
are some of those right you're going to

00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,840
get noisy chat rooms and noisy access so

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,960
for the most part you there's two ways

00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,670
to associate this right or a couple ways

00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,900
way number one is you start to split out

00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:37,190
your rooms that are bought traffic

00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,230
versus human traffic so at some point

00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:40,820
that actually does matter right you're

00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,470
going to have you know chat clients they

00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,840
can open multiple panes at a time so the

00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:46,190
the log stays relatively in history but

00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,080
there's so much happening with the bots

00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:49,190
that you need to know that the the

00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,110
communication channels differ a little

00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,730
bit the other way to do that is to

00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:54,410
leverage some sort of paste bin service

00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,820
right where instead of like letting the

00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,620
chat client expand those things you just

00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,970
drop the link in there and if the chat

00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,950
client expands it well that's really on

00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:02,600
the user you've at least provided some

00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:05,000
sort of shortening place where that data

00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,560
actually cares about some s3 bucket some

00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,270
internal github server whatever that may

00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:11,000
be in order to make sure that that

00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:13,310
doesn't flood your channel there's

00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,440
probably other ways right but we've seen

00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:17,420
the scale pretty big right beyond you

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,300
know tens of users into the hundreds and

00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:21,710
thousands of users so really again kind

00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,660
of falling back to Conway's law it's

00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:25,730
about how your communication structures

00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:29,330
or happen so if you find yourself being

00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:30,950
encumbered by the the noise you know

00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:36,370
you'll find a pretty clear way to split

00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:36,370
out yes sir

00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:47,280
yeah you create the frictionless

00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:49,230
necessity for them to be in one room

00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,700
over the other you limit the chat

00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:53,310
commands that would be important to that

00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,410
conversation to specific rooms so you're

00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:56,940
forcing them like you're introducing a

00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:58,140
slight amount of friction that friction

00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,940
being you have to be in this place to

00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,710
talk about it but that's the most amount

00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,820
of friction you introduce you execute

00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:04,080
this command and one chat room and says

00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:07,020
hey you really should be in this room

00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,700
I'll go do it but I'm not going to tell

00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,200
you about it or I'm not even going to do

00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:15,680
this go execute it in this other room so

00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:15,680
everybody else can see it yes I

00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:33,960
currently am on pardon me on the core no

00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,260
it's not feasible right so Hugh bot

00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,950
command or lead a command command is

00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,270
transactional right as soon as that

00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,920
transaction is done it doesn't really

00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:44,100
have any state or knowledge of the

00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:46,950
conversation you're having I can't say

00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:48,690
on the stacks stacks stacks storm this

00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,310
is the company i support stack storm

00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,870
side we actually do have kind of a

00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,520
concept of state storage so you can

00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:55,440
maintain some amount of state around a

00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,700
person or a conversation so you can do

00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,470
challenge response or things like that

00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,210
like hey you want to execute this really

00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:05,780
complex command why don't you confirm

00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:05,780
that for me stuff like that yes sir

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:16,410
sure I just realized I'm not repeating

00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:18,540
the questions I'm sorry so the question

00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:20,610
was how do you not get distracted why

00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:22,440
does that matter you've accelerated

00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:25,460
their work by providing commands to be

00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,870
faster let them slack that's a reward

00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,120
like I think I think it's important from

00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:32,790
a cultural perspective to have things in

00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,890
that make work fun chat ups makes work

00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:37,020
fun and it even accelerates work so it

00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:38,790
becomes okay to get to a point where you

00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,680
drop a silly cat photo in because it's

00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:42,930
really hard and you're really stressed

00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,250
right now well that's okay like slack

00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:46,260
off a little bit right don't be so

00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:47,910
stressed they're just computers right

00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,290
and so that's the point I want to convey

00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,880
is I don't think there will always be

00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:52,800
some amount of people going to slack off

00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,390
in interface with the bots right but

00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,010
that's not a bot problem that's more of

00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:58,350
an HR problem but in general I actually

00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:00,840
do believe that it's important to like

00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:03,540
introduce that fun and let that occur

00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,890
let the encourage kind of laziness

00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,540
because it will encourage them to put

00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:23,820
things into chat up so they can be lazy

00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:26,880
that makes any sense yes sir I don't

00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,810
know like that's a good question I don't

00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,090
think I've ever run into the problem

00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:33,480
where somebody doesn't want to be seen

00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:35,190
doing chat ops work right like most of

00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,380
the things that are exposed via chat ops

00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,730
are things that need to be collaborated

00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,050
and communicated about anyway we're

00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:44,100
going to have these conversations the

00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:46,080
Comanche supplements those things you

00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,760
know I the way I would solve that if

00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,110
there were a concern about that is there

00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,670
are commands that I want to be

00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:52,110
transparent right and this is actually a

00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,460
bit in stack storm that we care about

00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,690
because we do know this right there are

00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,280
some commands that are going to be

00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:59,700
limited to a channel or even limited to

00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:01,800
a user is making it so that commands

00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,970
that need to be exposed are exposed and

00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,470
then commands that don't need to be I

00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:06,330
can just have private conversations with

00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:07,590
the bottle with so like it's a different

00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,570
way to approach it flip the bit a little

00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:11,640
bit right make it so that the things are

00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,350
explicitly defined here's what I care

00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,490
about and the other stuff whatever go

00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:17,130
talk to the bots in your corner if you

00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:18,690
want to another good way is like you're

00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,160
having some channel where the bot just

00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,750
hangs out where I can go get garbage to

00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,130
it I don't know how to use the bot I

00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,340
don't want to be embarrassed like trying

00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,290
to

00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:27,360
asked about questions and in the common

00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:31,650
room where operations is happening go to

00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:38,370
the bottom talk to the bottle yeah what

00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:40,080
else alright so I hope you got 2,500

00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:43,260

00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:45,290
