Title: OSDC 2015: Matthias Klein | How to use OS Software to have near Production Dev. and Testing Envir
Publication date: 2015-04-30
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	This talk is meant to present different (well known) OSS in a bigger context from development to production.
It will cover the following software/concepts:

    apt-mirror - why is it a good idea to have multiple own repositories
    puppet/hiera - the tool that glues everything together
    vagrant - create production like machines for developers in nearly no time
    jenkins - test and build your software
    dpkg-deb - why you should deploy using packages

In this talk Matthias will present the techniques they use to develop and deploy software in some projects. He will describe how all these tools work together at this point in time, which difficulties they have found (vagrant and jenkins didn't work well together) and which improvements are still to be done.

Because of the amount of tools he will talk more about the concepts and ideas behind. He will try to present and explain at least one script we use (most probably the package creation and deployment part). For more technical details he is open to talk to interested people during the breaks / in the evening / later by mail.
