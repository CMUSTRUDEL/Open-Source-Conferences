Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	MQTT is a PUB/SUB protocol for the Internet of Things, but it's also valuable for systems administration and for your data center. We'll take a close look at MQTT and its infrastructure, and we'll show you how to use a microcontroller to monitor your server-room's temperature with it, publishing and monitoring it via MQTT and Icinga/Nagios. Furthermore, we'll also show you some real-world integrations of MQTT and Unix/Linux system utilities.
