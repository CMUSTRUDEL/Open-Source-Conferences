Title: OSDC 2015: Bernd Erk | Why favour Icinga over Nagios
Publication date: 2015-04-30
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Most sys admins have a love-hate relationship with Nagios based monitoring solutions. Backed by a sizable community, users have learned to live with it’s shortcomings in scaling, configuration, and modern integration options.

Taking advantage of the tremendous number of supported hard- and software, Icinga leaves all legacy limitations behind. It delivers an easily scalable solution, with clustering, load balancing, automated replication, and even business process monitoring out-of-the-box. Based on a new configuration format with advanced language features - like conditional processing and complex type support - monitoring agile environments works like a breeze. Existing modules for Puppet, Chef and Ansible ramp up the rollout time and ensure a continuous and up to date monitoring environment.

The talk will demonstrate how popular tools such as Graphite, Logstash, or Graylog integrate better and easier than ever before. In addition to that we’ll introduce the new Icinga Web 2 interface and give a brief introduction into the technical architecture.
