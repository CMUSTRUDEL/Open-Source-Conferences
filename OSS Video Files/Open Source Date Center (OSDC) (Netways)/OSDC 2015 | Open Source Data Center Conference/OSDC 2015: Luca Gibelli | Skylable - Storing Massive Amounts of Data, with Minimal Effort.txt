Title: OSDC 2015: Luca Gibelli | Skylable - Storing Massive Amounts of Data, with Minimal Effort
Publication date: 2015-04-30
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Skylable provides an object storage solution which you can run on your own hardware. It provides data replication, deduplication, client-side encryption, and built-in data integrity checks.
Skylable scales easily to hundreds of TBs and it can be deployed in literally 2 minutes by anyone with a minimal experience of Linux administration.
The installation and setup process is straightforward and requires very few dependencies.
Skylable is fully compatible with Amazon S3 APIs. It also offers a more advanced RESTful protocol called SX, which solves many limitations of the S3 protocol, most importantly the ability to upload/download files in parallel from multiple hosts and true support for resuming transfers.
The software is released under the GPL licence, the client library (libsx) is LGPL.
This talk is about the ease of use of Skylable, a comparison of S3 vs SX and the real-world advantage of doing deduplication and multiplexed transfers.
