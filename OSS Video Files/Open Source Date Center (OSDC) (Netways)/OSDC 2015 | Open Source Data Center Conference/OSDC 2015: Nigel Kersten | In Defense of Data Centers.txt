Title: OSDC 2015: Nigel Kersten | In Defense of Data Centers
Publication date: 2015-04-27
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Modern operations practices and Devops-style methodologies don’t have to require the adoption of public cloud services. For some environments, making a modern data center the core of your operations is the most flexible and appropriate choice if you ensure the implementation of some of the same constraints as the public cloud.
In this talk we’ll sketch out how automated modern operations practices can transform your operational efficiency in data centers without necessarily requiring the use of public cloud, private cloud, or even virtualization.

	00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:13,000
so my name is Nigel Kirsten and I run

00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:15,689
operations like sis ops internal IT and

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,669
business operations at puppet labs and

00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:20,320
yeah it's really great to be here I

00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:22,720
always love a good excuse to come to

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,519
Berlin I really love electronic music

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,800
and so if me you know Berlin feels like

00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,660
the spiritual home of techno and so I

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,759
always have really good reasons to try

00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,190
and stay the extra weekend and hopefully

00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,449
you'll see a few synthesizers coming

00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,920
along in the theme here so I'm not going

00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:39,940
to try and sell you anything here at all

00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,589
you know this is an open source

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,350
conference but I'm not even really here

00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:47,019
today as you know puppet labs the pop of

00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,549
the open source project I'm definitely

00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:51,070
not trying to sell you anything I'm here

00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:53,320
I guess more of as a user we've sort of

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,089
growin pretty hugely I guess in last few

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,190
years and we're now nearly 400 people

00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:58,809
we've got officers in london and sydney

00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,659
and stockholm in all these places and

00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,850
iran internal IT so i kind of have these

00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:05,860
problems as well and we're that size of

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,630
a company of developers going crazy

00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,580
using cloud services and suddenly the

00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,740
bills coming in every month and we're

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,700
trying to do that sort of work out you

00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,020
know what's the best way to build

00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,729
infrastructure where should we do it

00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,619
inside the data center where should we

00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,750
let people use the cloud how can we give

00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,640
people guardrails and how can we kind of

00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,350
do it without without saying no to

00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,840
everything because I think this is sort

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:30,070
of the old way of doing operations in

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,869
many ways so I wanted to ask a few

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,560
questions so get an idea of where your

00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:37,749
lap who runs all their infrastructure or

00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,450
at least most of their infrastructure in

00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:45,490
their own data centers or kolos or

00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:48,249
server rooms who's running pretty much

00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:55,749
everything in the cloud like public

00:01:48,249 --> 00:02:00,520
cloud services that's pretty cool you'll

00:01:55,749 --> 00:02:06,179
say I have a slide on that well how many

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:10,479
of you work in really big companies okay

00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:11,800
what you think is sort of big how many

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,630
of you still have all your servers on

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,730
like racks and desktops sitting under a

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,280
table somewhere or in a closet rather

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,690
than actually in a Colo it's okay don't

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,120
be ashamed

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,160
it's but that's kind of cool and so I

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,380
think the mix is you know as Chris you

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,730
know pointed out there is kind of a

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,530
difference here between Europe in the US

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,090
and I think some of it comes down to

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,950
trust somebody comes down to like

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,320
different sort of constraints people

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,390
have but there's definitely a whole

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,920
bunch of hype around the cloud and I

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,910
don't think it's you can't really deny

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,380
that there's a whole bunch of things

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,080
that are really really awesome about

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,390
using cloud services for everything but

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,030
in this talk I'm basically going to be

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,220
arguing that I think you can get a lot

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,810
of the advantages of a cloud public

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,820
cloud services in your own data center

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,650
but you've got to do some work to kind

00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:01,690
of get there so I'm not real I'm not a

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,980
cloud hater on the other hand like

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,930
there's lots of things that are really

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,430
really useful about it and I don't know

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,250
if the term cloud washing is something

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,600
you guys are all familiar with but I saw

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,180
this hour day I was visiting a friend

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,940
who's totally not technical and he's

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,200
like I've got a cloud hard drive so puts

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,840
a cloud hard drive he's like oh there it

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,490
is there and he's bought some hard drive

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,940
that markets itself as a cloud hard

00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:27,100
drive because it's got back up and the

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,420
backup goes somewhere else and so I

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,180
think you know the term cloud gets

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,709
completely overused and people abuse it

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,690
in all sorts of ways and just like any

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,880
marketing buzz word whether it be DevOps

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,840
or agile or whatever you're going to

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
have people there who are sort of

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,350
abusing the term for their own sort of

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:46,540
gain but I think there are lots of

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,430
advantages and it's not all just cloud

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,959
washing there are things that are really

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,400
really useful and I think one of the

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,800
cool things about the cloud is it sort

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,780
of forced a mindset change for them for

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,300
those of us who actually run data

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,010
centers so did sort of be transparent

00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,260
here you know we use at pub labs we use

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,910
cloud services we use Amazon a lot we

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,900
use as your we use Google compute not

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,910
just because we partner with those

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,980
people because sometimes it's kind of

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,540
better but on the other hand you know

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,760
you don't necessarily want to give your

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,290
developers and unlimited sort of debit

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,330
card just to keep paying for services

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,370
every single month and a lot of the time

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:22,270
makes sense to just own everything for a

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:24,400
bunch of different reasons the other

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,370
thing I think to point out is the cloud

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,360
is just a bunch is someone else's server

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,770
like there are things that are different

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,690
about it there's different things about

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,220
the way we use it but there's still

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,290
other people's servers

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,550
you know and maybe that's part of the

00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,220
problem there are other people's they're

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,960
not yours but there's things that are

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,190
really really good about the cloud that

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,790
we can implement on our own

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,110
infrastructure really easily I think you

00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,460
know a lot of people have this sort of

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,980
doom and gloom about the state of

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,240
operations and infrastructure going you

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,200
know everything is going to move to the

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,750
cloud and we're just going to end up

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,850
with ninety percent of the world on

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,680
Amazon or on google or whoever it ends

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,390
up being but I really don't think that's

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,530
going to end up being the case I don't

00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,960
think we're going to end up having fewer

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,430
servers if you look at you know five ten

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,380
years ago and you talk to your average

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,150
person and you ask them you thought

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,150
about how many servers they interacted

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,220
with they weren't that many really but

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,960
now you know consumers have all their

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,760
stuff all over the place and they're

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,520
used to consuming services and all of

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,570
those services require servers so I

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,950
don't think there's any world we're

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,200
moving towards where we're going to end

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:32,919
up having fewer servers to have to deal

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:34,750
with does anyone else run this this is a

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,580
really awesome Chrome extension if you

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,130
haven't seen it before and it basically

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,810
every time you surf the internet instead

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:48,550
of the word cloud it just replaces it

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:51,160
with but it's a really nice way of kind

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,960
of puncturing all of that sort of hype

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,100
around things because there's nothing

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,419
that sort of gives you a little bit of

00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,850
Glee like being able to read a press

00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:03,190
release like Microsoft profits slide but

00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:04,510
it's but flourishes the only caveat I

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,070
have there and I think we're not the

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,440
only this became really big at puppet

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,120
labs and everyone installed it and then

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,250
turned out even the marketing people

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,360
we're installing it for a while and then

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:18,310
they were using the content management

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,690
system to write documentation and and it

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,240
will happily replace cloud with but

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,919
anywhere so it was pretty funny seeing

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,600
the gartner and Forrester but reports

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,410
and you know how but expenditures

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,280
planning to increase one things I find

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:35,229
really amusing here is it's actually

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,570
done it in its own project the project's

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:41,400
called cloud debat but it's gone and

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,400
replaced it for itself we'd but about

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,920
so here's a bunch of sort of you know

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,660
you're hearing all this stuff from

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,090
people all over the place you know how

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,560
much cloud expenditures increasing these

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,900
are usual suspects you know it's cisco

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,060
it's Forrester it's computer world it's

00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,530
the industry magazines they're telling

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,420
us people are spending more and more

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,800
money you know they're spending more

00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,600
money on infrastructure in general but

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,160
cloud expenditures exploding and

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,770
billions of dollars are being spent all

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,120
over the place and you know we saw from

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,440
the crowd you know most of you are

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,480
actually running data center stuff

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,280
primarily and not necessarily using the

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,680
cloud I don't think these people are

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,510
stupid you know I think people can be

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,010
stupid but they're not that stupid like

00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,780
there's there's reasons why people do

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,190
this it's not always easy to convince

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,960
businesses to spend money they don't

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:32,710
always do it in a really sort of sane

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,970
and rational sort of way but they're not

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,510
that stupid there's a reason people

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:39,880
adopt all this stuff so what are the

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,400
traditional arguments against cloud you

00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,280
don't have any control anymore it's not

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,980
your stuff it's someone else's server

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,870
you don't get to dictate you know when

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,160
performance happens hardware upgrades

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,480
all of these sorts of things you don't

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,430
necessarily even get to dictate a

00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,980
hypervisor there's all sorts of in

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,140
flexibility with using a cloud you get

00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,760
locked into vendors and I see this a lot

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,740
from people like and I think it's gonna

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,620
be really interesting to see how Cloud

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,030
usage over the next couple years changes

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,520
we're seeing people already going well

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,310
you know I use Amazon but I don't want

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,820
to be all in I don't want to use s3 and

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,830
ec2 and their messaging system and their

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,810
CDN because then you end up in this

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,970
really sort of locked in space and I

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,980
think our industry kind of hates

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,390
monopolies in a way you know we saw in

00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,910
the 90s there was a huge backlash

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,990
against Microsoft sort of having this

00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,790
real monopoly and it didn't really

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,270
create the innovation that we really

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,800
really wanted performance kind of sucks

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,540
how many of you the first time you

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,820
actually did anything with a disk in the

00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,830
cloud went oh my god what is you know

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,860
it's like I've gone back 15 years in

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:49,900
terms of disk i/o performance and cpu

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:52,360
performance it can be pretty crappy it's

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,680
not that cheap like I think this is one

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,250
things I find really frustrating about

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,020
cloud

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,310
angelus they'll sort of push this whole

00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,290
thing of going you know it's micro

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,240
payments but those micro payments keep

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,340
going on and on and on and on and

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,440
there's a difference between spending

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,930
money on hardware and spending money on

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,760
subscription services and there's lots

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,580
of good things about it but these are

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,400
sort of the traditional arguments then

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,530
there's security and there's a bunch of

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,630
reasons why people worry about this

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,060
stuff having single points of contact

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,950
you know for people to be able to

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,960
control the flow of information and

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,190
observe information and it's not that

00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,800
this stuff doesn't happen outside in

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,660
data centers as well but it's really

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,230
really easy if everyone's emails on

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,400
gmail you know to be able to go and get

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,230
various bits of information and I think

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,670
we've all seen you know the US

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,960
government's kind of overreached in a

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,880
whole bunch of ways and it's not just

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,460
them you know it's GCHQ in London

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,800
there's like real concerns here and so

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,070
there's a lot of fear I think you're not

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,330
a lot of arguments against the cloud

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,190
that's kind of not where I'm going

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:56,290
though I don't really want to sit here

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,670
and try and scare you all about cloud

00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,470
services and I don't think any of us

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,120
should be running data centers because

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,390
we're afraid of the options we should

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,440
have a much more sort of positive a true

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,450
that we should be able to you know say

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
what is it we actually want to do rather

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,470
than running away from the things we're

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,850
scared about and I don't think it's a

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,800
binary choice I think there's a real

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,600
spectrum here I think one of the really

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,280
cool things with a lot of the big data

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,560
center providers even the smaller ones

00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,600
is all this sort of functionality that's

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,700
there now that lets you mix and match

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,589
you know if you want to use public cloud

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,180
services because the risk is right for

00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:29,350
you or it's the right kind of

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,839
functionality or you just want to be

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,280
able to burst out you can do that sort

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,230
of stuff really easily it's no longer

00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,020
really the state i think ruin when

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,970
Amazon first launched DC to where you

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,830
were largely on-premise or you are

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,600
largely in the cloud I think those lines

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,210
have gotten much more blurred these days

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,800
and you can submit sand match features

00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,780
from different providers you know we've

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,060
got interconnects we have telcos inside

00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,670
data centers we can you know pay for

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,440
dedicated bandwidth to Salesforce or SI

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,110
p havana or any of these sort of

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,740
services we can pick up things like that

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:05,170
I think fundamentally I'm going to argue

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,850
that I think diversity is good we don't

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,710
want to end up in a situation where we

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,470
have

00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,120
any company kind of controlling one of

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,830
our foundational infrastructure layers

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,270
and I think this is a lot of the fear

00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,100
that happens and I think this is a

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,030
justified for you and it's not just

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,400
because you think they're going to do

00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,440
something wrong I think innovation is

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,700
good you know look at the problems if

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,770
you want to sit there and you like okay

00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,240
well I'm really all in on OpenStack for

00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,460
example because I actually think it's

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,410
going to be really good it's not always

00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,750
easy to layer virtualization like that

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,570
you know like Amazon's largely Zen base

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,710
you don't necessarily have the Intel VT

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,100
performance beds that OpenStack really

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,570
relies upon you can't necessarily

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,430
innovate in the cloud and I think some

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,840
of the constraints and this sort of the

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,270
direction I'm going to go in the

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,550
constraints of the cloud or what sort of

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,250
enable a whole bunch of innovation but

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,420
at the same time I think we need

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,680
multiple solutions around the place and

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,480
I actually think this is where open

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,970
source is so critical in terms of the

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,150
data center because open source projects

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,620
need to glue things together there's a

00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,740
direction that the Internet's going in

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,300
that really worries me where I worry we

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,750
couldn't even invent a protocol like

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,300
smtp or IMAP these days consumers have

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,040
moved to this model of taking they only

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,410
want to pay small amounts for software

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,880
and they prefer to pay for services and

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,260
when services integrate with each other

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,280
they're not always as open as they

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,190
should be particularly not when

00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,660
companies are running them so I really

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,800
sort of worry in some ways about the

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,160
future of the internet we've sort of

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,630
educated our user bases you know you

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,460
shouldn't go out and you know pay a

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,260
bunch of money for a really great client

00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,970
on an open protocol with an open server

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,620
instead we've got all these services

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,900
that are slowly turning into walled

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,350
gardens as they work out how to monetize

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:49,890
different bits of your information so I

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,560
think we need innovation we need we need

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:56,220
lots and lots of options and ultimately

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,840
I think owning the hardware layer gives

00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,920
you a lot of those options and it's not

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,540
always going to be right for everyone

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,500
but I think it's going to be where we're

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,420
going to see a different kind of

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,070
innovation come out if you look at a lot

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,600
of the projects that are you know being

00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,480
talked about here that was covered in

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,860
the workshops yesterday this stuff is

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,410
where lots of innovation is happening

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,420
and it's not just in public cloud and

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,920
it's not just on premise it's about sort

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,630
of opening up protocols and letting

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,050
things talk to each other across those

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,050
boundaries

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:29,100
so why do people do it is a whole bunch

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,540
of definitions of the cloud and I think

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,600
they all sort of sent around a whole

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,610
bunch of things it's on demand you know

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,740
you want something you can go and get it

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,300
it's self service you're not going

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,190
through the bottleneck that I think

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,230
operations and IT people need to kind of

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,210
owned up to that we've kind of been the

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,520
people saying no to our internal users

00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:50,820
and some of the rest of the company in

00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,770
many ways for the last few decades it's

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,260
really convenient users expectations

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:58,020
have changed you know if you want to use

00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,880
is developers go Wow well I could ask

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,530
you to you know file a ticket to get a

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,170
new repository set up with access

00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,880
permissions but they've used github you

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,470
know they've interacted with it and so

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,420
their expectations are different they're

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,150
like why can't you give me this control

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,950
why can't you put it in my hands instead

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,890
of waiting and waiting and being

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,180
ultimately being the person who says no

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,010
this is I talked to a lot of big

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,140
companies and big companies tend to be

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,700
the most dysfunctional ones here and it

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,140
sort of horrifies me but it shouldn't

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,720
because it's that I've been watching

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,060
this for years you know I just visited a

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,730
bank a bank recently a big company

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,440
should be really good at technology it's

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,720
six to nine months when they finish an

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,840
application before they deploy it this

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,400
is like this is just

00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,110
unacceptable no wonder people hate IT

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,300
people no wonder people hate says that

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,860
means we're kind of in the way all the

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,750
time and I don't think this has to be

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:55,320
the case it's elastic you know elastic

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:57,300
gets used in lots of different if you

00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,070
don't have the as many quotas it's just

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,560
limited by your credit card in many ways

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:04,080
but that's really convenient for people

00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,180
you know circumstances change a project

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,400
that they estimated would have 100 users

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,320
suddenly has a thousand users it's

00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,330
really convenient to be able to just

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,520
create more infrastructure like this and

00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:20,910
it's transparent consumption based

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,130
pricing you know you have some idea of

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,200
going I'm going to use X it's going to

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,820
cost me this now because people are

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,640
really bad at estimating they may get

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,530
that estimation wrong but there's no

00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,090
longer these sort of hidden costs I

00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,670
think this has been one of the problems

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,830
with it2 we've sort of

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:39,080
kept that stuff to ourselves for the

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,130
rest of the company you know one of the

00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,630
things I really liked when I first

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,030
joined Google because I did actually

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,650
used to work at Google was that if you

00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,960
went internally to use they use Gennady

00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,580
for their infrastructure if you went and

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,110
requested a box there was just a little

00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,510
marker next to it the way this is how

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,500
much it's going to cost the company and

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,200
I think you should put that information

00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,490
in the hand of users I really like that

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,680
there's one things we're trying to work

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,560
on around OpenStack how do we take our

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,270
existing hardware and show users you

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,800
know what this is how much it'll cost if

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,050
you do this this is my how much it'll

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,760
cost if you do this the story I heard of

00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,730
google was before they did this everyone

00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:17,060
would go big instance eight gigs of ram

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,740
fast as disposable go and then they'd

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,900
run some crappy little node app which

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,290
might run away and eat all of that cpu

00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,340
and ram but that's sort of not the point

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,930
then they introduce this thing and they

00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,160
just went this is how much it costs and

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,220
it doesn't even matter if that money

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,680
doesn't map perfectly be giving people

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,820
some sense of that I really think if you

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,860
give people information they'll

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,450
generally do the right thing if a

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,310
developers looking at going huh I don't

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,080
need to oversize this instance it's just

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,600
some dev box it doesn't matter if it

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,620
takes 10 seconds rather than five

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,870
they'll kind of do the right thing

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:54,110
because again i don't think most people

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:56,150
the idiots so this is one of my favorite

00:16:54,110 --> 00:17:01,280
drum machines in the world this is the

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:03,890
808 and bear with moving this the 808

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,390
came out and it's a really really

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,550
amazing drum machine but it's really

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:10,160
really limited if you have a look here

00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,980
this is the step sequencer so over a bar

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,110
you only have 16 steps there's a few

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,180
things you can do you can kind of create

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,710
swing you can have do little things to

00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,570
sort of create stutter and sort of give

00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:23,000
you a beer variation but this is nothing

00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,990
compared to having a drummer if you have

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,610
someone who's a drummer there they can

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,800
sit there doing you know little triplets

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,330
all over the place little fills there's

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,310
lots of feel they can move back and

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,990
forth and that's how we'd sort of

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,660
produce music in lots and lots of ways

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,850
but what I'm arguing is I think the

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,220
constraints around this system which was

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,630
also really cheap at the time drum

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,820
machines were really really really

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,220
expensive and the other weight came out

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,520
and had all this flexibility but it also

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,680
had a crazy amount of constraints

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,350
that's not many very different places

00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,360
for a sound to happen and so I think

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,610
what happened was we started seeing

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,560
people dealing with those constraints

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:03,760
and that creates another kind of

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:06,610
innovation electronic music kind of

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,370
exploded after that if you go back and

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,080
look at this drum machine a lot of what

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:15,040
people wouldn't started doing we're just

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,110
really simple breakbeats really really

00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,690
simple sort of steps really simple

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,880
rhythms you know or even really for four

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:25,960
beats just a drum machine kicking on

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:29,050
every beat this exploded into this like

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,240
huge scene that you know still is like

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,860
one of the most you know I think

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,480
electronic music is now completely

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,770
crossed into the mainstream because

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,750
there's lots and lots of really awful

00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:41,050
stuff which is probably a sign that has

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,790
gotten really popular and if you talk to

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,190
anyone who's like an electronic music

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,570
nerd they're going to be really annoying

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,740
so you'd be like what sort of music do

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,110
you like and they're like well you know

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,030
I like micro house future jazz post

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,360
jungle and they'll come up with these

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,950
crazy crazy little micro genres because

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,410
it's how people kind of communicate but

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,570
I think the reality is you look at and

00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,010
this is just one small bit of one of the

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,340
maps out there of electronic music

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:08,680
genres all this innovation happened and

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,440
these are really really different scenes

00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,600
in many ways like the difference between

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,250
the people who you know are in London

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,840
listening to drum and drum and bass

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,570
versus the people are interested a

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,370
really happy hardcore house these are

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,540
completely different worlds and they

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,180
don't even really consider themselves

00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,400
siblings in many ways but they all came

00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,250
out of this sort of these constraints of

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,310
really simple rhythms producing

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:36,940
innovation and I think there's an

00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:40,330
analogy here with design if designs done

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,570
well if you're actually trying to design

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,800
an object or a system for user in many

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,510
ways I think the best way to think about

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,540
it is you're making decisions on their

00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:52,300
behalf you don't want to give them

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,130
infinite choice because that's sort of

00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,480
what we like dealing with we like

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,340
dealing with infinite choice we like

00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,720
having a list flexibility but for

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,090
someone who just wants to get something

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,490
done you know simpler often becomes

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,080
better you want to make it so you know

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,150
they don't have to think anywhere near

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,440
as much I think if you look at the cloud

00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,910
services they were like well you know

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,130
what do people want click a button I

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,410
want to launch an ec2 instance I went a

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,500
fork a github repository I want to just

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,760
create a new account in google apps

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,560
these things all became really really

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,110
simple compared to sort of the myriad

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,880
ways we had to do things before and I

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:29,500
think good design does this for the user

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,790
there's bad design this is a really

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,160
amazing website if you haven't seen it

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:35,230
forward dark patterns org and it's kind

00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,650
of where evil UX and user experience

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,000
people go if you've ever you know and I

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,260
get the salt on I've been I was away on

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,910
holiday for two weeks and I've been

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,710
traveling so I have a ridiculous amount

00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,810
of email backed up so I'm like

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,310
unsubscribing from random marketing

00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:51,130
emails that I never signed up to in the

00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,900
first place and I've just I spent four

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,330
hours doing it the other day which for

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,480
like a ridiculous waste of time and it

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,220
was interesting looking at how different

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,330
all of these peoples unsubscribes up

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,160
there are companies who are actually

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,960
pretty good with this the email has a

00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,570
clear link you go unsubscribe and they

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,460
go Thanks sorry if you ever want to get

00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,750
in touch with us here you go then you

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,190
get other people you click on the link

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,750
and they're like what email address did

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,890
you sign up with like you know what

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,530
email address i signed up with i'm

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,180
clicking on it from my email the only

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,670
reason you're doing that is to create

00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,200
friction you know and then they will do

00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,940
something like autocomplete we'll put a

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,410
space at the end and then they'll go

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,510
well sorry we don't expect email to

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,520
accept email addresses with spaces in

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,590
them there are ways to kind of design

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,140
and make decisions that aren't for the

00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,760
user and I think this is sometimes what

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,250
we've also been guilty of in operations

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,480
we make decisions that are for us not

00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,600
necessarily for the people who are

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,880
consuming our services so i highly

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,640
recommend this site just going through

00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,440
the sections on unsubscribe and you know

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,000
horrible things where it's really

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,070
difficult to mouse over to get to the

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,050
contact and report abuse button and

00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,470
there's ways you can really abuse this

00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,470
sort of process

00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:08,340
so if you look at the things that really

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,499
suck about the cloud I can argue that I

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,970
think these constraints are actually

00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:14,009
what sort of created a whole bunch of

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,659
innovation and we can actually implement

00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:17,879
these same constraints because there are

00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:23,519
actually good things in our own data

00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:24,629
centers it's unreliable in terms of you

00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,239
don't know when it's going to go down

00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:29,009
much more so than your own Hardware you

00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:31,019
might get a maintenance outage and AWS

00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:32,489
zone might go down and you don't

00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:35,729
actually have any even have any control

00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:37,080
over that the performance sucks as we

00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,460
kind of went through it took a long time

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,399
before we started getting really big

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,139
cloud instances with Amazon and I still

00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:44,190
think that's kind of hilarious though if

00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:46,049
you I think if you go to the highest

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,879
amazon performance tier they're

00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:49,320
essentially giving you a server like it

00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:51,179
is just a single server there's just

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,269
tooling on top of it to make it feel

00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,950
like you've got more options it's also

00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,559
isolated from your existing

00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,759
infrastructure and I think this was a

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,580
real problem for a lot of people because

00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,169
the security model of a lot of companies

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,119
and I don't quite know what the German

00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:08,220
analogy for this is but in the u.s. I'd

00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,019
call it the Krispy Kreme donut analogy

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,879
you have a thin crispy layer of security

00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:13,830
on the outside but it's just all chewy

00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:15,960
dough and the inside people go it's

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:19,049
behind the VPN it's behind the veil wall

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,609
it's totally secured and then so people

00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:21,989
started deploying stuff in the cloud and

00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:25,710
they had to start thinking about

00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:28,489
security in a different way it's

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,629
unreliable in a bunch of different ways

00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:32,549
you don't know what performance you're

00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:34,320
getting your sharing that stuff with

00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:35,429
someone else you don't quite know what

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,139
they'll what else is going on the

00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:39,330
hardware you don't know what background

00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:41,099
maintenance operations are going on if

00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,049
you've ever SAT there in benchmarked

00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:45,210
lots of infrastructure as a service

00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:47,599
instances you'll see some pretty wild

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,979
variations going on even just over time

00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:53,070
but I'm gonna argue I think this is a

00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:54,509
good thing one of the biggest

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,389
constraints i think is that the cloud

00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:59,879
just doesn't care you get an email we're

00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:03,389
going down tomorrow restart your

00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:04,799
instances there's no pushback have often

00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:06,330
when you're inside a company and someone

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,249
goes hey I need to do network

00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,749
maintenance and then the other team goes

00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:12,029
well you can't do it that day because

00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:13,139
we've got a release or you can't do it

00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:14,909
that day because we're just about to

00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:16,679
push out a change to something else and

00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:18,240
you end up with this silly back in

00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,789
where people start negotiating

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,820
maintenance windows and change becomes

00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:25,200
slow but if you're using a cloud service

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,850
you know you'll get an email from google

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,950
going you know Google compute engine

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,019
it's going to go down for 20 minutes on

00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,269
this day and you just have to deal with

00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,580
it you don't have any choice but I think

00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:37,559
this is a good thing because it means

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,970
you move quickly it means people start

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,980
absorbing different philosophies about

00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,990
how they actually do operations and

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,100
infrastructure changes because they just

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:48,059
had to deal with this sort of

00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:50,639
fundamental unreliability you don't have

00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:53,100
any control over all sorts of things you

00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:54,929
know they may be sort of slight Network

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,399
blips at the edges of the routers you

00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:58,679
may be seeing just bandwidth constraints

00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:01,019
going on you may just find that some

00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,840
zone has been over provisioned and

00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,460
everything just goes to you don't

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,350
really have any controllers you don't

00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:12,149
get to push back on what they're saying

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:13,710
and you just have to deal with it it's

00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:15,360
also there's been this perception I

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,649
think the public cloud service insecure

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,990
and I mean this in a different sense

00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:21,029
from secure from government prying and

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,730
the other things I talked about it's

00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:25,889
that it's out there on the internet it's

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,169
no longer inside the data center it's no

00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:30,929
longer behind your you know crispy shell

00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:32,429
of security it's out there and you've

00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,110
sort of got to deal with that that

00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:37,049
communication is going across the

00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:40,740
internet and I think these things caused

00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:43,470
us to really really redesign how we do

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,649
architecture of systems and I think this

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,539
has been a good thing on the right here

00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:50,129
we have like an old moral modular

00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,220
synthesizer and this is what all

00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:55,379
synthesizers were like for a long time

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,159
you had to patch everything together if

00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:57,720
you've ever seen one of these in

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,629
operation I think I've got a few shots

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,980
later there's just cables everywhere you

00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:03,690
can't remember where things are

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,940
necessarily plugged into and they were

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,309
analog underneath their pitch wobbled

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,659
all over the place and there was all

00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:11,460
sorts of crazy sounds you could produce

00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,830
with these but they were expensive and

00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,330
they were heavy if you look at the

00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:18,259
difference in the user interface of what

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:20,789
a really classic sent the yamaha dx7

00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:23,399
this may be the worst user interface

00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:25,409
known to man in some ways there's a data

00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:28,169
to split data change knob here and

00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:30,360
you've got this tiny little LCD screen

00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:32,120
do you get to essentially

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,170
through one by one to change parameters

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,480
but turned out users didn't actually

00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:39,600
want this most of the time most

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,370
musicians just wanted to make music you

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,590
couldn't store presets of this very

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,180
easily you could maybe take a photo of

00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:49,350
the whole thing and then go and redo it

00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:51,390
afterwards the dx7 came with I think 500

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,860
presets and the hilarious thing about

00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,980
this synth is because the interface is

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,740
so bad at changing anything you buy them

00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,910
second here now which is what

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,590
thirty-five years or something after

00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,200
they came out they all still have the

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,720
same presets there's no ability to reset

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,980
the damn thing to factory settings but

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,080
the thing is they're all at factory

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,240
settings all of the time because no one

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,890
could work our have change it partly

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,700
that was because it was FM synthesis and

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,980
I don't think anyone actually

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,380
understands FM synthesis really unless

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,930
you're probably a audio programming

00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,020
professional but these things were huge

00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,550
they sold by the bucketload and why

00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,380
because I think they did what people

00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,720
actually want it they rude the designers

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,800
from Yamaha went you know what we're

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,690
just going to give people a whole bunch

00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,040
of presets we're going to give them a

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,510
way to edit it but we don't really want

00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,100
them doing that but it's going to be in

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,810
tune every time they turn it on it's

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,820
light it's made out of plastic they can

00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,070
stick it in a flight case they can take

00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,170
it on the road and these things became

00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,570
way more popular than any other kind of

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:51,660
synthesizer there's still so many of

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:54,420
them around and I think that's because

00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:57,090
you've got this spectrum you can have a

00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,220
really really flexible system which lets

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:02,130
you do all sorts of things but users

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:05,570
want affordances they want ways of doing

00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,570
the thing they're actually trying to do

00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:11,760
so i think the cloud forced a whole

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:14,220
bunch of changes in operations devs

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,780
don't need your approval how many of you

00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,760
work in group organizations where

00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:22,680
there's like distinct developer and

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:27,560
operations groups how many of you work

00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:30,630
in have those teams joined together ok

00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,920
you know there's been all sorts of talk

00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,900
about this and I'm not going to go lots

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,060
into the sort of the DevOps movement but

00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:40,290
I think Deb's not needing your approval

00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:42,570
was a really big deal companies realize

00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,130
this there's a reason why a lot of the

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,900
software as a service providers

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,240
they caught their subscription costs

00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,650
below the amount and individual person's

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,720
credit card approval within a company

00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,820
off it is it's because they get to just

00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,560
go do it they don't need to ask for

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,090
permission from management necessarily

00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,860
they'll just go and develop something

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,340
it'll be useful and then the rest of the

00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,810
organization starts using those services

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,270
they have api's and tools to do what

00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,860
they do we've been really I think

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,870
as operations people at building

00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,940
infrastructure in our data center that

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,290
has an API and I think there's one of

00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,300
the most interesting things about most

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,910
of these projects we've got being demoed

00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:20,070
here in the last in the next few days is

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:23,130
that people have realized you know you

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:24,810
want programmatic API access it's not

00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,430
just about interactive command lines

00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:30,120
there's only so much you can do with an

00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:32,190
expect script interactive command line

00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,920
isn't everything it's really great when

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,810
you actually got proper api's and I

00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,910
think the cause of all the crappiness of

00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,430
the cloud in many ways we've had to

00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,800
rebuild systems that we use their to be

00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,510
resilient so they can actually cope with

00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,860
failure and this is probably something

00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:49,500
we should have started doing a lot more

00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:55,740
but it was sort of forced on us by the

00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:57,890
cloud so how many of you in a big fancy

00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,910
data center with lots of sort of awesome

00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:03,000
functionality of interconnects and

00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:04,920
telcos and ISPs coming in out and how

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,050
many are just rude yeah how many of you

00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,320
using a data connect data center with

00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:14,370
interconnects am I using the right term

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,590
okay cool I don't think you have to be

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,030
huge for it to make sense this this

00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,170
doesn't really fit this slide but I just

00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,810
really wanted to use this picture

00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:25,790
because this is what modular since

00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:28,230
people are like with their patches yeah

00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:30,840
cabling standards do not exist in the

00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,790
synthesizer world but I don't think you

00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,830
just have to be huge for data centers to

00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:36,330
make sense there's an argument I get

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,820
into regularly with a bunch of coworkers

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,500
that they're like well you know everyone

00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,630
should be using the cloud until you hit

00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,600
Facebook sighs and I think that's just

00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:47,190
kind of stupid you know you sure you've

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,690
got to put out money for operational

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,360
expenditure when you first get started

00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:53,400
but I don't think you need to be really

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,059
huge to take advantage of owning all of

00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,529
your own hardware

00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:02,070
interconnects are really cool you know

00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:04,139
where are your users a lot of the time

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,000
they're coming in from is commercial

00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:09,809
ISPs and where do they go they go often

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,389
into these same data centers so hosting

00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:13,799
your stuff inside a Colo where you can

00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:16,110
actually have an interconnect agreement

00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:18,389
with the ISPs that all your users are

00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,190
coming in on also with the cloud

00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:22,080
providers because again the cloud is

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,610
just someone else's server they're all

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,139
in data centers somewhere they're all

00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,519
creating peering arrangements and

00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:29,399
interconnects with all of the other data

00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,779
center people so hosting things they're

00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:32,820
sort of can give you the best of both

00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:35,210
worlds and I think one of the things

00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:37,590
that's really cool about this is that

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:40,200
cloud providers have started realizing

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,720
this you can run a VPC on Amazon that

00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,250
only goes through your data center you

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,990
can actually sort of maintain that point

00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,330
of control if you really really need it

00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,309
and you can keep your storage on you can

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,559
use public cloud with private storage

00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:55,559
you can mix and match these things are

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,710
really really useful we're doing this

00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:59,880
now and you know we're not that big

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,860
we're looking at because we keep a lot

00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,139
of our stuff in Salesforce as a CRM

00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,480
we're looking at creating a debt paying

00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:08,580
for dedicated bandwidth just to

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,450
Salesforce because it's really really

00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:14,760
cheap data centers do a lot more than

00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:17,070
just give you power and a raw network

00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,659
connection these days and I think it's

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,590
worth sort of investigating these things

00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:23,639
and seeing where you can go with them

00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,260
moving to where the users up this is

00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:27,450
rick wakeman who also has nothing to do

00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,220
with this slide but he always was really

00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:33,389
amazing outfits I was trying to get a

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:36,750
crowd shot in but I couldn't you users

00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:38,279
come through the data center the ISPs

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:40,110
are often there there you know the

00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,250
network traffic is you know 20 meters

00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,700
away from wherever you're hosting

00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:46,679
something take advantage of that we

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,840
finding you know as much as the

00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:52,110
monoculture of ISPs in the u.s. really

00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,990
sucks Comcast are going through those

00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:57,059
same data centers users can get a much

00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,440
better experience in many ways just

00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,760
going directly to your hardware if

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:06,480
you've got the right arrangements in

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:08,250
place and so this is another buzzword

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,600
that sort of feel a little bit allergic

00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,590
to but I think there's

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,520
something here about the

00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,520
software-defined data center

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,590
infrastructure vendors are changing and

00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,590
this is one of the cool things about

00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,559
cloud happening and you know the rise of

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,580
the DevOps movement and the sort of

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,260
operations being treated more like

00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,850
software development and treating your

00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,280
infrastructure as code all of these

00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:34,799
convergences are the big vendors now

00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,450
actually give us api's it used to be

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,950
horrific you always reverse engineering

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:41,070
something if you want to deal with the

00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:43,080
router or a switch it was always manual

00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,850
and interactive and I think we're slowly

00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,690
seeing things change and we're even

00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,789
seeing it in some of the most

00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,380
conservative vendors you know networking

00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:51,720
storage people are not the most

00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,549
forward-thinking vendors in the planet

00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,530
you know and I don't need that in a

00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:58,020
release or pejorative either way but

00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:00,120
they just haven't you had to change all

00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,460
that much but we've actually got api's

00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,530
now we can actually treat infrastructure

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,539
like code we can sit there and we can

00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:08,639
spin up a vaca vagrant instance we can

00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,560
push it out with packet we can talk to

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,690
cloud providers we can talk to our

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,119
internal stuff we actually start using

00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:17,429
UCS gear internally entirely because it

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,320
gave us a whole bunch of AP is around

00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:22,710
compute that was really really useful at

00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:26,340
a lower layer but I think it's all

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:27,960
coming down to automation the api's are

00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,000
no good if we just keep using them in an

00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,710
ad hoc manner you know it's like sending

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,210
a thousand developers off to write ass

00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,399
off for a project at all doing it

00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,590
independently we need to like build

00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,210
things as libraries we need to make them

00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,399
more reusable and to do that we've got

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,530
to have automation because I think if

00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:45,060
you look at the cost decision when it

00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,669
comes to using a public cloud versus

00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,530
using a data center it's not just about

00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,450
how much you're paying each month for

00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,510
that public cloud service it's about

00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:56,010
there's like really crappy friction of

00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,930
owning infrastructure yourself if you're

00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,240
not automating it it's about that sort

00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,920
of you know someone files a ticket they

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,210
get some compute provisioned and then

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,650
they pass the ticket on to someone else

00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,780
and they get storage provision and

00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,130
there's someone else gets network those

00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,900
are the things that really suck about

00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:13,080
owning your own infrastructure if it's

00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,210
not automated I think one of the reasons

00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,960
people adopted public cloud so quickly

00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:20,970
is because most IT projects fail most

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,369
projects fail and most projects are

00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,480
and the great thing about a public

00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:25,859
cloud service you go where you know what

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,170
that things done we turn it off and

00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:29,309
doesn't cost us any more money but we

00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,799
can kind of do that with our own

00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:33,749
infrastructure as well we should be able

00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:36,450
to repurpose stuff really really quickly

00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:38,220
as we move to you know these worlds of

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:41,670
more and more immutable infrastructure

00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,720
we still need automation you don't to

00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,309
end up in a position we've got a

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,779
thousand people running different Dhaka

00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,880
files you want to have some idea of

00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:50,099
what's inside that stuff you're going to

00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,359
need automation whatever you use and i'm

00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,279
really not pushing anything in

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,599
particular here is clearly what we do

00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:56,579
and this probably sounds an awful lot

00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:59,460
like puppet messaging but it's the true

00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:01,880
of all of our competitors as well you've

00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,049
just got to end up automating stuff

00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,390
there's so much good open source

00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:08,190
software out there for infrastructure we

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,319
it was like we didn't used to write

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,539
software for ourselves as operations

00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:13,769
people you know we would consume develop

00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:14,789
a software and then someone would tie it

00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:16,440
together with a whole bunch of bash

00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:17,999
scripts then you'd move on to another

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,410
company you'd be like ha well how did we

00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:21,720
do that thing well it turns out it was a

00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,579
bash script triggering an expect script

00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,259
poking a port in I net D which caused

00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:28,170
some other service to open it was

00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:30,150
completely unusable anywhere else but I

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,619
think this is I think why share you know

00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,880
sharing is one of the four pillars of

00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:38,579
the DevOps definition reusing this stuff

00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,680
makes us better it lets us you know keep

00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:42,210
building upon what we have anything

00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,339
operations people have traditionally

00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,019
been really bad at that sort of standing

00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:48,289
on the shoulders of giants developers

00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:50,039
learnt this lesson a long long time ago

00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:51,509
reinventing the wheel all the time

00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:53,579
really sucks and it's not that all

00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,989
developers are good at this but enough

00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:59,369
of them were that we're actually seeing

00:36:54,989 --> 00:37:01,319
more progress but it's not just about

00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:03,390
the tools and that's why I think the

00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:05,730
sort of sharing parts important it's

00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,079
about changing our processes we've got

00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,660
it there's like this really human

00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:10,980
element to it and again you know sis

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,650
admins have not always been the most

00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,839
human oriented people on the planet you

00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,549
know we joked about our users we you

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,470
know call them losers things like this

00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:21,599
this leaves that have got to stop this

00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,890
let's build infrastructure in our data

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,839
centers that we can actually program

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,609
against that we can create api's we can

00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:28,980
create libraries we can share them with

00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:31,170
other people and we're doing it for the

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,519
people who are using it otherwise we're

00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,859
just going to keep being seen as a cost

00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:36,180
center of going well every year they ask

00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:37,260
for ten percent more money and they just

00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:42,540
buy a whole bunch of hardware

00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:45,180
not really sure what they do with it we

00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,370
can call this DevOps either with an

00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,690
uppercase D or a lowercase D or an

00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:50,640
uppercase O or however you want to

00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,520
actually sort of spell it we can call it

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,600
agile or you can come back and I

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,920
actually find these people really

00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,650
annoying you go this is just how we've

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,390
done everything all the time and I just

00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,010
don't think that's true it's not true of

00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:04,230
the industry in general I think we've

00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:06,570
always had pockets of people trying to

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:09,960
sort of treat their infrastructure like

00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:14,640
something more useful for the users but

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,050
it's not true I think this is one the

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,900
big things we've got to really push for

00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:22,080
the open source projects we have around

00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,090
data center automation they're no good

00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,250
if we don't have api's from our vendors

00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:29,280
pick the vendors who actually give you

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,540
an API hassle your resellers tell them

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,550
you know I don't want to buy that switch

00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,260
until I can do something programmatic

00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,670
with it I don't want to buy that bit of

00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,680
storage until I can actually do

00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,420
something with it we've got to kind of

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,770
apply that pressure as well we don't

00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,650
have to accept it I think there's enough

00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:45,180
vendors out there now to get it that we

00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,800
should give them our business instead if

00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,680
people aren't going to give you the

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:54,900
api's to automate with don't buy their

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:58,590
stuff this is adding a common theme

00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,120
around we should build self service

00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,530
stuff but that doesn't mean we should

00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,020
abdicate our responsibility as

00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:06,810
operations people we still kind of know

00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,670
how things should work we just gotta

00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:11,790
kind of twist our mindset think about

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,500
the users instead and you know define

00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,730
best practices and work out how to give

00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,400
a people a way to control that

00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:19,230
themselves it doesn't mean we just sort

00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,870
of give up and go let's all go no ops

00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:23,040
we're just going to give people raw

00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,990
infrastructure and let everyone in the

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,360
business kind of go crazy with it it's

00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:29,010
not responsible it's not going to be a

00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,510
good way to deal with the company you're

00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,580
building you're going to waste money

00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:35,130
it's going to be inefficient and you can

00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,450
end up with unreliable stuff but just

00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,100
because we are the sort of domain

00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:40,140
experts and know how something should be

00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,370
done doesn't mean we should exert

00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,830
control all the way through that

00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:46,980
pipeline let users provision stuff on

00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:48,930
their own let's not have these sort of

00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,370
change maintenance meetings where we're

00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,130
sort of meeting once a month to decide

00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,170
whether or not some

00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,330
things going to happen let's absorb some

00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:57,520
of the constraints of the cloud and just

00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,960
sort of deal with it and let's make sure

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,590
we're delivering things people actually

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,610
want but we're designing it for them

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,080
this is one of my favorite bits of

00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,430
software this is a bit of software

00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,600
called reactor I think Native

00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:11,080
Instruments the company are actually

00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:14,020
here in Berlin and patching software

00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,940
before reactor all look like this this

00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,070
is essentially virtual modular

00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,800
synthesizer stuff you just you create

00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:23,200
signal processing things these menus go

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,970
on forever and ever and ever and you can

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,020
build these crazy nested things and

00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,460
there's a whole bunch of other software

00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,380
in this space that all used to look like

00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,420
this the thing I think is cool about

00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,960
reactor is you've got this distinction

00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:37,150
between the module underneath that

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,950
you're patching together and the

00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,630
interface you build for it so this is

00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:50,320
the same software this is just like an

00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:53,260
alternate view these things all map to

00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,640
the complexity underneath and so the

00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,380
thing I really liked about reactor is

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,630
like I was in a band we did a whole

00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,340
bunch of stuff with this most of my band

00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,080
mates didn't care at all about this

00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,820
stuff there's like why are you fiddling

00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,220
around with that but I could sort of

00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,080
package it up and give them these nice

00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,790
interfaces that they could then automate

00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,170
and I think that was other key you can

00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,510
just click on one of these knobs and go

00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,650
I want to open this up for automation

00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,330
twiddle a MIDI knobs somewhere else on a

00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,310
bit of hardware and suddenly those two

00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,660
things are mapped together I think this

00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:22,120
is a really good philosophy for us to

00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,950
think about we're going to always have

00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,110
mess and crap to deal with because i

00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:28,810
think you know infrastructure in some

00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:30,460
ways can be inherently messy but we

00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,410
should be able to package it up and give

00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,180
people the right kind of knobs the right

00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:36,820
kind of automation to do what they want

00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:42,760
with it and we shouldn't exert control

00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:44,230
over all of that stuff so what are the

00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,550
things you have to do and i think you've

00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,410
probably heard all these messages before

00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:50,110
but let's think about it when we're

00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:52,570
building our own data centers assume

00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,980
everything is going to break because i

00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,750
think if you when you assume everything

00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,060
is going to break you end up building

00:41:55,750 --> 00:42:00,070
better stuff and this is the one of the

00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,560
things the cloud has done performance is

00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:05,020
really crap you know I have to deal with

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,810
this outage and be having all these

00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:10,630
changes forced on me build it so that it

00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:13,420
copes with it I get really frustrated at

00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:15,430
people who respond to you know fragility

00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,170
in a system and go you know we need to

00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,330
do we need to restrict it so changes

00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,670
only happen on the third friday of every

00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:23,800
month and the approval process happens

00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:26,740
two weeks before that this just kind of

00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,330
sucks if we just build things assuming

00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,920
failure at all the layers of our

00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,630
infrastructure we're going to end up

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,850
things that are much more resilient we

00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,380
can create change much faster and we can

00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:39,460
put more control in the hands of end

00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:41,410
users users will break stuff they will

00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,850
abuse things they will create way too

00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:45,130
many they will consume too many

00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:47,290
resources all of these sorts of things

00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,690
but if you assume everything is going to

00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:51,490
break it'll be fine you know you just

00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:53,890
turn off their accounts you move

00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:55,210
services from one area to another we

00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,810
should be able to kind of deal with this

00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:01,200
and one of the things I really like

00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:03,970
about having a fully automated system is

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,040
you don't need the same kind of disaster

00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:08,440
recovery your disaster recovery

00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,910
processes can all but your tests can all

00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,770
be about how you actually respond to

00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:14,050
failure rather than sort of having this

00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:15,370
beer you know 6 16 months sort of

00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,840
process where you go okay we're going to

00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:18,640
do a dr exercise now we're going to

00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,160
failover you should be doing that all

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,660
the time if we've embraced failure if

00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,950
we're actually sort of assuming

00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,740
everything is going to break because

00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,940
it's crap you just sort of end up in a

00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:32,650
better place and you're building better

00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:34,210
services on top of it small components

00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,340
this is one of the revolutions I think

00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:40,900
in the last few years of synthesizers

00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:43,120
these things here are all tiny they're

00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,740
like this big i thing cuz the

00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,060
performance sucked in the cloud we built

00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,160
we started building more small

00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,930
components we stopped just going here's

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,910
a box there's a huge monolithic layer

00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,100
let's have it all communicate internally

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:56,320
it's that same security model of its

00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:59,290
crispy on the outside but it's all a

00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,360
mess on the inside being forced to move

00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,550
to small components for things means

00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,320
they're more easily replaceable they're

00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,060
more easily scalable you've got more

00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,190
formalized interfaces between them you

00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,750
can upgrade things in parts rather than

00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,760
just creating these apps that no one

00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:15,160
knows how to run this is one of the most

00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,540
terrifying things whenever I talk to you

00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,390
know particularly banks because they've

00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:20,369
got all your money but

00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,170
they have these apps that someone wrote

00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:24,240
and they keep bringing they'll bring in

00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,589
a contractor and someone will have you

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,569
know historical ancestral knowledge

00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:30,059
about how the thing actually works and

00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:31,170
everyone's afraid to really touch it and

00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:33,990
if we move to a world of small

00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:36,000
components it's easy to change things we

00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,319
can take one bit we can get rid of it we

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,510
can replace it with something else and

00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:41,730
it means we can build tools to do that

00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,650
it's really hard to build big software

00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:45,660
projects you know software is not easy

00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,000
to build but it's much easier to build

00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:51,630
small things once everything's reduced

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,970
to that sort of a component so I want to

00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:55,769
kind of say this again just because it's

00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:58,260
so cool how much stuffs out there at the

00:44:55,769 --> 00:45:01,170
moment it was so frustrating i think in

00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:04,019
the 90s being a sysadmin going wow I'm

00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,819
building it almost everything myself but

00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:08,519
we've actually got these big successful

00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:10,230
projects going on you know we're talking

00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,000
about a lot of them here you know mitch

00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:13,380
is here talking about vagrat like I

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,460
couldn't live with that vagrant anymore

00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,680
I don't know how I did puppet

00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,720
development before it just being able to

00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,700
have these fast feedback cycles we've

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,069
got lots of really really cool stuff

00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:27,380
it's kind of an exciting time to be in

00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:27,380
operations thank

00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:38,890
so if anyone had any questions or just

00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:46,240
think I thought I was wrong or anything

00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:55,030
feel free to yell at me burn promised me

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:57,930
he had a question I think your comment

00:45:55,030 --> 00:46:11,770
this morning was we invented stoic

00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:13,660
germans invented being stoic you could

00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:16,200
also tell me where's a really good place

00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:19,720
to go listen to techno this weekend if

00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:25,829
you know that works too or you can just

00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:25,829
come tell me afterwards sure

00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:49,170
yes so arms question yeah I will people

00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:52,380
how far should we go with expecting

00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:54,000
failure you know Netflix talked about

00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,500
this a lot has everyone heard of you

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,050
know the chaos monkey and the chaos

00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,700
gorilla project they made it's basically

00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:01,890
they wrote a bunch of code to just make

00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,000
stuff fail all the time and they can do

00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,800
that because they're really really huge

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,940
and they built this big resilient

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:11,190
architecture you know the more testing

00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,900
you do the better I think one of the

00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,940
coolest things I learned from being a

00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,770
Google is there dirt exercises they

00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,760
would do where you'd sort of tell

00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:20,760
everyone hey there's going to be a

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,590
disaster test in August and you wouldn't

00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,790
really have any other details then

00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,290
everyone else would sit there planning

00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:28,020
it and we'd actually push shell scripts

00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:30,630
out to all of the boxes just creating

00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:32,070
firewall rules to simulate outages and

00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:34,200
it was sort of safe words you could call

00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:35,190
up but if you ran a service you were

00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,170
told there's going to be a whole bunch

00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:39,840
of outages all of your processes have

00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,610
got to kind of deal with that if all of

00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,320
you are in it might be the one whole

00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,510
office goes away so you need to make

00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,220
sure your documentation up to date one

00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:49,920
year it was awesome because the exercise

00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:51,780
was that an earthquake caused mountain

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,220
view to fall off the side of America and

00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,770
I was in the mountain view office so we

00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,970
just SAT there and watched all of the

00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,740
other teams try to read our

00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:00,840
documentation and you could get an

00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,700
exemption for your service you could go

00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,200
look I'm really not ready for the

00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,640
disaster exercise and you'd get an

00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,680
exemption through all the fire wall

00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,730
stuff but everyone got really shitty at

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,760
you for that and it was kind of this

00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:13,710
really black mark I always thought that

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,450
was an amazing sort of exercise we did

00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:18,480
one the other day we had to upgrade a

00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,890
course which in our data center and my

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,120
network guy who's really really into

00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:23,640
this stuff was like I'm running the

00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,280
whole thing like it's a disaster and so

00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,960
he was that he was there flipped the

00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,340
core switch and basically all the remote

00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,660
people had to kind of deal with them he

00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,950
just SAT there and documented all the

00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,660
things that could go faster and faster

00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,160
and I think they did it at one in the

00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,360
morning and was services that are only

00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,100
used during the day so it didn't

00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,810
actually have any impact but you know

00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,440
those things are really really cool and

00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:44,520
really useful and there's sort of fun

00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,790
did that really did answer what you were

00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,790
getting at

00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:55,730
any further questions I'm waiting burned

00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,200
yep

00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:33,080
yes so I think as far as noisy neighbors

00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:34,970
consuming resources on the same hardware

00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,940
you're on I don't think it's as much of

00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:39,620
a problem as it used to be mainly

00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,180
because they'll charge you if you want

00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:43,550
if you want to be insulated from that

00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:45,080
you can pay more money and you might be

00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,060
and they're definitely on the really

00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,370
small instances like if you launch tiny

00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:53,780
amazon instances we see really big

00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:55,190
variations in performance there as far

00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,510
as I think adding it is really

00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,760
interesting seeing how different things

00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:01,850
are between the US and Europe as far as

00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,830
public cloud consumption goes I think

00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:05,510
that the standard sort of wisdom is that

00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:07,670
you know Europe is more compelling

00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:09,410
complicated in terms of regulation and

00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:11,000
you might have laws saying you know if

00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:13,550
I'm in Belgium my data can't actually

00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,320
leave Belgium and I know there's a few

00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,430
checkboxes depending which country

00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:19,070
you're in you're launching stuff from

00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:22,310
your AWS console but I don't think

00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:24,710
that's kind of the whole story I think

00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:26,960
and you know again I'm not a cloud hater

00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:29,210
but i think the height bubble started in

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,040
Silicon Valley and spread out and it's

00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:33,680
probably got an inverse square law or

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,940
something as geographically in terms of

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:43,490
how susceptible you are to the hype oh

00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:45,080
yeah we use I'm like and this is just

00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,820
personal anecdote not kind of I guess

00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,440
endorsement but there's this really cool

00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,360
little service called cloud ability that

00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,940
you can just wire up to that AWS billing

00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,560
API and we actually got really really

00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:56,630
sort of strict about this recently

00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,790
everyone a puppet labs has to tag

00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,280
instances in the same way and go this is

00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,690
the owner this is the project and sort

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,010
of tag it with a consistent set of

00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,510
metadata and we've just got other

00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:07,640
scripts that destroy every instance

00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:09,470
every hour that aren't tagged properly

00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,790
and because they're tagged we can

00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,860
actually sort of feed it into this thing

00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:15,020
called cloud ability and actually go huh

00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,730
you know we're doing scale testing on

00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:19,640
puppet enterprise and that cost us

00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,990
15,000 this month instead so that was

00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,750
the thing that actually gave us a lot of

00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:26,180
insight into switching a lot of that

00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:28,190
stuff onto on-premise stuff because I

00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,660
think you know the rough sort of numbers

00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,790
were that were sort of spending twenty

00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:33,200
thousand a month on stuff that we could

00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:35,120
spend eighty thousand dollars on

00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,800
hardware and get the same kind of goals

00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:39,740
and it was sort of a little different

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,520
for us because you know the sis admins

00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,900
at puppet labs know

00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,490
puppet really well and so they can kind

00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,310
of push out automation and the frictions

00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:48,260
really really low but I think those sort

00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,640
of cost equations it's not really

00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,320
interested in the interests of the cloud

00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,790
providers to make that super transparent

00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,930
but I think they're going to have to and

00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,460
if they don't we're going to keep seeing

00:51:53,930 --> 00:52:01,820
little services popping up and filling

00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:04,970
the gaps cool no more questions perhaps

00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:07,160
one question from me um how many servers

00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:11,810
do you run in cloud at puppet laughs or

00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:14,270
at abs or AWS man um just a difference

00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:16,730
so specially most of our service so i

00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:19,100
think the forge is on google computer at

00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:22,730
the moment and but we're looking at

00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:26,210
other options most of our stuff we're

00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:29,030
actually trying to move on premise we we

00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:32,300
use UCS hardware and but we we hate

00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:34,970
sands so I'm sorry anyone who works for

00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:37,490
a same vendor but debugging ice cuzzies

00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:40,730
never may do a good time so we're just

00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:43,730
running ZFS NFS for a sort of storage

00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,350
layer I think when we're doing scale

00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:47,000
testing will create thousands and

00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:48,740
thousands of instances an hour but

00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,540
they're often sort of ephemeral like

00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:53,150
will spin up an enterprise master and go

00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:57,080
hey you know does this work with 3000

00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:59,870
hosts where does it fail as far as

00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:01,850
public services go it's really just sort

00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:04,280
of things like the websites and things

00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:06,980
that we can want to hook into a CDN or

00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,390
easily I realized that was a really

00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,700
crappy answer part of the reason is I

00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:12,680
don't actually do it anymore and my sis

00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,650
admins kind of get to manage their own

00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:20,210
budget in a lot of ways except when it's

00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:24,130
lots and lots and lots of money okay

00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:24,130
