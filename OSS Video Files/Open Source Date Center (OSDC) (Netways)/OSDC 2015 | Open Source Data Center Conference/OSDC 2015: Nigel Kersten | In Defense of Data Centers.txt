Publication date: 2015-04-27
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Modern operations practices and Devops-style methodologies don’t have to require the adoption of public cloud services. For some environments, making a modern data center the core of your operations is the most flexible and appropriate choice if you ensure the implementation of some of the same constraints as the public cloud.
In this talk we’ll sketch out how automated modern operations practices can transform your operational efficiency in data centers without necessarily requiring the use of public cloud, private cloud, or even virtualization.
