Title: OSDC 2015: T. Golubenco | Application Performance Management with Packetbeat, Elasticsearch, Kibana
Publication date: 2015-04-30
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Typical Application Performance Management (APM) solutions like New Relic, AppDynamics or Compuware are closed source because they require significant up-front development efforts. Due to the recent advances in open source storage and analytics technologies, it is now feasible to create a generic APM that is more applicable, more flexible and easier to integrate than the commercial alternatives.
The talk will present the requirements for a good open source APM solution and the proposed Packetbeat architecture to meet those requirements. It will demo our automation scripts for installing the complete Packetbeat system and it will show how to use it to monitor the performance of an example Django application. It will also introduce Bonito, a new web interface for the Packetbeat data which is complementary to Kibana. Finally, the talk will explain the differences in overhead and features when compared to the commercially available tools.
