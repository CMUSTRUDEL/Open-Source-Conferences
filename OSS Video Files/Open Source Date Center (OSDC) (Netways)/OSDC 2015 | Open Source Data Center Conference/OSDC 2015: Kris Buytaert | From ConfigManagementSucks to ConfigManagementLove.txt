Publication date: 2015-04-30

Description: 
	In the beginning there was CFEngine, and the learning curve was high, then came Puppet , Chef  and the learning curve was still high.

Now we have Ansible , for everyone that wasn't smart enough to learn the original tools.  Or wasn't that the problem ?

For some people Infrastructure as Code became a goal alone, not caring about the infrastructure,  Junior people wanted to learn Puppet, but forgot about the service they were configuring.  Too Complex, Too much effort,  ..  And then containers came.
