Description: 
	OpenStack has been dominating the news on Open Source cloud computing for more than two years now - and there is no end in sight for the hype. If you have been looking into cloud computing, you will most likely have considered OpenStack as a possible solution. You will also have heard success stories of large organizations such as Rackspace or CERN. And of course people told you about all the glittering parties held during the semi-annual OpenStack summits.

What you probably haven't heard that often are stories about all the occasions where OpenStack will blow up right in your face. At SysEleven, we've been working on an OpenStack platform for more than a year now - and we would like to share our experiences with you in this presentation. We'll explain why we have decided to go with OpenStack in the first place, what problems we have ran into and how we solved them. We'll demonstrate what our platform looks like at the moment and what challenges we are currently working on. At the end, you will have a better understanding of what OpenStack means for ISPs and what kind of trouble you are signing up for when becoming an OpenStacker.
