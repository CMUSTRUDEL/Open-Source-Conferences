Title: OSDC 2015: Dr Udo Seidel | Developing Applications for the New Cloud Operating Systems
Publication date: 2015-04-30
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Along with many other things the cloud has triggered the creation of new opensource operating systems. Some of them are still a kind of a Linux. Others have broken with many traditions in order to be the best O/S for the cloud. Even the more Linux-like ones require a change of thinking regarding setup and management. This has a knock-on effect on how to develop applications which should run on these new operating systems. Using CoreOS, OSv and MirageOS this talk will describe the design and architecture of the newcomers in the cloud O/S family. This is followed by the changes needed on the application development side. The selected examples represent the broad spectrum from 'almost no code changes needed' to 'rewrite from scratch'.
