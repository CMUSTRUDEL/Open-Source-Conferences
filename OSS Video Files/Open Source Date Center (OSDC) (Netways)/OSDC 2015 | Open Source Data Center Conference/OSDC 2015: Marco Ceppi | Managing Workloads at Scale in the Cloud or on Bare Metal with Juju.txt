Title: OSDC 2015: Marco Ceppi | Managing Workloads at Scale in the Cloud or on Bare Metal with Juju
Publication date: 2015-04-30
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Whether you're deploying Hadoop and Big Data workloads, OpenStack at High Availability, or your application. Juju makes these tasks and more easy to manage, scale, and repeat - doesn't matter if you're on a public cloud, private cloud, or building your own cloud on metal.

In this talk we'll deploy OpenStack and Hortonworks Hadoop on bare metal and in a cloud, discuss what/how Juju works, and explore other possible solution/workloads which Juju can manage.

Juju is Canonical's next generation cloud orchestration tool provided as free and open source. Written in Golang, it provides fast orchestration for any workload. Juju makes use of an orchestration node in the environment which marshalls events that occur in the environment and dispatches them to the extremely lightweight agents installed on each machine.

The orchestration node also acts as the entry point for communication to the environment via a websocket API. The CLI and the GUI (both open source software) use it for communication to an environment.
