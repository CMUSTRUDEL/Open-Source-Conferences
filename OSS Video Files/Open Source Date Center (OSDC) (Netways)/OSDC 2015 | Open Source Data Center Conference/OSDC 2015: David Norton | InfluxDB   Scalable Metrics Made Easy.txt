Publication date: 2015-04-29
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	There are many applications that need an easy way to store and analyze periodic measurements, whether it's system stats from multiple data centers or a Saturday afternoon project. Learn how InfluxDB can be used to store and analyze metrics as your system scales.
This session will be an introduction to InfluxDB, an open-source, distributed, time series database. It's written in Golang and compiles to a single executable, making deployment simple. We'll see how a fresh install of a single instance can be up and running in minutes. We'll look at its SQL-like query syntax, designed to reduce the learning curve coming from other SQL databases. And, we'll see how to add nodes to create a cluster as a system grows.
