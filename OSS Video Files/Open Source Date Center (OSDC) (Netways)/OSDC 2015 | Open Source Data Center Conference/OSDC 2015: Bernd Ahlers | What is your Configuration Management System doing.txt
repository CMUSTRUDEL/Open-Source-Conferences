Title: OSDC 2015: Bernd Ahlers | What is your Configuration Management System doing
Publication date: 2015-04-30
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	If you are managing computing infrastructure these days you probably use some kind of configuration management system like Chef, Puppet, Ansible or others. But do you know what those systems do all day long? What changes are applied over the day? Did something change on a machine that caused an incident? Most configuration management systems have pluggable event reporting mechanisms. This talk will show you how to use Graylog2, Icinga2 and a custom Chef handler to collect data from Chef runs and Icinga2 monitoring events of all your machines in a central place. This allows you to see what changes are applied on your infrastructure, alert on certain changes or even correlate monitoring alerts with changes on a machine.
We will provide virtual machine images after the talk to make it easy to get started with the presented examples.
