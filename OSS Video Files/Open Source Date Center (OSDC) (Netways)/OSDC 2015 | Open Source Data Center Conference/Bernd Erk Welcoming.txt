00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:31,390
retreat nearly everything nearly so

00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:33,220
especially thanks to the speaker's

00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,690
coming over from from nearly all over

00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,340
the world especially thanks to the

00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,410
speakers which had long travel so coming

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:42,340
from the US or using the Chairman

00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,809
railway quick because it was very hard

00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,070
the last days using the Chairman railway

00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:48,129
I so enjoyed a lot of people complaining

00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,719
that it is not normally works great so

00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:51,969
on it for our expectations but for other

00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,160
expectations but yesterday didn't work

00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,899
so good so thank you I think every

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,190
speaker arrived so far we were a little

00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,839
bit nervous because a lot of speakers

00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,239
didn't know that we have out a room for

00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:03,039
them and they choose different locations

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,330
in Berlin so the rooms were empty and

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,160
the speakers were not here with a little

00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,350
bit nervous are they really coming but

00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,000
they're here so it should work thanks to

00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,530
everyone for coming over the program is

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,170
on the website so we have it printed out

00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,700
there's no change anymore we had to

00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,950
change a couple of weeks ago but

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,659
everything in the material is right so

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,869
far you can find everything here on the

00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:28,240
website we try to group the talks in

00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:29,710
specific areas but it's a little bit

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,200
makes its own at every way everything

00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,880
fits perfect into that to the message

00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,640
data center infrastructure and config

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,990
management but you will definitely find

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,189
out what the most interesting and most

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:44,079
valuable thing for you to join so i have

00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:46,590
to mention and i won't like to mention

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,869
our sponsors thanks to to thomas gran

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,329
they are in the in the coffee area so

00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:55,299
they have a couple of SSDs am to win and

00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:58,270
you can never have enough any SSDs so

00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,039
you should definitely visit them the

00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,450
linux magazine we're working with them

00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,210
together as a media partner for years

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,259
now the admin magazine which is a little

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,420
bit different because we working

00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,280
together for the admin magazine which is

00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,440
not Germany there is an admin magazine

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,110
Germany and there is an admin magazine

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,360
the rest of the world and we're working

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,400
together with them it's important so

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,440
admin magazine with an e or naughty at

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,580
the end it's a bit hard to understand

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,390
we working with the admin magazine

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,220
mainly us and the rest of the world and

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,100

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,940
company also you can visit them in the

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,380

backup so with the conference we have

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,170
Wi-Fi and if you're visiting a couple of

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,690
conferences all over the world you know

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,160
Wi-Fi is always a problem and we want to

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,390
make that you you feel comfortable as

00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:39,580
well here so it's a little bit of a

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:41,320
problem as well so it takes some time we

00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,820
have another p addresses but the band

00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,790
which is a little bit limited could be

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,980
so you have a hotel wifey and we have a

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:52,840
conference Wi-Fi as well which is OS DC

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,940
and OST see 2015 it's a password so we

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,920
have a limited bandwidth so which is

00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:02,380
really important so please don't use

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:04,959
netflix amazon prime pirate bay and no

00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,720
itunes match so please don't do it and

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,310
don't do an app store upgrade that would

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,530
be really awesome prev suite at night

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,090
when they else go to bed then you can

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,430
use the band which exclusively for you

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:19,030
so we try our best to get this thing

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,669

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:26,470
