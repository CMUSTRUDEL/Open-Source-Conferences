Title: OSDC 2015: Mitchell Hashimoto | Automating the Modern Datacenter, Development to Production
Publication date: 2015-04-29
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Physical, virtual, containers. Public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS. These are the choices that we're faced with when architecting a datacenter of today. And the choice is not one or the other; it is often a combination of many of these. How do we remain in control of our datacenters? How do we deploy and configure software, manage change across disparate systems, and enforce policy/security? How do we do this in a way that operations engineers and developers alike can rejoice in the processes and workflow?

In this talk, I will discuss the problems faced by the modern datacenter, and how a set of open source tools including Vagrant, Packer, Consul, and Terraform can be used to tame the rising complexity curve and provide solutions for these problems.
