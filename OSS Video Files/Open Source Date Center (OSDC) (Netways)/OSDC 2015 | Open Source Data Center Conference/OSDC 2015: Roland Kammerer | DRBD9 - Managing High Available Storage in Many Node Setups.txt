Title: OSDC 2015: Roland Kammerer | DRBD9 - Managing High Available Storage in Many Node Setups
Publication date: 2015-04-30
Playlist: OSDC 2015 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Recent publications show an ever increasing demand in the area of cloud computing where high-available storage is one important corner stone.
DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) is a building block for high availability clusters since years. Currently, DRBD is basically limited to two node cluster setups. In this talk we will provide an overview about recent developments in DRBD9 that allow us to make DRBD ready for upcoming challenges like many-node cluster setups and highly automated cloud deployments.
For the upcoming release we added an abstraction layer which is handled by “drbdmanage”. It is a tool that takes over management of logical volumes (LVM) and management of configuration files for DRBD. Features of drbdmanage include creating, resizing, and removing of replicated volumes. Additionally, drbdmanage handles taking snapshots and creating volumes in consistency groups. In order to support cloud deployments, a cinder (OpenStack) driver is in development.
All the mentioned components are currently under active development and this talk will provide an overview about these tools as well as about our vision for DRBD in general.

With the upcoming DRBD9 release we will be able to support a higher number of nodes (up to 30) per replication group, ease the deployment of DRBD setups with drbdmanage (up to 1000 nodes planed) and provide the foundations for cloud integration.
