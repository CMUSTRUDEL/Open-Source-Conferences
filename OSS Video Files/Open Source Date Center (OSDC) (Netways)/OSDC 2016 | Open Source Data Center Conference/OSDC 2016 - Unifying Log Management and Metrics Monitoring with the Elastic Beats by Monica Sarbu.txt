Title: OSDC 2016 - Unifying Log Management and Metrics Monitoring with the Elastic Beats by Monica Sarbu
Publication date: 2016-05-02
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	The Beats are a friendly army of lightweight agents that installed on your servers capture operational data and ship it to Elasticsearch for analysis. They are open source, written in Golang, and maintained by Elastic, the company behind Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
This talk will present the first three Beats: Topbeat for system level metrics, Filebeat for log files and Packetbeat for wire data. It will also demonstrate how to combine them with Logstash and Kibana in one advanced monitoring solution, unifying log management, metrics monitoring and system stats. Finally, you will learn how to create a new Beat from scratch using Golang and the libbeat framework to capture any type of information and ship it to Elasticsearch.
