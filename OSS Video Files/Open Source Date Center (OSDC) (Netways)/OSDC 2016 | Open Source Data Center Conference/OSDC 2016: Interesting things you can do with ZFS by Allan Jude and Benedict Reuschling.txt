Publication date: 2016-05-04
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	ZFS is the next generation filesystem originally developed at Sun Microsystems. Available under the CDDL, it uniquely combines volume manager and filesystem into a powerful storage management solution for Unix systems. Regardless of big or small storage requirements. ZFS offers features, for free, that are usually found only in costly enterprise storage solutions. This talk will introduce ZFS and give an overview of its features like snapshots and rollback, compression, deduplication as well as replication. We will demonstrate how these features can make a difference in the datacenter, giving administrators the power and flexibility to adapt to changing storage requirements.
Real world examples of ZFS being used in production for video streaming, virtualization, archival, and research are shown to illustrate the concepts. The talk is intended for people considering ZFS for their data storage needs and those who are interested in the features ZFS provides.
