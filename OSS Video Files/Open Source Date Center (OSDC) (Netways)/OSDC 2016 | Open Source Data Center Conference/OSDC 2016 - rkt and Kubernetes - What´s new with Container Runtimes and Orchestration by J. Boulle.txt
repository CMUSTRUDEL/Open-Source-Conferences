Title: OSDC 2016 - rkt and Kubernetes - WhatÂ´s new with Container Runtimes and Orchestration by J. Boulle
Publication date: 2016-05-02
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Application containers are changing some of the fundamentals of how Linux is used in the server environment. rkt is a daemon-free container runtime with a focus on security. rkt is also an implementation of the App Container (appc) runtime specification, which defines the concept of a pod: a grouping of multiple containerized applications in a single execution unit. Pods are also used as the abstraction within Kubernetes, and having rkt work natively with pods makes it uniquely suited as a Kubernetes container runtime engine. With different application container runtimes on Linux to choose from (including Docker, kurma and rkt) this session will cover the differences. It will also dive into use cases for rkt under Kubernetes
