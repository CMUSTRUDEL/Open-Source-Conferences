Title: OSDC 2016 - DNS for Developers by Jan-Piet Mens
Publication date: 2016-05-02
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	As a developer you also need DNS, maybe even more than most people, but certainly in more difficult situations. You're on a train or in a hotel room, and due to lousy WiFi or non-existant 4G coverage, you can't work on or test the app you're writing. In this talk we'll discuss how you can set up a lightweight DNS resolver on your workstation which you use in daily life and for your special situation. Rest assured, the word DNSSEC is sure to be used at least once.
