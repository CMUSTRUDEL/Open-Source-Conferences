Title: OSDC 2016: Tuning Linux for your Database by Colin Charles
Publication date: 2016-05-04
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Many operations folk know that performance varies depending on using one of the many Linux filesystems like EXT4 or XFS. They also know of the schedulers available, they see the OOM killer coming and more. However, appropriate configuration is necessary when you're running your databases at scale.
Learn best practices for Linux performance tuning for MariaDB/MySQL (where MyISAM uses the operating system cache, and InnoDB maintains its own aggressive buffer pool), as well as PostgreSQL and MongoDB (more dependent on the operating system). Topics that will be covered include: filesystems, swap and memory management, I/O scheduler settings, using and understanding the tools available (like iostat/vmstat/etc), practical kernel configuration, profiling your database, and using RAID and LVM.
There is a focus on bare metal as well as configuring your cloud instances in.
Learn from practical examples from the trenches.
