Title: OSDC 2016 - ChatOps - Collaborative Communication, or: You cannot not communicate by Martin Alfke
Publication date: 2016-05-02
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Modern IT environments require lots of communication either to other people in the same department or teams or even cross-company communication. Especially the first part where team members need information on upcoming changes, deployments done and issues fixed, we as System Administrators or Engineers, Infrastructure Engineers or DevOps team members always have to do things multiple times:
First we use a tool to identify the actual state, then we use another tool to identify and run tasks and last but least we communicate findings, results or fixes. Everything we do when using the tools is something we do alone by ourselves. Other team members might learn by shouting in the room that we work on something. Remote staff might even be unaware.
This talk will give an introduction to ChatOps - a combination of using tools and communication in parallel.
We try to find possible use cases, identify requirements for ChatOps and learn about existing solutions. The talk will finish with a ChatOps live demo using Icinga2 and Jenkins.
