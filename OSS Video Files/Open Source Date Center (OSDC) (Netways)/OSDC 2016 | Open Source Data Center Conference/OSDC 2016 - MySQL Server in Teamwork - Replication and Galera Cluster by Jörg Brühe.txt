Title: OSDC 2016 - MySQL Server in Teamwork - Replication and Galera Cluster by Jörg Brühe
Publication date: 2016-05-02
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Quite often, a single MySQL instance isn't enough, it rather should be several. The typical reasons are increased throughput, by distributing the load on more than one node, or high availability, by avoiding a single point of failure.
These goals can be achieved by setting up replication among several servers running MySQL, or by combining them to form a Galera cluster.
This talk will describe both approaches, compare them to each other, and assist with the decision which of these approaches will fit better to the user's goals and situation.
