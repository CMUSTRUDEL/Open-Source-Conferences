Publication date: 2016-05-03
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Clouds and massively scalable setups impose new requirements on datacenters; hardly anywhere does this become as obvious as in the storage and networking areas. While a number of Software Defined Storage (SDS) solutions are established by now, Software Defined Networking (SDN) is still a new topic for many administrators and IT managers. This presentation will give a basic introduction into Software Defined Networking; it will explain the basic concepts behind SDN and why it is required in modern datacenters. In addition, it will give a quick overview over the market and compare three solutions, namely Open vSwitch, Midonet by Midokura and OpenContrail by Juniper
