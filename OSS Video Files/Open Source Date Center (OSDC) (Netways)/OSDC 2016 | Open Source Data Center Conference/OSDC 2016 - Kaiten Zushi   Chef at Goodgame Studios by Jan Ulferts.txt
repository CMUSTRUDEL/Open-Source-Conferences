Description: 
	Goodgame Studios grew in the last past years to a company with about 1200 Employees. This leads to a huge amount of different kind of applications and projects.
Since the beginning of 2015 GGS also did a restructure on the whole company.  Instead of having a few huge departments with many teams Goodgame implemented a Studio structure with currently 7 studios for game development and several central departments responsible for the infrastructure (data centers, build infrastructure, software libraries, etc.).
Back in 2014 we realized that the server automation wasn't flexible enough to support the constantly growing company. So after some meetings the operations team came to the conclusion Chef might be tool to support GGS growth and change.
At the End of 2014 GGS formed a small Scrum Team („Platform Engineering“) with two engineers from each tech department - back then "Java Development", "Web Development (PHP)" and "Operations". Also the team got a PO and a scrum master. The task was simple - Get started with this shiny new automation stuff.
The engineers had just a little experience with Chef itself, but all where familiar with software development, testing and automation. So they start not only to build a configuration management but also automated the infrastructure for developing these Chef recipes.
This talk is about how we at Goodgame Studios work with Chef.  What tools we use to automate the development environment for cookbooks. How we do continuous configuration management.
And lets say how we automate the automation for testing and building the automation. Thats our Kaiten Sushi
