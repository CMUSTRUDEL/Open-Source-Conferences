Title: OSDC 2016 - Mesos and the Architecture of the New Datacenter by Jörg Schad
Publication date: 2016-05-03
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Apache Mesos has the ability to run on every private and cloud instance, anywhere. In this talk, Jörg Schad (Software Developer at Mesosphere) will explain the momentum behind the “single computer” abstraction that has put Mesos at the center of one of the most exciting architecture shifts in recent information technology history. He will explain how Mesos is enabling application developers and devops to redefine their responsibilities and shorten the amount of time it takes to write and ship production code. Jörg will outline how Mesos is empowering the new class of “datacenter developers” to program directly against datacenter resources, and draw correlations to how the Linux revolutionized the server industry.
