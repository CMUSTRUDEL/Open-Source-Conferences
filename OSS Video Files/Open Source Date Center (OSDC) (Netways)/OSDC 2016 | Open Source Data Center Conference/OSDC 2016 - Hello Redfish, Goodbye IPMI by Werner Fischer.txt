Publication date: 2016-05-02
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	It's the year 2016. The PC market keeps on shrinking. More and more people use mobile devices and store most of their data in the cloud. This is good news for server manufacturers and data center admins, as market researcher expect a growth of 3% for investments in data center systems.
To keep up with managing of all these cloud systems, IT professionals around the globe formed the devops movement and made the software part of server automation easier than ever before by using tools like Puppet, Ansible, Chef or Salt.
The software part... What about the hardware part? Hmm..., IPMI (the so-called Intelligent Platform Management Interface) has been the standard to manage systems out-of-band in the datacenter since 1998. It uses UDP port 623, has a specification document with over 600 pages, requires in-depth special knowledge and has some serious security issues.
To overcome these limitations, and to bring hardware system management to the present age, the Redfish management standard has been developed and released by the DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force).
Redfish uses a RESTful interface, is used over HTTPS, and provides all data in the JSON format using ODATA schemas. Good news for devops and automation tools :-)
In this talk, Werner outlines the goals of Redfish and shows how it works using real-world examples. Don't miss this talk and start automating your server hardware the modern way.
