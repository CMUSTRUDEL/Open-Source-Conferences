Title: OSDC 2016 - A Job and an Adventure by Dawn Foster
Publication date: 2016-05-02
Playlist: OSDC 2016 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Do you love open source and want to make enough money to pay the bills? Dawn made an accidental career out of open source over 13 years ago, and it changed her life. It has given her an opportunity to work with amazing people and travel the world while doing work that is more fun than any job should be. 

This session will start with why you might want to make a career out of open source. The bulk of it will explore the many ways to get open source to pay your bills. Even if you already have one of these jobs, this talk will provide options for additional career paths and tips for what to do improve your chances of getting that next gig and how to avoid sabotaging your career. Dawn will share her stories about how she ended up here along with some of her time management tips to avoid letting this work take over your entire life (unless you want it to)!

welcome everybody so I am I am Don

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,410
Foster I am going to talk a little bit

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,020
today about how you can turn your work

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,099
in open source into a career so that you

00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,020
can actually get paid for all of that

00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:27,730
awesome work that you do in open source

00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,070
if you already have one of those jobs

00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,480
i'll talk about some other options so

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,330
that eventually if you wanted to do

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,489
something else you could how many of you

00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,050
have a job are you right now where you

00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:42,250
primarily do work on open source

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:45,670
projects a few how many of you have had

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,690
one of those in the past how many of you

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:53,070
would like to have one of those but

00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:53,070
don't right now a couple all right cool

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,820
all right so I I actually ended up

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,710
working in open source sort of

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,390
accidentally so when I was in college I

00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,640
was at university I was getting a

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,250
computer science degree like most of us

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,820
did and one of the universities as

00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:15,250
admins was teaching a universe system

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,630
administration class it was my favorite

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,240
class I liked it way better than

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,820
programming and when I was looking for

00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,460
my first job at a university I sort of

00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,939
lucked into this junior sis admin role

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,619
at a manufacturing company now the thing

00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:32,759
with manufacturing companies is that

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:35,470
they they really don't spend money on IT

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,330
so most of the tools that I used were

00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,189
rope and sourced I used them because

00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,290
primarily because they were they were

00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:43,600
free now this was this was a long time

00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,070
ago so this was the mid-90s so it was it

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,320
was way before you went to just like a

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,900
project website or you know something

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,009
like red hat or you know apt-get with a

00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,210
package manager and so you know you

00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,909
didn't want to install some random

00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,680
random binary from some ftp server

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,479
god-knows-where so i was i was doing

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,700
things like downloading tar balls of GCC

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,070
and compiling them from source from

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,619
places like ftp servers at University of

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,910
Wisconsin and CERN so that I could you

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,519
know poke through it before installing

00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,049
it and then a few years later after I'd

00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,760
actually moved out of us ass admin role

00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:18,209
and I was doing more program management

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,540
I was I was an Intel and this was maybe

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:24,400
2000 2001 back when we were trying to

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,270
get software companies to add support

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,310
for the up come

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,280
itanium processors does anybody remember

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:34,390
those not the most successful of Intel's

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,700
ventures to say the least but I was

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,040
working on the team and our goal was to

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,360
get linux development tools open-source

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,670
development tools for software

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,100
developers get those running really well

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,780
on titanium so that's what we were doing

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,100
and they needed someone to look at the

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,480
linux developer tools and the

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,040
open-source developer tools and they

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,140
looked at me and they said well you used

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,120
to be a unix admin that's sort of close

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,560
to linux you know what open source is

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,020
which is more than a lot of the people

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:04,150
on my team so so here you go and and my

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,710
job was to to figure out which of those

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,050
open source tools were actually worth

00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,570
spending our time and money to get ready

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:14,830
for these these awesome amazing Itanium

00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:16,150
processors and you know so big part of

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,030
that was you know is there an active

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,270
community are they doing releases their

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,040
actual users for this product therefore

00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,690
this tool and I started to get more more

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,310
fascinated by how these have these

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,420
communities worked because it was it was

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,520
pretty interesting you know when I first

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,790
started using open-source back when I

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,440
was a sysadmin I really honestly had no

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,090
idea how a bunch of random people

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,709
through code together and yeah and you

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,630
ended up with something that that

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,280
actually worked and not only worked

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,410
worked really really well and then you

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,459
know once I once I started looking at it

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,200
I figured out that you know there are

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,540
there committers there maintainer is a

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,260
whole structure behind it it's just not

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,910
entirely obvious from the outside so I

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,440
started getting more and more more and

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,030
more fascinated by that and I started

00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,060
blogging about it speaking at it at

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,560
conferences which led me into my my next

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,610
open source job after Intel which I'll

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,920
talk about in a little bit no obviously

00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,620
not not everyone can be lucky enough to

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,410
accidentally end up in these awesome

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,480
open-source jobs so I'm going to talk

00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,130
about a few other options and we'll

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,290
start with why you might want to make a

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,300
career out of open source but the bulk

00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,040
of the talk will be just talking about

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,960
all of the many different ways to get

00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,980
open source to pay your bills along with

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,330
examples of of real people who have who

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,590
have used these career paths and I'm

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,660
going to I'm going to talk about and

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,240
tips for what you can do to improve your

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,740
chances of getting one of these without

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,810
sabotaging your career

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,780
and I'll also share some time management

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,300
tips so that you can hopefully not let

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:50,110
this work take over your entire life

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,940
unless you want to that's cool too so a

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,889
lot of my friends are actually people

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,349
that I've met in an open source

00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,539
communities and one of the cool things

00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:01,630
is you know especially with working in

00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:04,300
open source these friends live around

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:07,479
the world which is pretty cool I was in

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,460
I was in Prague for a Linux conference a

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,319
few years ago and so I decided I was

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,669
going to take a little vacation I hadn't

00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,259
really hadn't really done much

00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,440
vacationing in Europe at the time that

00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:18,819
was before I lived here and so I decided

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,960
I was going I was gonna go to Berlin

00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,659
that was actually my first stop after

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,780
Prague so I got here I got to Berlin and

00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:28,690
my friend claudia was hosting a some

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,520
kind of KDE meet up I don't use KDE but

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,780
I went because she was organizing it she

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,990
was a friend of mine that I'd met in

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,699
some open source stuff and you know hung

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,880
out with much kte people i'm on vacation

00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,740
in berlin like he do and then after that

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,930
actually went to amsterdam and ended up

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,830
hanging out with a bunch of post grass

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,180
people because they were having a

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,669
conference in town and a friend of mine

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,300
was there so so I ended up hanging out

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:54,669
there but that says about me this is

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,139
what I do on vacation but but it's nice

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,810
to have friends that live all over the

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,449
place and I've also been surprised at

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:05,080
how many times I run across the same

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:06,610
people in different projects a couple of

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,069
years ago when i was working at that

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,539
puppet i was contacted by someone that I

00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:13,360
had worked with back when I was working

00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:16,539
in the open fire community which was a

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,159
jabber xmpp server chat server and he

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:20,560
was using puppet at the University where

00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:22,780
he worked and he was interested in

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,210
getting a puppet camp hosted at the

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,650
University so he reached out to me and

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,229
we ended up working with him and we

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,719
ended up doing a puppet gambit is at his

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:34,469
university primarily just because he he

00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:36,819
happened to know me from my past project

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,800
the picture on the slide is actually a

00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:40,870
picture from a from a werewolf game at a

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,759
Mego conference a couple years ago and

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,069
I'm still in touch with a lot of these

00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,260
people and I found that I do tend to

00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,810
form lasting relationships like lasting

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,789
friendships with people that I spend a

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,700
lot of time with a conferences so

00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:54,260
werewolf

00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,520
liz is one way how many people play

00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:01,850
werewolf anybody okay if you I might

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,230
have cards with me just in case so

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,240
werewolf is one way but there are also

00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,380
people that I spent time with hanging

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,910
out over dinner drinking gin and tonics

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,590
you know whatever conference activities

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,150
spending time with people and I'm also

00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,030
surprised to how often my work

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,470
intersects with some of these friends

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,660
and we're often in a position to you

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,220
know help each other out some years down

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:28,040
the road and some project or activity

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:32,000
which is pretty cool this is me giving a

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:34,090
talk at a miko conference in dublin many

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,680
years ago before i lived in the UK and

00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:39,110
not everyone who works in open source

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,670
gets to travel but i think that we

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,190
actually do have a lot more

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,380
opportunities to travel then maybe some

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,080
of our peers that work on proprietary

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,210
products there's a lot of conference

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,950
travel so that's like you know like

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,230
public comp when i worked at puppet

00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,330
there's openstack summits there's you

00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,160
know gatherings for developers for just

00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,130
about every open source project you

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,870
probably participate in and and when i

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,270
was a puppet we did we did puppet

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,830
contributor summits for project

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,750
developers twice a year we did one of

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,980
them in europe around falls down and

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,580
then we did the other one in the u.s.

00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,350
around the main conference and then we

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,780
also did twenty to thirty puppet camps

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,790
around the world and these were these

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,260
are really great opportunities for for

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,000
me personally just to meet all the

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,490
people that participated in the puppet

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,200
community in real life which was pretty

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,230
cool but it also gave me an opportunity

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,900
to to travel to all kinds of places

00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,460
which was pretty amazing but part of

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,740
this is because because we are working

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,390
at open-source products our projects we

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,010
can we can talk openly about what it is

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,050
that we do we don't have to worry as

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,510
much about accidentally leaking some big

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,420
corporate secret and attending and

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,490
especially speaking at conferences is

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,930
quite often encouraged by by employers

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,910
most of the ones that I've worked for

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,860
anyways who want people to know about

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,490
the work that they're doing it also

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,990
makes it easier to to hire people and if

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,970
you work at a big company there's often

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,890
a lot of company travel so when i worked

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,900
at Intel they sent me to places like

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,090
South Korea Hong Kong Bay

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,980
to work with other companies that were

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:15,920
working on the same open source projects

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:17,450
that we were which is pretty cool I'm

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,300
not sure if Superman really counts as a

00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:23,900
future career but you know you never

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,780
know because of our work is obviously

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,580
it's an open everybody can see it we

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,470
have we have visibility that a lot of

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,390
people don't have so when someone's

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,460
interested in in hiring you they can

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,380
they can google google you and see all

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,510
of your participation in these open

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,690
source communities and being able to see

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,580
actual examples of your work is a lot

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:47,240
more useful for hiring managers than a

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:49,340
boring dull resume that everyone has and

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,780
also you know working at open source

00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,450
allows us to make connections with

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,730
people who are then hiring from the

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,290
community so I think every company that

00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,390
I've that I've worked for on the open

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,700
source space has hired people out of the

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,850
community into the company that I worked

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,040
for we did that a lot at Intel so Intel

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,320
is involved in probably more open source

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,760
projects and you can possibly imagine

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,170
but when I was there we hired a lot of

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,270
people to work on things like the Linux

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,040
kernel we had you know there are other

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,840
projects like Wayland and some graphics

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,700
projects things like that and so we

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,470
spent a lot of time hiring especially

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,020
committers and maintain errs for

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,850
projects that were interesting to us

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,070
puppet was the same way so puppet has

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,890
also hired a lot of people out of the

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,030
community and it's and it's quite nice

00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,080
you know not just from the company

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,300
perspective being able to hire people

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,980
out of the community but as a community

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,980
member you've worked with a bunch of

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,510
people who work at this company and it

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:47,300
gives you a feel for whether or not you

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:50,210
would actually want to work there so you

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,700
know I like the ideas ideals behind open

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:55,160
source software you know I can that's

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,050
freedom to use it I can look at all the

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,120
details to my heart's content I can make

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,310
changes to it I can redistribute it

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,710
without getting permission from from

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,930
anybody else which is pretty cool we

00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,570
have awesome mascots penguins are

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,190
penguins are cool and as a result I

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,140
think I think we do end up with software

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,840
that is a lot more innovative and

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,690
interesting in a lot of cases and we get

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,840
to you know work with collaboratively

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,510
with a lot of other people

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,170
and an open source projects you get to

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,210
work with all kinds of interesting

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,330
people I mean I think it's I think it's

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:31,030
pretty cool and one of the things it's

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:33,640
interesting that especially in open

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,530
source projects you're often working

00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,180
side by side if you work at a company

00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,120
you're working side-by-side with a bunch

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,640
of your competitors so I used to joke

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,070
when I was a puppet that every year

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,780
around falls down it was it was you know

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,340
me my favorite competitors a few other

00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,560
people and we all got together we

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,600
organized config management camp and we

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,780
organized the dev room at foz damn for

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,460
configuration management so you know you

00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,740
form the end I'm still friends with a

00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,770
lot of people that you know were big

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,790
competitors for the company but it's

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,900
kind of nice because you get to work

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,300
with a lot of people and even though

00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:11,320
your companies compete in a lot of ways

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,610
you you still get to work with with

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,140
people who work for those companies so

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,180
I've had you know a bit dinner with some

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,930
of those people it's a I don't know it's

00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,560
pretty cool to get to work with

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,810
competitors and have like a actual nice

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,650
relationship with them as opposed to

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:31,750
being enemies all right so now I'm going

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:33,640
to transition into the house so I think

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,590
starting a new open source project is

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,660
what a lot of people probably think of

00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,630
when they think about people who've made

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:43,360
a career out of open source but it's

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,340
also honestly probably one of the

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,650
hardest ways to make a career out of

00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,480
open source your options are basically

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,700
to find a company who's interested

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,040
enough in the technology to hire you to

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,770
work on it full time and that honestly

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,110
is the easy way in this option the hard

00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,120
way might actually probably be one of

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,490
the most rewarding ways to make a career

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,980
out of open source but it requires

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,530
building an entire company around the

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,690
technology and that could be frankly a

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,470
lot of hard work it also involves doing

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:16,740
a lot of business e things that to build

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:21,370
that company that not every developer

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:23,740
wants to do is capable of doing a couple

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,320
of examples so leanest or vaults

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,860
probably one of the most well-known

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,270
examples of this type of career but he's

00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,340
yeah he's someone who's been hired by

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,780
organisations to work on linux full-time

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,550
you know he did that when he was at

00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,400
transmeta he does that now the Linux

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:42,040
Foundation Frank Carla check here in the

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,830
middle wrote the original own cloud code

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,860
but he joined up with founders Marcus

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:50,020
Rex and holger dry off to help with the

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,110
business side of the company so he's

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,410
still as the CTO continues to do all the

00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,880
technology bits but he has people who

00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,350
help him run the business and the three

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,890
of them work together to build the

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:05,020
company uh Luke nice who's the founder

00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,630
of puppet labs he he picked the hard way

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:10,870
so he he wrote the original code and

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:13,080
then founded the company to work you

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:17,590
know to support his work on the code and

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:20,460
as a CEO of puppet of a puppet not

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,570
puppet labs he has to focus on both the

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,440
technological solutions and the business

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,930
at the same time which is incredibly

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,370
difficult luckily for me because I

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,040
worked there for a couple years he's

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,660
he's quite good in apple sides but it's

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,460
but it's a challenge it's probably one

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,960
of the harder ways to make a career out

00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:43,300
of it now participating in open source

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:46,060
projects is a much easier path than

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,670
starting a new project and this is

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,590
probably probably the most common way I

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,350
think to turn your open source work into

00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:55,210
a job and most of the companies that

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,460
I've worked for like I mentioned earlier

00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,520
have hired lots of people out of the

00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:02,380
community we did that it in to help up

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,410
the labs drive software when i worked

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:07,360
there and this is this is really one of

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,580
your best ways to get your foot in the

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,040
door with an open-source job because

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,450
your participation in the community

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,480
helps you learn skills that you'll need

00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,810
and make the right connections so that

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,040
you can land that dream job well also

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:24,580
also proving publicly that you can

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:29,050
actually do that kind of work chris in a

00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:31,540
sec was the first one here was head of

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:34,030
open source at twitter he recently

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,650
joined the linux foundation but he gets

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,900
started on open source by hacking on

00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,550
freebsd and gen 2 and started

00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,190
participating in the the gentoo

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,810
community and the the Linux skills that

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:47,200
he learned there and the connections

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,790
helped him land his first job at IBM

00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,650
selena deckle men here in the Middle's

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,970
currently at Mozilla and she's pretty

00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:55,600
well known for the work that she's done

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,430
on post grass in college some friends

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,160
taught her how to build a computer from

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,860
scratch she installed linux on it and

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,530
within a couple of months she had a job

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,340
at the law school at the University of

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:11,290
Oregon as a sysadmin and then not long

00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,180
after that her boss quit and so she was

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,530
in her second year at University and all

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,900
of a sudden she was in charge of the law

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:20,320
schools computers which I suppose is a

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,960
good way to learn quickly but her active

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,910
participation helpful participation in

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,540
other open source communities I think

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:31,480
has been one of her keys to success with

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,120
her career Dirk huggles the other one

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,820
pictured here he's currently chief linux

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,290
and open source technologist at Intel so

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,240
I worked with him for a few years but he

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,070
was he was one of the first kernel

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,170
developers back in nineteen ninety one

00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,210
for the Linux kernel and then he got

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:49,630
involved in X 486 and a few other

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:51,430
projects and in the mid-90s that work on

00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,020
linux and related technologies turned

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:59,530
into a full-time job when he got a job

00:16:53,020 --> 00:17:01,780
here adam Susa and germany now just like

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,700
companies open source projects need

00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,100
people to do all kinds of different

00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,589
things you can't really just have

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,520
developers and hope that all the other

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:13,630
stuff sort of just magically happens

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,760
someone needs to write the blog posts do

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,640
the documentation from with the project

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,160
and all those other other things that

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,990
have to happen leslie hawthorne she's

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,240
currently at Red Hat she started her

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,459
career working at Google as a staffing

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,960
coordinator and then she went on to

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:31,180
create I think the world's first

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,130
initiative to involve pre university

00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,890
students in open source software

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:39,100
development and she's been working it up

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,840
at Soros ever since Ricky Endsley spent

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,840
her early years and open source as a

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,660
managing editor for more sysadmin and

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,220
linux magazines than I can even count I

00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,150
think she actually I think she worked

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,250
for for Linux magazine there and she

00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,290
ended up gradually doing more and more

00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,840
community management as a part of her

00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:01,180
editorial jobs and then she eventually

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,070
landed her current gig which is

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:09,070
as community manager for open source

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:11,320
column at Red Hat another good way to

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,020
start your open-source careers to work

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,360
for a company that does a lot of open

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,610
source work even if you're not actually

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,230
starting in an open source job this is

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,870
kind of what Leslie who I mentioned on

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,760
the last slide you know started as a

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,350
staffing coordinator but it happens that

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,230
Google tends to do a lot of open source

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,730
stuff and she ended up in that group but

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,350
you can join one of these companies and

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,810
all kinds of different roles you know

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,780
writer marketing system administrator

00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:40,720
developer lawyer just about anything

00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,610
else and this is you know when I talked

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,200
about earlier this this is really how I

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,630
first turned open source into that

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,370
accidental full-time job you know I

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,930
happen to be in the right place at the

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,560
right time until was doing a bunch of

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,790
open-source work I had a manager who

00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,800
thought that would be a fun project for

00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:01,180
me and I've been working out up and

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:03,910
source ever since then Kim Moyer here

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,640
worked with in OT I which was acquired

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,320
by IBM and shortly after that she was

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,880
asked you know so would you like to set

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,580
up some servers for a little open source

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,190
project called Eclipse and over a dozen

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,110
years later she's still still doing open

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:20,710
source work as a release engineer at

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:23,410
Mozilla currently Carsten Wade joined VA

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,630
linux as a project writer he moved to

00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:29,230
red hat again as a project writer and

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:31,090
later moved into open source project

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,700
work contributing to open source

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:36,400
projects before it was a full-time job

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,160
and and also networking which I'll talk

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,330
about a little bit were what he says

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,830
were some of the keys to his his success

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,870
now as I mentioned earlier when I was a

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,350
sysadmin and a manufacturing company we

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,160
used a lot of open source software since

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,410
traditional manufacturing companies

00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,680
don't spend money on IT these were

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:58,090
really the only option for me so I ended

00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,610
up bringing in a lot of open source

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,110
tools into that company now I'm Eric

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,540
shema who I worked with the puppet labs

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,970
brought open source into an existing job

00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,650
to fill a need he helped a university

00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,770
move from a whole bunch of windows and

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,420
unix servers to mostly Linux and that

00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,100
was where he turned working with Linux

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,490
systems into a full-time job

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,980
was obviously before puppet jeff'll

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,960
essex is a co-founder Palomita which is

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,690
a company focused on application

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,880
security for open source software he was

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,250
working at NASA in the early 90s with a

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,130
really really tiny software budget and

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,780
he ended up using tools like like GCC

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:39,210
and others which were you know not just

00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,210
free but also incredibly powerful tools

00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:44,140
now some of my most interesting

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,360
opportunities have actually come about

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,690
as a result of my my writing and

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,880
speaking so my first full-time open

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:55,080
source community manager gig where I was

00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,059
just managing the community full-time

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,400
sort of landed in my lap when Larry

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:03,340
August n and I were both speaking at our

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,460
really small open source event and i

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,409
think it was in portland and i was

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,840
talking about open source communities

00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:12,400
and he was talking about something else

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,260
i think business of open source or

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,780
something and he was on the board of a

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:21,100
company that was having some some pretty

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:22,390
serious community crises and so he

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,409
actually recruited me into that company

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,549
to work on the community full-time so

00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:30,130
that's how i ended up with the kind of

00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:34,450
that first full-time community

00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:36,220
management gig which was interesting one

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,929
of my first speaking gigs was actually

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,169
our first big speaking gig i should say

00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:44,080
was it South by Southwest and I really I

00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:48,400
only ended up there because someone who

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,690
reads my read my blog contacted me out

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,789
of the blue and says hey you don't know

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,679
me but I'm putting together this panel

00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:55,780
of you know something to do with open

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,210
source at South by Southwest and I want

00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,909
you to be on it so I was like well you

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,909
know it's austin south by sounds cool so

00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:05,230
so i went did it and and it was it was a

00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:09,460
lot of fun you know what I bet some I

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:11,530
met some great people that way and and

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,780
when I do consulting so I'm consulting

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:17,919
now for the scale factory I consulted

00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:19,809
before I actually sometimes end up with

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,460
quite a bit of work from people who've

00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:23,350
seen me speak at conferences in the past

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,409
so when I was doing this before I

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,370
remember one example where somebody

00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:29,870
contacted me and she said hey

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,960
saw you speak at this conference like

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,850
two years ago and now I'm you know my

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,590
company needs somebody to help them with

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,410
some community stuff can you come do

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,330
some consulting for us and that was you

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:45,020
know like i said years years after i'd

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:47,720
actually given that talk Denise Denise

00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,120
Cooper someone on on this end she's

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,970
currently head of open source for paypal

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,220
and has done some really interesting

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,620
work with in open source over the years

00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,679
including creating the open source

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,570
program office at Sun and she was an

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,120
open source strategist at the bill and

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,710
melinda gates foundation of all places i

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,320
worked with her at intel where she was

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:12,200
director of something open source

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,300
related at intel but a big part of her

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,890
success has come from blogging and

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:20,210
speaking at conferences on the top of

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:23,720
weapon source stormy Peters his lemon on

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:26,179
this end she she's currently at Mozilla

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,210
and she has she has a similar story so

00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:30,980
she co-founded was later executive

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,040
director of the genome Foundation and

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:37,460
she also founded the open source program

00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,770
office at HP but a lot of her success

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,950
comes from speaking at conferences again

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:45,350
an open source ebrahim Haddad who's the

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,330
one in the middle here he is the head of

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,000
the open-source innovation group at

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:52,280
Samsung research America and he was at

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,520
University and the the professor showed

00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,950
up holding a shoebox full of Linux

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,110
floppies at the as the first homework

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,830
assignment so that was he said it was in

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:06,080
November 1994 and January of 1999 he

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,670
wrote his first linux journal article

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,470
and this is the original picture that

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,800
that went with article he refers to that

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,120
is his linux guy in a tie pic but i just

00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,780
think hilarious i'm just gonna use it

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:20,240
everywhere i can consulting this is

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,830
mostly mostly probably a job strategy

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,870
for people who are already reasonably

00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:27,440
well known for their experience working

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,760
in open source but it's a you know it

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,710
can be a great career path if you want a

00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,929
little more flexibility from freelance

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,250
consulting or if you want to build a

00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,620
consulting practice that fits your

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,270
unique skills this is also the path that

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,970
I'm currently on so you know full-time

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,810
I'm a PhD student at the University of

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,620
Greenwich

00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:47,720
the Linux kernel community of all things

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,400
but consulting allows me to quite a bit

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,210
of flexibility because I tend to work a

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,440
lot with with clients in the US and so I

00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,000
can do some of that work in the evening

00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,890
and doesn't conflict with the University

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,540
and so consulting's are pretty pretty

00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,420
nice option if you need some some

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,100
flexibility so here on the slide on on

00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,170
the end there we have a christophe

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,930
helvig and his experience with

00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,460
contributing to the Linux kernel and you

00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,920
know related technologies allows them to

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,420
do consulting for a pretty wide variety

00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:18,110
of companies while supporting his

00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:19,760
snowboarding habit in Austria Florian

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,950
Florian Haas is the other one on the

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,110
slide has years of experience in open

00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,170
sources it is an expert in high

00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:29,810
availability open source solutions which

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,840
allowed him to co-found hasst XO to

00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:37,400
focus on helping customers with open

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,740
source implementations now when I first

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:43,040
did this talk I did an incredibly

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,050
unscientific poll and asked people to

00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,460
tell me how they get started working at

00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,750
open source so I just basically ask

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,400
people on Twitter and Google+ and the

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,300
people who replied to me are a lot of

00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,880
the people who ended up in these slides

00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:58,910
but in my incredibly unscientific poll

00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,240
the most common answer was that they got

00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:04,220
started with with documentation and it

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,290
is a great way to get started in an open

00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,730
source project which you can then turn

00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,000
into a career by some of the various

00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,950
other paths that I talked about earlier

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,210
and that's typically where where I start

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,070
if there's you know an open source

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,170
project that I'm I'm getting involved in

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,820
generally the first thing that I the

00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,590
first thing that I do is fix up a little

00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,420
bit of documentation that that tripped

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,810
me up as a new user for a piece of

00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,550
software Eric Redman he's the one that

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,860
went down in the end worked at bash oh

00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:34,520
he's now at nike but he wrote

00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:36,410
documentation and plug-ins for both of

00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,600
the major open source projects he's been

00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,420
involved in and one case working his way

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,790
up to core committer and then joining a

00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,860
start-up and in the other case joining a

00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:47,570
company to work on the core product but

00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:51,080
both cases actually started with him

00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,760
writing documentation Chris over there

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,460
chief chief trolling officer at

00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,529
intimates started with documentation

00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,110
and then moved on to release management

00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:01,309
submitting patches during talks

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:04,789
organizing more conferences that I think

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:06,950
I can count jeffro is the one here in

00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:09,289
the end jeffro sir mixa he's community

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,470
manager for fergie octo also got his

00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:16,580
start in open source its documentation

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:17,720
back at Cygnus now I'm going to

00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,279
transition to some of the things that

00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,440
you can do to help improve your chances

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,110
of getting that first job an open source

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,720
or proving your chances of getting that

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:30,890
that next gig so this is this is my nice

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,630
face see how nice that is now your is no

00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,960
surprise your interactions in the

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:37,460
community live forever you never know

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,500
when that random person that you're

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,510
talking to you on IRC might have a job

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,950
for you years in the future assuming

00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:48,500
that you treat them well you also never

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:51,020
know when you apply for a job and you

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,220
send in a resume you never know when

00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,049
that person that you treated really

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,149
poorly on IRC is the person who's

00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:58,309
reviewing those resumes and you didn't

00:27:56,149 --> 00:28:00,260
even get the interview because of

00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:01,610
something that something you know some

00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,250
interaction that you had with someone in

00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,899
the past it's not always possible to be

00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,169
nice to people but we could certainly

00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:11,299
try but I do i do continue to run into

00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:14,299
the same people in different communities

00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:17,299
and you never know when you might end up

00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:18,710
you know working with or even even for

00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:21,409
the person that you're interacting with

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,789
online today I've had effect cases or

00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:24,620
people I've worked with in the past all

00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:26,779
of a sudden have been hired by the

00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,190
company to work in some you know some

00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:30,140
position than I need to interface with

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,299
you never know when that person is going

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,690
to be hired by somebody in your company

00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:38,899
and eventually become your manager so be

00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:43,970
nice for those negative interactions

00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:46,070
with people now networking is also one

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:49,130
of the one of the key ways of increasing

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,179
your chances of being successful this is

00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,029
too if you're looking for a new job and

00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:54,950
open source or any kind of new job or

00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:57,830
just making the best of the job that you

00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,240
have right now when you're looking for a

00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,340
job is not the time to start networking

00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,590
this needs to be long-term and something

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,889
you should be doing all the time it's

00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:08,389
also not repeat not about being weird

00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:09,170
and sleazy and exchanging the most

00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:13,430
business cards

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:14,480
because that's that's just yucky and and

00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,650
when I think of these activities

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,970
honestly when I think of these

00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,530
activities is networking actually hate

00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,570
the word networking when I think of it

00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:23,090
as networking it gets it gets weird and

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,410
I don't like it I feel slimy so I like

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,570
to think about it is having interesting

00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,690
conversations with with people who do

00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,920
things similar to what i do and i

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,270
recommend approaching it is that you

00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,590
know don't approach is networking just

00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,020
approaches having interesting

00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,490
conversations with ya with people that

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,340
you work with in your in your industry

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,360
or people who work on similar projects

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:44,030
people that you find interesting of

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,970
someone's boring you to death you can

00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,320
make a nice graceful exit and go talk to

00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:51,950
someone else whose work is maybe more

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,270
interesting to you and personally you

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,830
know personally I just I just love

00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,360
hearing stories about what people are

00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:59,270
working on how they ended up in open

00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,320
sores and so i don't know i think it's i

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:04,180
think it's just kind of fun to talk to

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,180
people see what people are working on

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:11,570
now once you get that open source gig

00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:15,200
that awesome job one of the tricky

00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:17,470
things can be these projects are there

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,450
are 24 hours a day seven days a week and

00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:23,180
something is always going on and they

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:25,130
can suck up as much time as you possibly

00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,780
allow them and finding the right balance

00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,420
between doing as much as you possibly

00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:31,130
can while not pushing yourself past your

00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,860
limits and getting incredibly burned out

00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:36,170
is something I struggle with frankly I

00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,730
always have I always want to help out I

00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,080
want to do everything I want to make the

00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,030
project successful but there's only

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,360
there's only so much I can do before I

00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:46,430
make myself crazy so I do try really

00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,530
hard to prioritize my activities

00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,990
especially when I already feel like I'm

00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:53,270
starting to get burned out and I try to

00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,370
be brutal about which tasks I actually

00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:58,070
need to focus on because they are the

00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:00,290
most important but they're not

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:02,900
necessarily the ones that someone else

00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:06,410
thanks for the most urgent and so that's

00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:09,070
a hard balance I also i also try to

00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:11,510
delegate a lot sometimes this is

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:14,480
explicit like actually just asking

00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:18,410
someone asking them to take out take

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,620
over a task but a lot of times it's it's

00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:23,000
actually more subtle than that so and

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,210
especially as a community manager

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,520
I often wait to respond to requests and

00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,790
questions in hopes that someone else

00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,830
will respond this is actually this is

00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:37,340
not just me being lazy okay maybe a

00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:40,160
little bit but it actually it has an

00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:42,110
interesting side effect because if you

00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,610
are in a community especially if you're

00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,460
in some kind of a leadership role

00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:48,410
project lead community lead something

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,690
like that and you're jumping in and

00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,430
you're answering all of the questions

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,680
then the expectation in the community is

00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:56,480
that oh you know Don answers the

00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,210
questions I I can't answer a question

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,400
and you acted what that actually does is

00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:07,250
it ends up discouraging other people

00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:10,340
from asking questions so so you know

00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:14,210
waiting gives gives people kind of the

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:15,770
space to to respond and it helps you

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,210
clear off some of the stuff off of your

00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,070
plate because other people will answer

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,930
the questions let's not say you can't

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,490
you know you should jump in and answer

00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:27,260
some questions especially the ones that

00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:29,240
aren't getting answered but now most of

00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:33,320
us fail at documentation at some point

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:36,050
or another I know no one wants to write

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,960
documentation it takes all kinds of

00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:41,080
precious time but it can actually save

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,430
you a ton of time in the long run and

00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,060
documenting those processes and

00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:48,410
procedures for the project is actually

00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,630
one of the things that makes it way

00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,630
easier to delegate a task to someone

00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:55,550
else later because if you can point them

00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,230
to a document describing exactly what

00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:01,550
they need to do someone is a lot more

00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:03,050
likely to help you with a task also if

00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,370
I've answered the same question or

00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,190
written similar content a couple of

00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,020
times I always try to make sure that I

00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,880
documented somewhere and I I've actually

00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,250
over the years I've had just tons and

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,080
tons of email templates and and canned

00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:21,080
responses floating around for things

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:23,420
like common questions or accepting or

00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,300
rejecting speakers things like that

00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:32,060
asking people to do common tasks I try

00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:35,630
to document all of that now I actually

00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,750
take my vacations very seriously for

00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,780
someone who works as much as

00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:42,630
do I I do need some serious downtime so

00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:46,080
I try to take one real vacation a year

00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:49,260
which usually involves a beach fruity

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,570
drinks with lots of alcohol in them a

00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,460
kindle full of science fiction books and

00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,690
and really not much else i actually just

00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,540
did one of these that's why I look so

00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:59,730
relaxed I just just did one of these in

00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:02,070
the Dominican Republic with my mom and

00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,510
we spent eight or nine days just hanging

00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:07,650
out on a beach in the Dominican Republic

00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:10,770
with fruity rum drinks and my Kindle I

00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:14,940
was awesome for these vacations I do i

00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:17,429
do ignore everything so my work email

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,110
remains unopened I try not to think

00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:22,250
about work I try not to think about the

00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:24,480
open source projects I'm involved in

00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:27,330
when i was when i was first a puppet

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,770
labs i was lucky because I first at

00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,330
puppet I'm gonna take a long time to

00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,830
break that habit how many no puppet

00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:35,129
changed their name it's no longer puppet

00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:38,419
labs and now let's just puppet okay but

00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:38,419
you guys did your puppet stuff back here

00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:42,510
it's hard habit to break but when i

00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:45,540
worked there i was i was lucky because

00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:48,690
it was really a community full of

00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,740
amazing people which makes ignoring it

00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,110
for a week or two and going on vacation

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:55,800
a whole lot easier i was i was on a

00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:59,910
vacation in Hawaii over the u.s.

00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,140
thanksgiving break and you know one of

00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,090
the first things I do when I get back is

00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,310
I look at all the mailing list posts and

00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:07,260
I look to see which one's had a bunch of

00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,760
replies because that's you know

00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,800
something happened there I should go

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,540
look at it so I was looking down through

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,030
on this one thread had a ton replies I

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,800
was like oh god what happened here and

00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:19,190
so so I started looking at it and it

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,160
starts with starts with someone asking

00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:26,010
admittedly kind of a stupid question the

00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,300
next person posted a reply which was one

00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:30,540
of those let me google that for you

00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:33,660
links and another another person said

00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,800
wow you know posting that you know let

00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,970
me google that for you link is a real

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,200
quote dick move and then yeah so this in

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,760
some communities this would have

00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,990
spiraled out of control and somebody

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,780
would have called myself on a vacation

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,730
and i would spend most unhappy but in

00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,890
this case other people in the community

00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,760
stepped up and said hey you know it's a

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,140
sudden I

00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,450
but you shouldn't shouldn't call it a

00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,030
dick move you shouldn't you know and it

00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,590
all ended up with everybody apologizing

00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,720
to each other and then this guy actually

00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,730
getting some useful answers to his

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,710
question which was really a pointer to

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,410
some of the clearly documented things

00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:09,980
that he was asking about but it's kind

00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:12,120
of nice to work in communities like that

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,890
now I'm a lot more flexible on my other

00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:17,640
vacations so the beach vacations I take

00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:20,360
very seriously but my other vacations I

00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,730
try to disengage from from things that

00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,770
to me feel like work and only do things

00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,030
that seem like fun so i might play with

00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,680
some new technology I've been meaning to

00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:31,590
try make some contributions to an open

00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,970
source project write some blog posts go

00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,220
to a few meetups especially if I'm in

00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:37,850
another city and then I try to make sure

00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:41,340
that I also take some time every day for

00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:43,710
four fun things that I enjoy doing just

00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,200
to kind of disengage from work and my

00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:49,080
other projects so right now it's mostly

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,820
reading science fiction running playing

00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,320
a few games of hearthstone we have a

00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,500
werewolf group in London that meets once

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,910
them once a week just pretty cool so the

00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,780
downtime the downtown is important i

00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:02,490
can't emphasize that enough now as a

00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,770
community manager working in open source

00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:07,350
communities i've had honestly just a

00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,420
pretty fantastic opportunity to explore

00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:12,120
strange new worlds seek out new life new

00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:16,050
civilizations boldly go where you know

00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:18,170
only some people have gone before thank

00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,170
you

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:34,569
we're also hiring any any questions all

00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:36,040
right i know somebody has a question i'm

00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:41,589
just gonna stare awkwardly until

00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:52,990
somebody asks it it only gets more

00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:54,339
awkward from here okay yeah go ahead you

00:37:52,990 --> 00:38:06,970
can start and then you can repeat the

00:37:54,339 --> 00:38:09,400
question please yeah so what do I see is

00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:10,780
the primary differences between things

00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,980
you do for an open source career and

00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:19,450
things you do for any other proprietary

00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:21,160
software gig you know honestly a lot a

00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:25,390
lot of these suggestions also work for

00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:29,859
for some of the proprietary gigs I would

00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:31,780
say the main the main difference is it's

00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:33,339
really just the the visibility that you

00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:37,980
get in an open source open source

00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:37,980
project from a from a career standpoint

00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:42,430
for a lot of people for people who

00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,869
didn't for people who haven't

00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,730
contributed a lot to open source

00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:47,380
projects before before starting an open

00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,089
source career people who've worked

00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,740
mostly in proprietary projects who are

00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:53,890
then kind of thrown into an open source

00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,599
career tend to and I struggled with this

00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:59,500
too when I when I first started doing it

00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:02,559
it's it's incredibly it's incredibly

00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:05,109
challenging to get used to participating

00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,819
in the open and doing everything

00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,290
everything in the open because it's

00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:09,609
different when you're in a when you're

00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,839
in a company because you you know you

00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:12,430
submit your code into the local

00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:14,200
repository and only a couple of people

00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,880
see it and if you do something really

00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,540
stupid only a couple of people notice

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,559
which is different in in the in the open

00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,839
source careers I would say that's

00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:25,660
probably probably the biggest the

00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:28,839
biggest difference I would say from a

00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:31,270
like a from a career perspective as far

00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:32,920
as you know getting a job I think there

00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:35,470
are actually a lot of a lot of

00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,760
similarities I think the mechanisms are

00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,920
maybe a little bit different because

00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,930
you know networking and talking to

00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,990
people and meeting people honestly all

00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:46,140
of my all my good jobs have come from

00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:49,030
connections I've had with other people

00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:52,740
and that's you know that would be true

00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,740
whether it was an open source job or not

00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:58,960
but but I think with with open source

00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,310
jobs I think that that actual

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,500
participation that you're doing in the

00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,700
community I think makes a makes a pretty

00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,650
big difference when you're getting that

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,180
job so I think you end up probably

00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,310
knowing the people that you're working

00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,460
with or going to be working with a lot

00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:14,640
better which i think is kind of a big

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:20,320
advantage did that answer your question

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:22,240
okay any other questions people just

00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,750
really want coffee you really want that

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,750
