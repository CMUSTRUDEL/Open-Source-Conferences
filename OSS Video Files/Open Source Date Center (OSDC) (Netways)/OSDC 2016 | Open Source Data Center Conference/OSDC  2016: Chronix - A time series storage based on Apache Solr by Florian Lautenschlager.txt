Description: 
	How to store billions of time series points and access them within a few milliseconds? Chronix!
Chronix is a young but mature open source project that allows one for example to store about 15 GB (csv) of time series in 238 MB with average query times of 21 ms. Chronix is built on top of Apache Solr a bulletproof distributed NoSQL database with impressive search capabilities. In this code-intense session we show how Chronix achieves its efficiency in both respects by means of an ideal chunking, by selecting the best compression technique, by enhancing the stored data with (pre-computed) attributes, and by specialized query functions.
