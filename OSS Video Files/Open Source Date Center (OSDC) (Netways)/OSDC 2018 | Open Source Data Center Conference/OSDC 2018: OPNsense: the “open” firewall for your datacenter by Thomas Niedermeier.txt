Title: OSDC 2018: OPNsense: the “open” firewall for your datacenter by Thomas Niedermeier
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: OSDC 2018 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	OPNsense is an open source and easy-to-use FreeBSD based firewall and routing platform. 2018 – three years after OPNsense started as a fork of pfSense® and m0n0wall – OPNsense brings the rich feature set of commercial offerings with the benefits of open and verifiable sources. A strong focus on security and code quality drives the development of the project. The modern and intuitive web interface makes configuring firewall rules funny 🙂
In this talk, Thomas will outline OPNsense’s FreeBSD-based architecture and how you can take advantage of additional features using OPNsense plugins. He will also show how to initially setup an OPNsense firewall, and how you use datacenter-features like High Availability & Hardware Failover or Dual Uplinks.
Open (source) makes sense – also for your firewall 🙂
