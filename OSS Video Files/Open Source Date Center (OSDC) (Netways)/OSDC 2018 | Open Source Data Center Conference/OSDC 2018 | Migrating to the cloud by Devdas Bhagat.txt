Title: OSDC 2018 | Migrating to the cloud by Devdas Bhagat
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: OSDC 2018 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	This is an experience report of a migration from self-hosted services to running in the cloud. While there have been plenty of business case studies showing the benefits of a cloud migration, there are very few reports on the IT side of the migration. This talk covers the migration of Spilgames (a small Dutch games publisher) from a self-hosted Openstack and hardware based infrastructure to Google cloud, challenges, tooling (and lack thereof). This migration is still work in progress, and the talk will cover as much detail as possible.
