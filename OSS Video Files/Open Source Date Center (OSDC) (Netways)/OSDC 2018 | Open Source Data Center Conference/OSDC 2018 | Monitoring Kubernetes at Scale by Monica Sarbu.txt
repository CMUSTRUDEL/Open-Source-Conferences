Title: OSDC 2018 | Monitoring Kubernetes at Scale by Monica Sarbu
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: OSDC 2018 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Kubernetes is changing the game in the data centre, but also in the monitoring and troubleshooting landscape. Static tools and vertically scalable TSDBs are no longer fit for the job. Large-scale dynamic infrastructures require scalable dynamic monitoring.
This talk presents how the Elastic Stack collects logs, metrics, and APM traces from the applications running in Kubernetes:
   – Collect application logs, metrics and enhance them with Kubernetes metadata
   – Collect application metrics from Prometheus endpoints
   – Collect Kubernetes metrics
   – Collect application performance traces (APM)
   – Autodiscover new pods and monitor them based on their type
   – Control the monitoring via Kubernetes annotations
   – Use Kibana as a single looking glass to visualize the collected data
