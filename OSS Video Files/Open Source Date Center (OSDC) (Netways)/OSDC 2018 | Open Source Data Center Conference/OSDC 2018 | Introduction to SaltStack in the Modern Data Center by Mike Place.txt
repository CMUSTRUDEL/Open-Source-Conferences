Description: 
	Modern-day data centers face an enormous amount of complexity, from managing and deploying distributed applications to monitoring and controlling changes in networking hardware, engineers face an unprecedented set of challenges in trying to tame the chaos.

In this talk, Mike Place from SaltStack will cover how to use Salt to automate and control all the elements of a modern data center, from the physical hardware to the application packaging and deployment. Heâ€™ll also show how automation frameworks can merge with monitoring systems to create event-driven infrastructure patterns that can achieve maximum observability and quick remediation to every type of deployment.
