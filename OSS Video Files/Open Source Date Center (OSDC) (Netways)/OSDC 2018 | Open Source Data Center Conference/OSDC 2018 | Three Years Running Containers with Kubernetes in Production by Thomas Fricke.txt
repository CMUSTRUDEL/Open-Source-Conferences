Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: OSDC 2018 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	The talk gives a state of the art update of experiences with deploying applications in Kubernetes on scale. If in clouds or on premises, Kubernetes took over the leading role as a container operating system. The central paradigm of stateless containers connected to storage and services is the core of Kubernetes. However, it can be extended to distributed databases, Machine Learning, Windows VMs in Kubernetes. All these applications have been considered as edge cases a few years ago, however, are going more and more mainstream today.
