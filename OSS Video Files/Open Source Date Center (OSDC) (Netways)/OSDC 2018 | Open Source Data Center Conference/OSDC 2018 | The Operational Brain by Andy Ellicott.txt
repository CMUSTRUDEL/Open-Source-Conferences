Description: 
	How New Paradigms like Machine Learning are Transforming Data Management Systems

With the advent of IoT, companies have the opportunity to put larger and larger volumes of machine data to work to optimize operations like manufacturing production, safety, security, user experience. Yet, they are finding that the old paradigms of processing this data do not help mainstream developers keep pace with the velocity of data, new analytic algorithms, and the need for real-time insight. Jodok Batlogg, founder and CTO of Crate.io, believes that the solution to this problem lies at the nexus of modern open source distributed database architectures, machine learning/AI, and IoT networking. These technologies will combine to create a new data management paradigm that moves beyond traditional conceptions of databases. He believes the future lies in a central nervous system, an “operational brain” that connects directly to sensory inputs and applies artificial intelligence to control, predict, and monitor systems and things in real time. In this session, Jodok will use-real world, in-production manufacturing and cybersecurity examples of “operational brains” at work to explain the new paradigm, and discuss the concrete steps organizations can take to implement them.
