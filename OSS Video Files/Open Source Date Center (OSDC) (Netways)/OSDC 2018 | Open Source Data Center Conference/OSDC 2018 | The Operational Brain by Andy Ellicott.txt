Description: 
	How New Paradigms like Machine Learning are Transforming Data Management Systems

With the advent of IoT, companies have the opportunity to put larger and larger volumes of machine data to work to optimize operations like manufacturing production, safety, security, user experience. Yet, they are finding that the old paradigms of processing this data do not help mainstream developers keep pace with the velocity of data, new analytic algorithms, and the need for real-time insight. Jodok Batlogg, founder and CTO of Crate.io, believes that the solution to this problem lies at the nexus of modern open source distributed database architectures, machine learning/AI, and IoT networking. These technologies will combine to create a new data management paradigm that moves beyond traditional conceptions of databases. He believes the future lies in a central nervous system, an “operational brain” that connects directly to sensory inputs and applies artificial intelligence to control, predict, and monitor systems and things in real time. In this session, Jodok will use-real world, in-production manufacturing and cybersecurity examples of “operational brains” at work to explain the new paradigm, and discuss the concrete steps organizations can take to implement them.

[Music]

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:23,439
guten tag that ends my German so for the

00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:28,180
next 45 minutes maybe a little less I'm

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,670
going to talk about just the what's

00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,570
going on in database management and

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,040
what's going on in application

00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:37,300
development and how that may affect what

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,920
database management technologies and

00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,260
practices get implemented in your data

00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,090
centers over the next few years what

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,760
technologies you may or may not be using

00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:49,469
to do that so I'll talk a little bit

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,469
about you know where we are today

00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:06,640
good thank you

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,229
so the I'll talk a little bit about you

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,009
know kind of the database state of

00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:15,100
database technology today how we got

00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:17,560
here how it's changing and a few

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,240
predictions and really about the

00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,150
connection between what we call the

00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,799
operational brain and and what's going

00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,060
on in data centers has that's actually

00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,549
what you're doing and what you've

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,630
pioneered is kind of moving out into the

00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:34,420
business and the world of things so I'm

00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,700
from the Northeast United States near

00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,280
Boston I've been in the database

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,079
management software business like

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,680
forever I love databases I don't know

00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:47,259
why especially new ones and I think just

00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,729
you know being on the forefront of you

00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,259
know database management technology

00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,600
you're usually in the forefront of

00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:54,909
software application development and

00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,290
therefore on the front of how you know

00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:58,090
software is changing the way we live and

00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,350
do business and learn and connect with

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,390
each other and stuff so it's a lot of

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,979
fun working with the customers I've met

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,799
every through each one of these

00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:08,259
databases I've worked with I'm currently

00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:12,040
at Cray do developers of crate DB

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:13,660
anybody here hurt here that or handful

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,260
of you it was founded actually in

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:21,790
western Austria also a big development

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,050
office here in Berlin and and a bunch of

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,700
us in New York City and

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:31,120
San Francisco so let's start with the

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:34,630
know SQL era right so you know kind of

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,580
brief history of databases and kind of

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,270
bring us up to where we are today you

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,160
know prior to 2005 we're really in what

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,380
Mike Stonebreaker inventor of ingress

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,120
and subsequently Postgres and a bunch of

00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,250
other databases called the

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,800
one-size-fits-all era that's where we

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,190
had a handful of databases most of which

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,130
are still widely used today the widest

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,410
most widely used today that kind of did

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:04,180
everything from data warehousing to

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:07,060
transaction processing to time series

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,010
geospatial you name it but really at the

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,930
beginning of the 2000s there were some

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,890
companies one of which was founded by

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,230
Mike Stonebraker

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,860
or a few of them actually like Vertica

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:22,120
where I worked that started to invent

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,380
specialized databases for unique use

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,550
cases like data warehousing and

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,350
analytics transaction processing you

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,430
know text search and things like that

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:35,110
and that really led to this explosion of

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,470
specialized databases and you know we

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:42,670
went from you know five to ten databases

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:47,620
to 10 to 22 now probably easily over a

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,420
hundred right the many of the no SQL

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,030
databases especially the popular ones

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,910
really were born out of necessity giant

00:03:52,030 --> 00:04:00,370
internet companies like Amazon Facebook

00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:02,560
Google LinkedIn you know had to invent

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,600
databases that were economical to run

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,380
that the scale at which they did

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,970
business right using Oracle to power

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,490
you know Amazon's e-commerce would have

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,820
cost a bajillion dollars so they spent

00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:17,169
less than a bajillion dollars inventing

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:21,280
dynamodb for example in some other

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:22,780
databases and then you know they they

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,570
gave back to the technical community by

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,460
publishing you know white papers or open

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,960
sourcing or code Facebook with presto

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:34,840
Google with you know spanner and so on

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,729
and from there really kind of set a

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,939
bunch of development communities off

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:42,449
building derivative works and forks that

00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:46,839
that have become really the the no SQL

00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:48,189
ecosystem that we know today so let's

00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:54,370
start with a kind of good bad and ugly

00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:57,219
of no SQL okay the good is that you know

00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:00,580
really allowed us to more easily process

00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:05,139
data that didn't fit in rows and columns

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:08,759
very nicely JSON of course key value

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:11,860
stores allowed us to do you know process

00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,129
richer information and in new ways you

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,300
know tech search being an obvious one

00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,819
but by and large they're you know

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,129
they're known for the ease with which

00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,889
they can scale out to handle more users

00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:26,889
more data the ease with which they can

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,149
handle new development requirements okay

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,999
just throw a bunch of new data

00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:34,199
structures in the in your your data

00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:38,309
store and write MapReduce or whatever

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:41,949
access sort of language they support to

00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:43,719
you know to get data in and out so very

00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:46,389
easy for mode to use from a developer

00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:48,189
standpoint also open source so you know

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:51,129
unlike the era before it you know was

00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:54,849
really inexpensive to create and deploy

00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:57,189
very powerful data management data based

00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:58,930
applications okay of course all the

00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:04,629
communities that arose from these

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:06,249
connect us today it also helped a lot of

00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,580
us learn what the cap theorem is what

00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:11,800
acid are I'm not going to go into detail

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,949
on this but what it also helped us learn

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,409
was what the world would tolerate you

00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,809
know if you went back to 1999 and said

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,999
I'm gonna create a database that may or

00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:24,009
may not be sure if your your transaction

00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:26,499
was committed right where you may or may

00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,759
not be reading the latest you know

00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:32,289
version of a record you know it would be

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,129
sacrilegious right

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:37,360
today of course eventual consistency you

00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,649
know we've we've learned to live with it

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,059
we've learned that that's kind of been

00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,729
the business model of things like

00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:44,439
banking and airline seat reservations

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:45,909
you know when we show up to take a

00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,209
flight we find out the planes been

00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:50,169
oversold right so we kind of learned

00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,120
what

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:54,719
you know see we were able to tolerate

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:59,439
and what kind of myths existed around

00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:02,590
the way a database had to work so under

00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:06,060
the bad okay so these would be things

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:08,770
like really no standards arose around

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,169
still really have not arisen around no

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,860
SQL it's really just a you know kind of

00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:17,259
a venture capital and startup race - you

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,460
know gather market adoption and MongoDB

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:24,639
kind of won that but it really made this

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:28,150
this lack of sequel literally meant that

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,039
you know any developer moving on to a no

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,159
SQL database project had to learn a new

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,699
way to access the database so there was

00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,129
a learning curve

00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,110
you know database administrators had to

00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:40,569
learn new ways to tune and implement

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,419
deploy secure these databases to help

00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:45,219
them grow a lot of these databases while

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:49,029
they promised you know simple

00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:51,969
scalability you know great DB being one

00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:53,669
of those they're not always that simple

00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:57,879
you really add to this in some cases

00:07:53,669 --> 00:08:00,849
master you know nuances you know in the

00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,620
databases or slight differences and also

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,259
a lot of the technology that was used to

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,240
scale those load balancers the you know

00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:13,330
today the container environments and so

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:15,849
on and I think what really limited the

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,250
growth and adoption of new SQL databases

00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:19,419
most was the fact that there were so

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,639
many of them and it was really hard to

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,439
tell the difference between between them

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,419
right they were all very specialized and

00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,149
you know to somebody kind of stepping

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:29,710
out of sequel server world and into no

00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:31,749
SQL it's like I'm gonna use MongoDB

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,599
because I've heard you know ever it's

00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:38,529
what everybody uses but that may or may

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,349
not be a great choice okay

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:42,789
so you know people were hard-pressed to

00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:44,589
tell the difference between a rethink

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,300
and a MongoDB or a couch and a couch

00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:49,060
base couch TV in a couch base or even

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,680
couch base and MongoDB so you know it's

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,720
a lot of learning just to figure out

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,730
which those databases is going to fit

00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,160
your need okay and you know in some

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,259
cases people would deploy multiple types

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,149
of databases very

00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:07,509
a lot of you have seen applications that

00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:10,269
use MySQL or PostgreSQL I'm sorry

00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:11,619
tabular data interpolation Allah but

00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,999
also that same application will use

00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:18,459
something like elasticsearch to store

00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:21,720
unstructured or full-text data that's

00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:25,029
actually how crate DB was born a CTO of

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,979
studi they said right the biggest social

00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:30,729
network before Facebook came to Germany

00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:32,529
or Europe just got kind of tired of

00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:33,850
having to support both of those and said

00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:37,839
why don't I invent a database that's

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,829
kind of a the offspring or the child of

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,539
those two things so that's what crate is

00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:45,489
and then the ugly and this is what we

00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:47,979
use the word consolidation it's an

00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:49,389
industry term for when companies go out

00:09:47,979 --> 00:09:52,689
of business and you go from having lots

00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:55,089
of competitors in a business to fewer or

00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:56,829
they get acquired but we lost a couple

00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:59,379
of good friends you know rethink DB I

00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,759
lost I mean that the companies the

00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,859
commercial companies behind them went

00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:08,069
out of business

00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:10,689
rethink DB react both kind of last year

00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:11,679
foundation DB up its little Dracula leg

00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:13,179
of their because they they went away

00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,649
when Apple acquired them but they were

00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,809
relaunched this year as an open source

00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:20,109
project by apples they've come back to

00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:21,910
life but you know one of the predictions

00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:27,189
I'll have no surprise is that this list

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:29,859
is going to keep growing okay so one

00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:31,629
other kind of observation or remembrance

00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:34,269
I have I'm kind of like a historian

00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:35,769
right database anthropologist I'm so old

00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,449
I've seen all these databases come and

00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,699
go kind of have a good feeling for

00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:42,730
what's you know what's going to stick

00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:45,279
around what isn't but about ten years

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,480
ago Mike Stonebraker and some of his

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,309
colleagues published this article and

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,220
you know suggesting that at the time

00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:58,449
right we're really Hadoop was kind of

00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:01,779
what they were talking about that you

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:03,220
know MapReduce and no SQL databases were

00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:06,519
going to be a big step backwards for

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,139
database technology right they made a

00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:12,189
lot of good arguments they caught a lot

00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:14,739
of flack a lot of heat from people who

00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:16,160
disagreed with us certainly the the

00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:17,300
history of

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,970
success that people have had with these

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,220
databases the amount of venture capital

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:26,690
investment kind of end user investment

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:28,190
has proven them wrong in ways but you

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,170
know I look back on it and I think that

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:34,640
it was actually quite a big step forward

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:36,370
and you know while you know they were

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,750
right and that a lot of us went through

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:42,110
lessons that learned lessons again that

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,760
the sequel pioneers Postgres and my

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,800
sequel and Oracle had learned micro

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,960
sequel server had learned over decades

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:52,580
we learned those over again over the

00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:55,580
last ten years but it did help us learn

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:57,920
that things like acid you know wasn't an

00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:02,150
absolute necessity we could learn we

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,170
could live with eventual consistency we

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,020
learned that we could live without

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:08,480
sequel access even though it made

00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:11,450
integration and staffing projects a

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,910
little bit harder okay and so I think

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,280
those learnings plus the source code all

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,750
the open source code that that got

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,730
created over the last ten years is

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,200
really helping to create a new

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:26,360
generation of databases yet again okay

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,760
so if we look at you know we kind of

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,920
went from monolithic sequel to

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,230
distributed sequel to nois distributed

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,710
no SQL and now we're coming back to

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,650
distributed sequel okay and what's going

00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,990
on now or companies like or open source

00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:45,560
projects like cockroach DB and create DB

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,450
are born out of kind of sequel and no

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,960
sequel at both of these companies and

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:53,300
more to come or more that are coming are

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,340
written you know distributed sequel

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,280
layers but instead of using kind of

00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:01,490
traditional relational storage and

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,580
indexing beneath that the query planners

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:10,340
an execution layer they've taken code

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:12,230
from no SQL databases in cockroach DB's

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,810
case they took from rocks TV and they

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:18,050
really specialize in cross center

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:21,680
transactional processing Creek DB took

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:25,760
leucine right so we every shard

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,170
in Krait DB is a lucien engine so for

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,510
those of you in the data center it's

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,700
kind of like got a database

00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:36,380
can do time-series analog analytics all

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,970
in one now so I think the next you know

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,310
one of the predictions and one of things

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,270
that you'll see increasingly over the

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,230
next few years is no sequel and sequel

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,050
technologies coming together in a much

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,890
tighter way than just a sequel interface

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:57,620
to a no SQL database for translation

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:59,420
there let's talk a little bit what's

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,900
changing in the business and what's

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,280
changing in application development and

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:07,250
whether you know it or not everybody

00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,590
here who works in a data center who's

00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:12,290
built or runs systems monitoring and

00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,090
alerting is actually inspired a lot of

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,420
what's going on in the business but when

00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,680
we talk about the operational brain

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,210
we're really talking about the

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,700
development of applications that are

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:27,200
becoming more predictive right they're

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:29,990
using machine learning artificial

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,230
intelligence algorithms data science to

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:37,270
go from applications that are simply a

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:40,100
user interface into a database but now

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:43,040
actually will predict write or even

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,900
control things in the business or things

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:50,680
in the factory things you know products

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:53,810
and so this is going to have a profound

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,460
impact on the kinds of databases and

00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:01,190
what's going on with data in the data

00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:06,550
centers one example company help law

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:11,690
which makes all the bottles plastic ones

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:15,830
180 factories around the world and they

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:18,530
they had a problem with turnover or a

00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,330
workforce people hiring people in the

00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,790
factories training them on how to use

00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,320
this you know specialize in technical

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,690
equipment bottle making equipment and

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,070
then they would go find other jobs so it

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,670
was very expensive to train people and

00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:33,740
then having to rehire them and the head

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,300
of operations in for Apple in the US had

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,220
this idea he's like you know we these

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,190
machines generates so much data you know

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,840
each every factory's got 900 different

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,240
types of sensors running and those data

00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,950
those are mostly used by the machines

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,960
themselves to you know kick defects out

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,210
of the process he's like what if we

00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:58,950
could take that data and you know put it

00:15:54,210 --> 00:16:02,190
in a room full of monitors for this guy

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,900
right and he could instead of walking

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,480
around the factory looking at machines

00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,330
by eye listening to them watching them

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,280
checking dials and stuff he's he's

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,310
provided with information from all those

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,730
sensors okay kind of like some of you

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:21,240
are watching or at least waiting for

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:26,280
page of duty to inform you that there's

00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:29,630
something going not quite right okay so

00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:35,310
they started to feed all this data to

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:37,200
into operations and you know they they

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,430
tried using sequel server they felt like

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,430
that was the right thing to do since

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,590
they're big Microsoft shop and they just

00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:46,890
that's what their developers knew so

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,900
some poor person had to create 900

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,320
different tables one for each type of

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,030
sensor reading and it didn't work so

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,110
well you know they they ended up

00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:00,470
switching to another database to get the

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,210
real-time visibility they needed so that

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,060
these dashboards were refresh and just a

00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,740
you know about a third of a second

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,090
instead of an hour which is about the

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,000
same time it took the guy to do a lap

00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:13,950
around the factory but what's really

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,780
cool here is that this using data this

00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,780
way when he sees a problem and it can

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,910
just be a it doesn't have to be severe

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,680
like a machine has stopped running it

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:26,790
can just be a machine that's using more

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:28,320
plastic than normal right if it uses too

00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,060
much plastic the bottles are defective

00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,280
it doesn't use enough they're also

00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,590
defective but they want to be using just

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,440
over the just enough line otherwise

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:40,650
they're wasting raw materials but when

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:45,480
he sees those he he's like a human pager

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:47,640
duty so he'll get in touch with a person

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,190
on the factory floor who now does not

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,740
need to be as trained and that expert is

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,860
as this guy and they connect through

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,679
augmented reality the microsoft hololens

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,210
so he can see

00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,799
the person on the factory floor is

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,090
seeing and annotate their field of

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:04,029
vision and bring up videos and manuals

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,539
and step them through the repair of the

00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:07,059
machine

00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:08,799
you know replacing parts machine

00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,159
adjustments and stuff like that so it's

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,139
very cool and it's had a huge impact on

00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,369
the way on Apple is profitability and

00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:17,440
the way they manage their their

00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:22,600
workforce and kind of retain knowledge

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,190
through through data so but that should

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,619
sound a little bit familiar from anybody

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,389
who's in the systems monitoring

00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:33,279
standpoint it's just like systems

00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:34,539
monitoring for bottles okay so this is

00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,710
really going to change the kind of

00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:41,789
weight data's you know what and how much

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:45,460
data comes into a data center right so

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:48,909
unlike logs from a server and systems

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,759
monitoring you know the the or even you

00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:53,919
know the IOT or industrial IOT industry

00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,860
for route data from machines is very

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,889
complex the tens or hundreds of data

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:04,809
points per per JSON object and like I

00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:07,509
said 900 different messages so you know

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:09,279
the ability to process that kind of

00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:13,600
information many data points per model

00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:15,279
right or per machine per day to combine

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,850
that with information like who was

00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,490
operating you know HR data like who is

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,619
operating the machine at the time

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:26,200
natural language processing right what

00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:28,330
have what can we learn from notes that

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,860
the operators have entered in different

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,029
languages same machines around the world

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,450
but different languages that they're

00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:37,350
typing in sometimes you know about

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:40,299
problems and fixes to those problems

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,970
material suppliers you know a lot of

00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,619
returns on a bottle that could have been

00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:48,580
something about the manufacturing

00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:50,259
process but more likely the the the

00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,869
quality of the ingredients or materials

00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:55,389
they used okay so a lot more data coming

00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:59,740
in data integration it's going to become

00:19:55,389 --> 00:20:03,039
a bigger challenge for the business and

00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:05,740
the data center as well okay so simply

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,600
put just get ready for what we call just

00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,950
a firehose of weird data that needs to

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,320
be analyzed in in real time

00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,539
okay almost always in the cloud but

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:19,159
sometimes out at the edge like a table

00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:20,419
its they have central database with all

00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,850
this stuff they analyze but they also

00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:26,080
have this stack at each of their hundred

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:29,600
and eighty factories for local analytics

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,010
okay I have three more predictions

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,340
that's probably gonna go a little quick

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,539
today so you can get out early okay so I

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,850
think just some of the other things I

00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:40,149
think are going to change in database

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,260
technology I think that middleware and

00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:45,019
database servers are going to start to

00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:48,799
blend okay if you think about some

00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:52,159
things like Message Queuing okay which

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:55,250
was invented what 10 15 years ago maybe

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,309
more those were invented because

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,380
databases couldn't be you couldn't

00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:01,940
depend on a database to run all day you

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,669
certainly couldn't depend on the

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,710
database to process tens of thousands of

00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:09,289
messages per second you know so you had

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:13,059
the message queuing which kept stuff

00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:15,649
safe even if the database wasn't ok but

00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:18,440
databases today you know the scale out

00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:22,370
it's easy to build replication you know

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,529
kind of very high uptime very high

00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,649
ingestion rates with eventual

00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:30,889
consistency and things like that so

00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:32,779
databases like crate DB will embed mqt

00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,299
we've embedded an MQTT listener and

00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:38,919
crate so there's really kind of

00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:42,049
eliminates the need for separate MTT

00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:48,110
MQTT broker in between crate and the

00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:53,179
data sources prediction to time series

00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:54,559
databases this is kind of funny I mean

00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:56,510
they're useful they're interesting

00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,139
there's a definite need for time series

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,490
data management I've seen these come and

00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:03,200
go over the years there's always a new

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,000
need for time series but none of these

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,490
ever really gained commercial traction I

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,350
think in the data center you know use

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,909
what you will is more kind of for

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:14,240
investors like why are you putting

00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:16,159
twenty million dollars into these you

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,010
know there's there's very little it's

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,170
kind of a small data problem and really

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:24,700
small

00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:27,670
market for these and I think the one

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,400
exception is Prometheus which you know

00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,930
has such a great foothold in systems

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,300
monitoring right kind of event and

00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:37,600
metric management and it's such a great

00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,760
fit for the use that it's I think that's

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,800
just going to end up being the de facto

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,380
standard and really is in terms of all

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,750
the different system software that

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:51,970
already supports Prometheus as an

00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:54,070
endpoint okay and the last thing I just

00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,350
think you know sequel is going to

00:22:54,070 --> 00:23:00,280
continue to dominate right I think it

00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:02,320
wavered a little bit with the no SQL era

00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,740
but you know by my last count the number

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,710
of no SQL or sequel developers just on

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,960
LinkedIn people had the skill sequel

00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:14,470
server to MongoDB specifically was

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,120
around 45 to 1 right so throw a rock in

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,150
here but you know how many people knows

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:23,400
sequel or have used it show of hands

00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:25,470
okay how many people have used C sequel

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,290
C right

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:32,380
Cassandra's right not as many so it's

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,610
easy to staff sequel projects and you

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,820
know I think with the exception of

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,350
H MongoDB which is really reached what

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:42,220
I'll call escape velocity and has a

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:43,930
critical mass of users behind it and

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,550
will probably be like the marklogic

00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:54,070
which started as an XML database of like

00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:57,220
2025 but but there's really as the

00:23:54,070 --> 00:24:00,250
sequel databases not just new ones like

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,840
cockroach and crate DB but you know even

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:04,540
the advances that continue to happen in

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,070
my sequel and you know stuff work the

00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:10,660
Percona and others do

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:12,250
Postgres that you know the capabilities

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,200
you get in know SQL just going to kind

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:20,530
of become less and less valuable to

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:22,600
people so yeah I think that yeah so I

00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:26,190
don't think you need to be in as big a

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,760
rush to you know brush up on no sequel

00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,400
databases so much

00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,870
I think just final thoughts really you

00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,900
know kind of for people in the data

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:38,480
center is it may not be obvious but from

00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:42,230
somebody who's kind of up to his eyes

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,110
and this machine data management and AI

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,860
and IOT application development a lot of

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,330
what companies like outlet are doing to

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,340
monitor and manage and predict and

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:56,350
control and automate the way they make

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,580
bottles right or energy drinks or

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:01,130
what-have-you

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,900
they're really strong parallels to

00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:06,560
what's going on in the data center right

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:08,810
so I think a lot of what you know the

00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,820
technologies and practices especially

00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,580
the open source ones that have been

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,350
applied in the data center to keep you

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,390
know IT infrastructure up and running

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,210
are really starting to be applied

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:23,390
towards physical things and other parts

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:25,640
of the business so whenever you hear

00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,140
something that doesn't feel like it's

00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,910
working optimally for the business

00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,440
outside of IT you know start to think

00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,910
about you know kind of apply your

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:38,240
systems monitoring and you know

00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:40,010
availability security brains towards

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,740
those problems and I'll bet you a lot

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:48,130
you'll find some analogs and some

00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:48,130
solutions you can apply any questions

00:25:53,260 --> 00:26:04,970
crickets are there any questions left

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:07,040
okay get out early yeah I think so

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,300
thanks thank you Andy pleasure thanks

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,099
everybody
