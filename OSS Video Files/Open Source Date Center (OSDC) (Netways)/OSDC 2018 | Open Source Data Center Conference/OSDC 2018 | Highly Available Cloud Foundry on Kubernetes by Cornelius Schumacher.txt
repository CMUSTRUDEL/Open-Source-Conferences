Title: OSDC 2018 | Highly Available Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes by Cornelius Schumacher
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: OSDC 2018 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	This presentation will show how Cloud Foundry, the popular Platform as a Service framework, is deployed and configured to run in a highly available fashion on Kubernetes. It will show how to avoid single points of failures using Kubernetes features like stateful sets, readiness and liveness probes, etc. This includes how high availability extends to applications deployed by the end users of Cloud Foundry so they donâ€™t have to worry about downtime. The presentation will include a demo of a disruptive agent simulating failures across the Kubernetes nodes and containers, while user applications are still alive and healthy. This presentation shows a real-life production use case for Kubernetes. This can be used as an example and to learn about the high-availability related features of Kubernetes. It also presents how the Kubernetes stack can be extended with Cloud Foundry to also cover the use case of Platform as a Service.
