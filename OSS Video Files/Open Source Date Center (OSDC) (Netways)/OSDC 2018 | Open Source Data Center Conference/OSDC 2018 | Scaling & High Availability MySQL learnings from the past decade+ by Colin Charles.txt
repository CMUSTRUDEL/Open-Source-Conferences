Title: OSDC 2018 | Scaling & High Availability MySQL learnings from the past decade+ by Colin Charles
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: OSDC 2018 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	The MySQL world is full of tradeoffs and choosing a High Availability (HA) solution is no exception. This session aims to look at all of the alternatives in an unbiased nature. While the landscape will be covered, including but not limited to MySQL replication, MHA, DRBD, Galera Cluster, etc. the focus of the talk will be what is recommended for today, and what to look out for. Thus, this will include extensive deep-dive coverage of ProxySQL, semi-sync replication, Orchestrator, MySQL Router, and Galera Cluster variants like Percona XtraDB Cluster and MariaDB Galera Cluster. I will also touch on group replication.
