Title: OSDC 2018 | Distributed Monitoring by Gianluca Arbezzano
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: OSDC 2018 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Modern software development is increasingly taking a “microservice” approach that has resulted in an explosion of complexity at the network level. We have more applications running distributed across different datacenters. Distributed tracing, events, and metrics are essential for observing and understanding modern microservice architectures.
This talk is a deep dive on how to monitor your distributed system. You will get tools, methodologies, and experiences that will help you to realize what your applications expose and how to get value out from all these information.
Gianluca Arbezzano, SRE at InfluxData will share how to monitor a distributed system, how to switch from a more traditional monitoring approach to observability. Stay focused on the server’s role and not on the hostname because it’s not really important anymore, our servers or containers are fast moving part and it’s easy to detach it from the right in case of trouble than call the server by name as a cute puppet. How to design a SLO for your core services and now to iterate on them. Instrument your services with tracing using tools like Zipkin or Jaeger to measure latency between in your network.
