Description: 
	Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates the building of analytical models. By using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, computers are able to find hidden insights without the help of explicit programming. These insights bring tremendous benefits into many different domains. For business users, in particular, these insights help organizations improve customer experience, become more competitive, and respond much faster to opportunities or threats. The availability of very powerful in-memory computing platforms, such as Apache Ignite, means that more organizations can benefit from machine learning today. In this presentation we will look at some of the main components of Apache Ignite, such as the Compute Grid, Data Grid and the Machine Learning Grid. Through examples, attendees will learn how Apache Ignite can be used for data analysis.
