Title: OSDC 2018 | Spicing up VMWare with Ansible and InSpec by M. Schurz & S. Gumprich
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: OSDC 2018 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	VMWare is a common hypervisor choice in large organizations, and it comes with a zoo of additional tools, options and licenses. But once you add a little bit of OpenSource to the mix, things start to get interesting. There are open APIs which integrate well with Tools like Ansible and InSpec. So it is easy to write your own scripts to verify a configuration or harden a ESX host. We will show you, how we automated our deployment, what problems we encountered and how we added some nice features.
