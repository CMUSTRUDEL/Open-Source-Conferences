Description: 
	TLS 1.3 is so different from its predecessors, some argue it should’ve been called TLS 2.0. TLS 1.3 comes with a number of new features that may or may not benefit datacenter deployment, depending on the use case. It also streamlines key establishment, making TLS 1.3 simpler, and more secure. It may be the best TLS so far, but in spite of its simplicity fitting it into the current GnuTLS API has been no easy task. This talk gives an overview of what to expect from TLS 1.3, tours around GnuTLS, its interfaces and its internal structure, and explains how we went on redesigning the current API to support TLS 1.3, without breaking anything and of course keeping backward compatibility. Our design principle: TLS 1.3 is simple – so should the interface.
