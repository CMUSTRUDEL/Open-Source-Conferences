Title: OSDC 2018 | Extending Terraform for Anything as Code by Mitchell Hashimoto
Publication date: 2018-06-22
Playlist: OSDC 2018 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Terraform is a powerful Infrastructure as Code tool for declaratively building and maintaining complex infrastructures on one or multiple cloud systems. Additionally, Terraform supports over 80 non-infrastructure providers! This talk will dive into the abstract design of Terraform and show how it can be used concretely for completely non-infrastructure use cases, including examples of these uses in the real world. Weâ€™ll also touch on how you can extend Terraform to manage anything with an API.
