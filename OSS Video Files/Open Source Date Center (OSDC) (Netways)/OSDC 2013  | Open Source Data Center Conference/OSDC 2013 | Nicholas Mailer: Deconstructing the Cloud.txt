Title: OSDC 2013 | Nicholas Mailer: Deconstructing the Cloud
Publication date: 2015-01-13
Playlist: OSDC 2013  | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Over the last few years, many people have been beguiled by the term "cloud computing". My talk will discuss how this term suffers from a dangerous ambiguity, which can subvert the very freedoms and flexibility that Open Source and Free Software provides. I provide examples, and discuss how Free Software and Open Source principles can be extended across a datacentre full of private "clouds" to avoid the problems that will otherwise become increasingly serious in our industry.
