Title: OSDC 2014: Jordan Sissel - Find Happiness in your Logs
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Got logs? With so much technology powering your business, you need tools to help you identify problems and analyze past behavior. Apache 2.0-licensed Elasticsearch ELK stack is here to help you process, store, and visualize any kind of logging data, in real time, from any source imaginable!

Log management seems so boring. Log rotation, retention policy, grep, yuck!  What are your servers are doing? Did last night's upgrade break anything?  How your users are interacting with your products? Why did the site go down last weekend?

Get ready to turn your log pains into awesome visual insights and more!

BAM! Elasticsearch ELK! ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.  Each of these three are lovely, open source projects that, together, give you and your business log management superpowers.

This talk will primarily be done in three parts: open source and community, technology, and use cases.

* The first part will introduce each project and its success as open source software, most notably through supportive and open communities.
* The second part will discuss the each project and the problems solved.
* The third (and most exciting!) part will highlight a variety of use cases and problem that real humans are using Elasticsearch ELK to solve. Live demos of some use cases will be provided.

Attendees will leave the presentation totally full of excitement about this toolset and bursting with fresh ideas about how to tackle their sour logging problems.
