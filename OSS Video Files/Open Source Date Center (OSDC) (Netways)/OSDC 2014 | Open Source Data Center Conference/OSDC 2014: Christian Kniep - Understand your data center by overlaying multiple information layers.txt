Title: OSDC 2014: Christian Kniep - Understand your data center by overlaying multiple information layers
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Today's data center managers are burdened by a lack of aligned information of multiple layers. Work-flow events like 'job starts' aligned with performance metrics and events extracted from log facilities are low-hanging fruit that is on the edge to become use-able due to open-source software like Graphite, StatsD, logstash and alike.
This talk aims to show off the benefits of merging multiple layers of information within an InfiniBand cluster by using use-cases for level 1/2/3 personnel.
