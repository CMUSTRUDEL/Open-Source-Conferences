Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	System DataBase‚Äù (SysDB) is a multi-backend system management and inventory collection service. It may be used to (continuously) collect information about your systems from various backends (inventory services, monitoring services, etc. like Nagios, Puppet, collectd) and provides a unique interface to access the information independent of the active backends. This is done by storing and mapping the backend objects to generic objects and correlating the attributes to create a single hierarchical view of your infrastructure. This way, all important information about your systems is accessible from a central location allowing for use-cases such as central dashboards, cross-link monitoring or inventory information, identify missing pieces in your system configuration, and much more.
This talk provides an overview over SysDB and its features as well as sample use-cases. The project is still in an early development stage but already usable. The talk also covers future directions and further integration with existing services.
