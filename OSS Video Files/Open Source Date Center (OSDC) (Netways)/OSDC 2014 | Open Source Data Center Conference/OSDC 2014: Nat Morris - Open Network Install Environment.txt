Title: OSDC 2014: Nat Morris - Open Network Install Environment
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	ONIE defines an open source “install environment” that runs on this management subsystem utilizing facilities in a Linux/BusyBox environment. This environment allows end-users and channel partners to install the target network OS as part of data center provisioning, in the fashion that servers are provisioned.
ONIE enables switch hardware suppliers, distributors and resellers to manage their operations based on a small number of hardware SKUs. This in turn creates economies of scale in manufacturing, distribution, stocking, and RMA enabling a thriving ecosystem of both network hardware and operating system alternatives.
