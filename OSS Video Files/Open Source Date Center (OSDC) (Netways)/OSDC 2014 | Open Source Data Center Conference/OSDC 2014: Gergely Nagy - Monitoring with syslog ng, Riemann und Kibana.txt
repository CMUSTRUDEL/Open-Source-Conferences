Title: OSDC 2014: Gergely Nagy - Monitoring with syslog ng, Riemann und Kibana
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	In any data center, one will have a lot of machines, and even more applications, plenty of them legacy applications with little to no built-in monitoring capabilities. But even when monitoring is built in, quite often, it just provides basic building blocks.
In this talk, it will be shown how to tie a syslog-ng based logging solution to the Riemann monitoring system, and use Kibana to make sense of both logging and monitoring data. The presentation will suggest solutions for extracting data from various applications, ways to transform them into useful metrics, and will - of course - also touch the subject of what exactly useful metrics are to begin with. A live demo of all things discussed will be shown at the end.
