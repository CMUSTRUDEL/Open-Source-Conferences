Title: OSDC 2014: Michael Renner - Secure encryption in a wiretapped future
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Since the beginning of publications by Edward Snowden last year many of the presumedly exaggerated threat models in cryptography have become reality. When operating sensitive services it's more likely than not that communcation data will be tapped at large carriers as well as internet exchanges and stored indefinitily - this calls for strong and forward-secure encryption.
On the other hand we're faced with the problem that much of the software we're using in the datacenter today is not very secure when it comes to default encryption settings. On top of that, most developers and system administrators are not very fluent in the basic workings of encryption systems.
The talk will give an introduction to SSL/TLS and explain how to check for weaknesses in existing services with tools like nmap, sslscan and sslyze. For common daemons like apache, nginx, exim, postfix and dovecot best practice on improving cryptographic strength will be discussed.
