Title: OSDC 2014: Jonathan Clarke - Rudder
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	As a Configuration Management [CM] "champion", trying to gain traction in your environment can be challenging when the level of expertise necessary is in short supply. We built Rudder so that the CM champion would not need to clone themselves. Instead, he or she is able to use a tool to manage configuration data, expose key parameters to the rest of their team, reduce complexity of configuration changes, and put in place role-based workflow for change control.

Rudder is an open source configuration management solution, using lightweight agents (based on CFEngine) controlled via a central management point. Using Rudder, I will show how this approach enables the team to fully participate in the practice of Configuration Management, keep track of changes and history, exploit change access / control, and facilitate knowledge sharing (sharing intentions in design via desired configuration state, maintaining a record of preferred configurations) without intervention of CM champion.
