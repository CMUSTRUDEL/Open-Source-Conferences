Title: OSDC 2014: Tobias Schwab - Continuous Delivery with Docker
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Docker took the ops world by storm in 2013. Based on the same technology that powers Heroku (container virtualization) docker makes it easy to create private and data center agnostic PAAS architectures.

Container images created with docker contain the full application stack and enable rapid deployments and fast auto-scaling without any external dependencies at deploy time. They allow running the exact same configuration of OS, package dependencies, application code and configuration files in all environments and on all servers.

In this talk I want to present how we implement continuous delivery of a Ruby on Rails Application (1414.de) using docker. I will give a short introduction to docker and talk about best practices for production usage. Other topics which will be covered in the docker context are:

- image distribution with private registries
- multi docker host orchestration
- configuration management
- logging and metrics
- load balancing and failover
