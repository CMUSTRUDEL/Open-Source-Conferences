Title: OSDC 2014: Christian Patsch - System Orchestration with Capistrano and Puppet
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	With Puppet being several years on the market, there are still many different ways to implement the technology in data center environments. In contrast to the centralized puppetmaster-approach, some scenarios may rather need a decentralized solution due to technical or organizational requirements.
Using Puppet together with the remote server administration tool Capistrano is one way to fulfill these, and examples from an implemented project with these tools will demonstrate which advantages can be achieved and which obstacles have to be considered. A comparison with other proven approaches will deliver recommendations for future installations.
