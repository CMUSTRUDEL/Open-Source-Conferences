Title: OSDC 2014: Jan Piet Mens - Configuration Management with Ansible
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Ansible is a simple configuration management and command execution framework for push and pull deployments for Unix/Linux systems using an existing SSH infrastructure. It's particularly easy to deploy because neither does it require an agent on managed nodes (a newish implementation of Python suffices) nor does it require a complex PKI. We show you how to quickly get started using Ansible for ad-hoc tasks, discuss some of its modules and introduce you to Ansible's playbooks and variables. We show you how to run Ansible as a normal user (non-root), how to configure inventory data, and give you sundry tips on using Ansible effectively. If you prefer a pull-based setup, we show you how to implement that as well. We'll discuss roles, use of variables and lookup plugins.
