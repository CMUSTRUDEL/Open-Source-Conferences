Title: OSDC 2014: Colin Charles - Automated MySQL failover with MHA
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	With the MySQL master-slave replication topology, it is nice to have  automated failover in the event the master fails rather than a  manual process. In this talk, we go through the tool MHA, talk about the potential pitfalls and gotchas of automatic failovers, how you can use regular MySQL replication (either asynchronous or semi-synchronous) to achieve high availability and more. We also cover virtual IP failover with the integration of Pacemaker +  Corosync. MySQL 5.6 and greater include global transaction IDs  (GTIDs) and a new set of failover tools and we discuss how this compares to what MHA provides.
