Title: OSDC 2014: Andreas Schmidt - Testing server infrastructure with serverspec
Publication date: 2015-01-05
Playlist: OSDC 2014 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Companies that focus on cloud infrastructures for both developing and running their applications are likely to have the highest benefit of test driven infrastructure tools such as configuration management and their spec-oriented testing counterparts.
However many enterprises have not moved to the cloud yet.
Often limited by contracts, regulations or security considerations, they too are in need of testing their infrastructure that service providers built for them.
The talk shows approaches to infrastructure testing and demonstrates the use of serverspec (http://serverspec.org/).
