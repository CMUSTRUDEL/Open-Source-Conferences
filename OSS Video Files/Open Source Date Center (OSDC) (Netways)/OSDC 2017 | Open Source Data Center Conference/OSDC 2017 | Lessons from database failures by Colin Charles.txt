Title: OSDC 2017 | Lessons from database failures by Colin Charles
Publication date: 2017-05-31
Playlist: OSDC 2017 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Lets learn from MySQL failures at scale, because we tie in the topic of High Availability, in where people are thinking about geographical redundancy, and even things like automatic failover. In the talk there will be case study material, e.g. where automatic failure caused a site to go offline, where a social network started of with not using fully automated failovers but evolved, etc. How is the MySQL world making things better, for example by allowing you to use semi-synchronous replication to run fully scalable services. The talk starts off with an even almost stupid example of how a business died due to incorrect MySQL backup procedures. It will go on to talk about security and encryption at rest as well. So a mix of problems from the field, big “fail whales”, and how you should avoid them by properly architecting solutions.
