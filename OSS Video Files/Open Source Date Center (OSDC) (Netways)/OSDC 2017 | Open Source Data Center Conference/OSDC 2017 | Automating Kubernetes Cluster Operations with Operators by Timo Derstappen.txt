Description: 
	At Giant Swarm, we manage Kubernetes clusters for customers 24/7, both on-premises and in the cloud. That means we do not just set something up and hand it over, but we actually take care that itâ€™s operational and up-to-date at all times.
In this talk Timo explains how Giant Swarm are using Operators to codify all operational tasks of managing Kubernetes cluster and distributed applications on top. The operators manage PKI infrastructures, networks, VMs and storage both on-premises and in the cloud. There have been a lots of challenges and learnings in the past year and Timo would like to share them with you.
