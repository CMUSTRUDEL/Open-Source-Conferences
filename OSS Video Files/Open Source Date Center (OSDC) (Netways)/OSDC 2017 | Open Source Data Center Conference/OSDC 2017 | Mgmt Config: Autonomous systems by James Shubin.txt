Title: OSDC 2017 | Mgmt Config: Autonomous systems by James Shubin
Publication date: 2017-06-02
Playlist: OSDC 2017 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Mgmt is a next gen config management tool that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems. Three of the main design features of the tool include:
* Parallel execution
* Event driven mechanism
* Distributed architecture
This presentation will briefly introduce the tool and spend most of the time presenting and demoing some of the newer features in the project. We'll present some of the new resources (virt, password, etc) new features (libified mgmt, send/recv, DSL) and how these can be used to build autonomous systems. Finally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.
