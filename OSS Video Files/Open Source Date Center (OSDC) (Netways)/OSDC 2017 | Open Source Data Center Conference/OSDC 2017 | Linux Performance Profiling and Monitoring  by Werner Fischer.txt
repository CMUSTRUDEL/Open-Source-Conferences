	Nowadays system administrators have great choices when it comes down to Linux performance profiling and monitoring. The challenge is to pick the appropriate tools and interpret their results correctly.
This talk is a chance to take a tour through various performance profiling and benchmarking tools, focusing on their benefit for every sysadmin.
More than 25 different tools are presented. Ranging from well known tools like strace, iostat, tcpdump or vmstat to new features like Linux tracepoints or perf_events. You will also learn which tools can be monitored by Icinga and which monitoring plugins are already available for that.
At the end the goal is to gather reference points to look at, whenever you are faced with performance problems.
Take the chance to close your knowledge gaps and learn how to get the most out of your system.
