Title: OSDC 2019: Virtualisation in Docker, using KVM as Hypervisor by Kosisochukwu Anyanwu
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	There are multiple reasons one might want to run VMs inside containers. One scenario could be running VMs as part of a CI pipeline which executes all build steps inside containers. This can be useful, for example, for emulating bare-metal deployments. In this talk, I will demonstrate how to create a virtual machine inside a Docker container using KVM as the hypervisor driver, explain how the container needs to be configured in terms of privileges and discuss some of the challenges involved.
