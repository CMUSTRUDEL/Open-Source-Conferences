Title: OSDC 2019: DevOps in a containerized world by Martin Alfke
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	DevOps describes the culture of communication and collaboration between IT Development and IT Operations departments. Usually this covers system setup, application deployment and all the surrounding tools like CI, metrics and alerting. A core element has always been IT automation using configuration management and CI/CD. But how do we do DevOps in a containerized world? Do we still need configuration management? Is there still collaboration possible? Or iare containers the DevOps killer? In my talk I draw a picture on responsibilities, does and donâ€™ts when it comes to developers and operations working within a container runtime platform. I want to show where we still have DevOps and where we pass responsibilities to a single department only and what kind of security borders we have at hand to work separately but with trust.
