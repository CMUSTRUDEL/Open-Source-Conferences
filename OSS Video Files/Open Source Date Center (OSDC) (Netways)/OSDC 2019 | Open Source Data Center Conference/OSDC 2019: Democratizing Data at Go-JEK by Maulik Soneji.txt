Title: OSDC 2019: Democratizing Data at Go-JEK by Maulik Soneji
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Having grown 6666x in the last 3 years; the data generated has grown exponentially. As a Data Engineer at GoJEK, we faced the issue with having our complete team managing infrastructure requests. This led us to create an internal portal for other teams to self-provision their data. This talk is divided into two parts. In the first part, I will cover details about how we have scaled our data engineering infrastructure to manage the scale of more than 40 million messages per day. I will explain the data consumption, aggregation, monitoring and cold storage. This will also cover details about how we scaled our infrastructure to achieve the scale that we are at today. In the second part, I will cover how we created our internal portal for infrastructure orchestration. The infrastructure backed by kubernetes enables teams to self-provision data infrastructure without any supervision.
