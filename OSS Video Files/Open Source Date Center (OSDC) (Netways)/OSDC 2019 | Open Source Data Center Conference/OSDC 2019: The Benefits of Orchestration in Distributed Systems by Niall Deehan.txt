Title: OSDC 2019: The Benefits of Orchestration in Distributed Systems by Niall Deehan
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Integrating microservices and taming distributed systems is hard. In this talk I will present three challenges we observed in real-life projects and discuss how to avoid them using Open Source orchestration. Communication is complex. With everything being distributed failures are normal, so you need sophisticated failure handling strategies (e.g. stateful retry). A synchronicity requires you to handle timeouts. This is not only about milliseconds, systems get much more resilient when you can wait for minutes, hours or even longer. Distributed transactions cannot simply be delegated to protocols like XA. So, you need to solve the requirement to retain consistency in case of failures. I will not only use slides but demonstrate concrete source code examples available on GitHub.
