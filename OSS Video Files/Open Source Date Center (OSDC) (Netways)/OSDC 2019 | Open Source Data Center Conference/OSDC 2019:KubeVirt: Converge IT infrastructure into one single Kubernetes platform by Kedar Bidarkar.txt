Title: OSDC 2019:KubeVirt: Converge IT infrastructure into one single Kubernetes platform by Kedar Bidarkar
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	We will dive into KubeVirt and see how we could create and manage VMs in Kubernetes In this session we will talk about what is KubeVirt and how it works on a kubernetes platform. KubeVirt allows users to create and manage virtual machines within a Kubernetes Cluster.
This session will be covering the following topics:

• KubeVirt Installation
• Basic KubeVirt objects and components
• How to deploy and manage virtual machines
• KubeVirt Storage
• KubeVirt Networking

Benefits :
Kubernetes is a well established container platform, but migrating applications/services to containers is not always easy. KubeVirt allows in such situations to migrate virtual machine based workloads to the same platform where the containers are already running, thus helping converge IT Infrastructure into one single platform, Kubernetes.
