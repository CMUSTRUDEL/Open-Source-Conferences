Title: OSDC 2019: 5 Steps to a DevOps Transformation by Dan Barker
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	In this session, we’ll walk through the five steps to transformational change that I’ve found to be important. These are really applicable to any continuously improving organization or any large amount of change in a system.

• Establish the vision
• Create shared experiences
• Educate, educate, educate
• Find evangelists
• Get feedback

I’ll elaborate on each item with methods I’ve used in real transformations at multiple companies. I’ll also describe how these all tie into the devops culture, which is really the transformation that’s occurring within the company. What will the audience get? The audience will walk away with an understanding of how to bring and manage a large change to a company. They’ll have some examples to discuss and ideas to implement. They’ll also have some additional resources for learning more.

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:24,810
thank you yes I'm Dan Barker I'm a chief

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:28,050
architect for Archer it's a product

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,720
around risk management that RSA security

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,450
offers RSA security is a Dell

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,640
technologies company if anybody here

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,360
likes running Linux on a desktop I'm

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,969
wearing a Sputnik project shirt so go

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,579
buy an awesome Ubuntu laptop from Dell

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,230
that's the only promotion or mention

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,379
I'll have for RSA and Dell the rest the

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,320
talk so we're going to talk a little bit

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,199
about some of my experiences not just at

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,530
RSA but several other companies related

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,129
to DevOps transformation in this talk

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,409
devops transformation is somewhat of a

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,920
placeholder where any type of large

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,590
change in a system often requires

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,210
similar types of steps to be able to

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,700
enact that change at a larger

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,670
organization smaller organizations

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,560
require this as well but maybe to a

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,970
lesser extent if there's 20 people in

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,850
your organization is probably a lot

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:29,970
easier to make a change than if there's

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:32,430
2,000 or 20,000 so there's a a quote

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,189
here that's I don't know if it's

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,670
attributable to anybody so it could be

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,009
mine I'd I never claimed any quote that

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,409
I utter because it's probably from

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,509
someone else it's not what we believe

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:51,390
it's what we do that defines our culture

00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:54,420
so that means that I'm sure a lot of you

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,790
see companies that espouse their values

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,259
and assume that those those truths they

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,390
espouse are self-evident in the

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,040
organization and then when you get there

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,850
you find out that the behaviors that

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,680
they actually have in the company have a

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,479
different set of values attributed to

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,580
them and that's really what people

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,500
follow is based on the behaviors and

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,500
we'll talk a little bit more about

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,270
so the first part and the thing that I

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,040
think is the most important is

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:31,020
establishing the vision in an

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,040
organization so this is a quote from

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,770
John Carmack

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:41,760
who here knows who John Carmack is one

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:44,040
person two three four okay so he's

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,400
probably hid so you'll know him from his

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,610
work so he was a co-founder of Ede

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,750
software and was the lead developer on

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,340
Wolfenstein 3d doom quake many of you

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,510
are in my same age bracket so you grew

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:03,150
up with those and loved them dearly and

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:07,530
and now everyone is is realizing who he

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:10,830
is so he says that a I don't know why

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:16,050
there's a timer that's not started Thank

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:19,970
You Logitech a strong team can take any

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:23,850
crazy vision and turn it into reality

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:28,830
now he said crazy vision not a bad

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,690
vision or an ill-conceived vision and to

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,200
me that's because a vision creates

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,660
empowerment so a good vision will allow

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,450
a team to be empowered and act on that

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,010
vision

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,890
the first response I usually get to a

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,330
presentation like this is but I'm not a

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,800
leader

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:52,290
and I would say with that attitude

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,740
you're right so you need to know that

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,170
you are probably leading someone today

00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:00,570
whether you know it or not especially if

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,070
you have a more senior title likely

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,950
everyone who doesn't have that senior

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:08,400
title is following your example I

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,110
usually look at how someone uses a tool

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,930
so if you have a senior administrator on

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,570
a tool everyone else who is not senior

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,460
on that tool will often try to emulate

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:21,690
the person who is the most senior on

00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:25,380
that tool which also reinforces bad

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,540
behaviors sometimes but you are leading

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,210
someone

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:34,170
and so that means that you you do have

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,880
power in organizations and what I've

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,310
found is that the people who are the

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,710
closest to the work often have the most

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,930
power because you get to translate all

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,000
the things that come down from higher

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,330
leadership areas the more formal

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,750
leadership models one of the things you

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:55,230
can do if you are not a formal leader is

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,810
you can give feedback to the more formal

00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,310
leaders or to leaders that are higher up

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,030
in the organization and have a different

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:05,490
context this is often hard to give harsh

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,650
critical feedback a lot of people fear

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,680
for their jobs but in a good

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,980
organization that is as a generative

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:18,720
culture this should be acceptable and

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:22,110
invited by teams by leaders you can

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,530
provide a vision for your own area so

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,960
this is if you are in charge of a

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,120
certain tool or set of tools you may

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,330
provide a smaller vision just for that

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,680
area that your team or some others

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,540
around that team can act on this vision

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,840
should be in line with company goals

00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,550
generally so that it can get funding but

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,890
you can also make it in line with goals

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,780
of others in the team so I worked at a

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,030
company called Cerner it's a large

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,210
electronic medical record company in the

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:57,240
US and we sell internationally I don't

00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:01,470
know if anybody's ever used it but we

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:07,880
have some fairly critical requirements

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:10,790
on being able to you know help help our

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,170
customers customers the patient survive

00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,170
and so there's a lot of criticality

00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:20,220
there but we were still very empowered

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:22,560
to do what we thought was best to effect

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,350
change in the organization and improve

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,930
the lives of the patients and so one of

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:31,320
the things I did was I was running the

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:34,080
CI CD system and the organization there

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,600
was it's now like 35,000 people or

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,880
something and at the time it was 15 or

00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,980
20 thousand so it was a very large

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,940
organization it was spread over

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:48,540
many different cities and countries and

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:51,960
I took on an initiative that was I was a

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,270
year in as a software engineer so I was

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,550
not a leader by any means I just

00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,370
happened to be on a team that had

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,870
support for all the CICE tools and the

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,900
cloud platform tools for this

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:07,200
organization and I went out and started

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,940
to work with other people around the

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,610
company who had a stake in this and

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:16,080
align their goals towards the same

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:18,180
vision I was using docker and mezzos it

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,520
was like the first release mezzos ever

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,650
had that had docker on it which is like

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,310
0.21 or something

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:28,350
I think docker was around a year old but

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,440
we were seeing a lot of benefits from it

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,930
and so we were able to get all these

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,600
individuals on board and start to build

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,700
out this system and within just a few

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,490
months we were proving value and

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:45,660
delivering working software of higher

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:48,300
quality much faster to customers we also

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,580
had a another product brand-new product

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,030
that was trying to build features into

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,830
their system and they came over they saw

00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,920
kind of what we were trying to do and

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:02,150
they came over to try to to jump on

00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,530
board with this and some of what we

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,710
allowed for them was we facilitated

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:10,380
their ability to get work done and they

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:13,170
used our cluster of mezzos to build

00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,140
their own product on top of and so we

00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:23,190
slowly started to add more nodes to it

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:28,950
as that business grew so a vision should

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:31,020
be bold it should be inspiring so you

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,720
need to set something that people want

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,260
to follow or want to work towards ours

00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:40,200
was we had a we had one of the largest

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:44,070
Jenkins installations is installations

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:47,460
in the world and it was constant the

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,740
queue was just massive of jobs you know

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,530
like 30 40 jobs waiting in the queue to

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,779
run and so response time to developers

00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,459
was taking a really long time

00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:59,459
and we needed to try to solve that

00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:03,600
problem and we wanted to do it with with

00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:05,600
a lot of newer tools that were really

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,630
the only thing we had available to us

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,510
this was an area that I decided to focus

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,810
on the smaller piece and not go to try

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,370
to automate all of the VMware stuff

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,399
because that group was not interested

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:24,260
and being a part of that so we had to

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,260
use the tools that were available to us

00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,660
and it should also be actionable so if

00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:32,610
people can't take action on a vision

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,089
then it's probably not going to be very

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:39,420
useful part of this the this vision that

00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:41,490
we had at cerner allowed people who

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,279
weren't even part of the main vision to

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,050
take action so those that team from

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,380
another product area was able to come

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:53,459
over and work on on the shared vision

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:57,060
together and it should also be business

00:09:53,459 --> 00:10:00,570
focused so the reason that I was allowed

00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:03,060
to do any of this work not only because

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:07,230
I was doing almost all of it in my extra

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,690
time but it was also because our focus

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:13,050
was on delivering value to customers

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,760
faster at a higher quality and not on

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,740
playing around with me Zoe's docker

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,370
although that may have been the real

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:24,240
reason but that was a that should not be

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:28,589
how you pitched this to leadership just

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,390
saying so if you are a leader then you

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:32,520
should spend time creating this vision

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:37,670
and this is even if you're an informal

00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:44,010
leader these will take a lot of time and

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:46,529
you need to take time away from work to

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,890
actually develop this you can't just try

00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:51,420
to do it as you're going so at the I

00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,649
worked at another company called the

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,459
National Association of Insurance

00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:58,380
Commissioners in the United States

00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:00,329
Insurance is a state based system so we

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,360
have no federal government organization

00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:04,890
that helps manage insurance so we're

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
kind of the cat herders for all the

00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,190
Insurance Commissioners we started like

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,340
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:16,440
years ago to help plan events for them

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:20,940
and create model law but we also now do

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:24,030
all their IT work so while we were at

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:27,000
the ni C NAIC we needed to do a full

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,910
DevOps transformation we had a lot of

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,880
old processes the culture was pretty

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:36,300
good but there was some missing areas

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,990
that we wanted to enhance and we spent a

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,790
week traveling to different companies

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,680
and then another week kind of

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:47,280
establishing this vision at least a

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,500
first draft of it and we'll discuss kind

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,290
of how we rolled that out to the rest of

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,760
the organization over time I also want

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,970
to mention this so I'd mentioned a

00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,600
generative culture earlier that that is

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,880
a much easier area to be a non formal

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,180
leader of these types of things and this

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,570
comes from want Ron sorry dr. Ron

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:12,500
westrom and this is the often referred

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:15,870
to as the Western culture typology and

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,380
there's three different areas of how

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:22,550
organizations process information

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:27,060
pathological bureaucratic and generative

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:30,660
it's generally known that pathological

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,480
and generative organizations are the

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,460
most successful if you think of

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,270
pathological you might think of Apple

00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:42,270
during the Steve Jobs days that was

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:43,830
likely a very pathological company or

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,740
that's the way they processed

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:50,190
information based off the stories and a

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,350
gender of generative culture you might

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,450
think of a Google where you don't I'd

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,890
necessarily identify an individual

00:12:54,450 --> 00:13:02,780
authoritarian leader or someone who's

00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:06,050
focused on having their vision fulfilled

00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,940
and bureaucratic is the least effective

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,900
but probably the most common there's at

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,900
least the most common I see

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,230
so a bad vision will lead to bad

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,779
outcomes so it's not it's it's not good

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:28,269
to just create a vision you need to

00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:31,899
create a a vision that is effect is

00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:34,019
going to be effective a bad vision will

00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:37,930
be biased for failure

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:39,069
no vision is is also going to be a bad

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,589
vision so if you try to do a

00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:44,649
transformation and you don't tell anyone

00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:46,149
where you want to go and end up then

00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,029
likely they will continue to do the same

00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:52,120
thing that they are doing today

00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:54,430
organizations are heavily biased towards

00:13:52,120 --> 00:14:00,610
the mean and they will constantly revert

00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:03,970
to the mean also an IT focused vision is

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:08,350
not good it will not be successful

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:11,230
it is IT type pieces will change a lot

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:14,560
and these types of transformations will

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,079
take several years so if your goal is IT

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,550
oriented then that will be less

00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:23,800
successful than if its business focused

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,980
if there's a lack of clarity so visions

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:30,459
don't need to be highly detailed they

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:33,819
need to clearly identify what you're

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:37,389
trying to head towards one that I like

00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:40,480
is JFK's space race you know get to the

00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,920
moon vision it was basically we're going

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,339
to get to the moon by the end of the

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,930
decade go do it

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,290
there wasn't a lot of detail to how it

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:54,850
was gonna be done certainly JFK was no

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:57,519
rocket scientist or anything and he made

00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:00,519
sure though that people could take

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,040
action provided the infrastructure for

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:11,319
provided the funding provided the

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:11,889
motivation so we also can't do this

00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:14,319
alone

00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:18,790
so we need to find others who will help

00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:21,959
us and I like this quote it is not about

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,959
whether you call yourself

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,490
maybe it's fine it is not about that

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,550
apparently the microphone does not like

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,840
this quote

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,210
it is not about whether you call

00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,280
yourself a leader or not it is about

00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:39,430
what you have to show to people as a

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:47,110
leader leadership is contagious

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:49,360
you carry it and share it and this is

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:54,040
really about everyone as a leader and

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:56,380
everyone can show leadership and one

00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:04,450
leader is not going to transform a

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:06,970
company generally I take the the the the

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,370
perspective that I should use anyone who

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,410
is willing to help there won't be a lot

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,800
of people generally we're willing to put

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,780
themselves out there and help the cause

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,670
but if someone comes up to you you

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,430
should have some some work for them to

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:24,730
do and spend time figuring out what they

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:28,000
might be able to do there's I have a

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:30,700
strong bias towards informal leaders in

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,830
this area so that's kind of what I'm

00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,110
saying about anyone willing to help so

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,870
if there's a very junior software

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,960
engineer or sysadmin who wants to help

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:45,820
with this transformation empower them to

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:49,210
do that and to lead in their areas the I

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,940
find that formal leadership is generally

00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,280
has some sort of a bias in it with with

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,980
people that are leading or following

00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:00,310
that there's some authoritarianism there

00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:02,530
there's some negative aspect of you know

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,589
this person is in a leadership position

00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,569
a formal leadership role and so that's

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:10,089
why they get to do these things so I

00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:12,400
often in these situations try to empower

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,920
people who are not in formal leadership

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:22,959
roles that also help serve the per the

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:24,730
point of anyone can be a leader so you

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,970
really need to nurture this team and

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,160
this team can be made up of all informal

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,890
leaders and the person painting the

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,140
vision can be an informal leader and

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:38,380
this team will be the the reason that

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:40,090
you're successful the management team

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,600
that that exists today is not

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,720
necessarily going to be the

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,780
and everyone succeeds this team needs to

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,460
have outings together they need to be

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,549
they need to have a shared understanding

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:57,740
of where they're headed and they need to

00:17:52,549 --> 00:18:01,250
be able to act on that vision this team

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,890
will be the team that gets the negatives

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:07,940
and the positives earlier than any other

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:10,120
area of the organization so this team is

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,220
generally more biased for positive

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,860
feelings around the change because

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,590
they're obviously invested in it

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,890
however this team will know when things

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:24,470
are not going well and learning from

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:30,169
them and watching them will be really

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:32,030
valuable so at the NAIC we use this

00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:34,220
model as well and we had a lot of people

00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,860
who were informal leaders in their areas

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:41,140
and they were kind of our evangelists

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:43,880
for this change and they were able to

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,610
kind of help us understand where the

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,490
messaging was going wrong how we could

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,870
change that messaging and most of them

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,820
took that empowerment that we were

00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,740
giving them already and started to

00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,140
develop classes for some of their areas

00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,080
that that the people that you know say

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,900
in database or networking wouldn't feel

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,250
left out and we're ready for the change

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:09,020
that was coming because we were doing

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:11,539
cloud and DevOps and CI CD stuff just

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:14,960
about everything at once which was a

00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:17,750
little probably too much but it was very

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,850
effective having so many different

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,539
people leading in their own areas and

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,539
effecting change

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,330
and you should also publicly praise

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,910
these team members to help give them

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:38,980
more encouragement and to show other

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:42,110
people that these informal leaders are

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:46,010
what they could do as well we want to

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:58,040
have the evangelist group promote and

00:19:46,010 --> 00:20:01,120
produce more evangelists over time you

00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:05,990
also want to create shared experiences

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,930
so I like this quote for this words are

00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:11,180
symbols for shared memories if I use a

00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:13,490
word then you should have some

00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:17,020
experience of what the word stands for

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:20,720
if not the word means nothing to you so

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:23,360
this generally means that if that we all

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,670
have some experience with any word we've

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:30,730
heard it before we've had it heard we've

00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:34,130
heard it in some context depending on

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,410
where you've heard the word so I've over

00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,880
my lifespan I've found out that some of

00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,280
the words I thought I knew the meaning

00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,650
to and never looked up I was inaccurate

00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,440
as to what the meaning was because for

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,470
some reason in my area of where I grew

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,220
up that meaning had changed to some

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:54,260
extent and so we all have these

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,720
different experiences with words some of

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,120
them have really negative connotations

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,580
some have positive and a lot of these

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:11,050
are there are personal perspectives on

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:15,950
words so there are two levels of X

00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:17,750
building shared experiences and the

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,350
first is the leadership layer so this

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,570
isn't formal leadership but this is that

00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:29,240
leadership team who is painting the

00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:30,980
vision and I break up organization the

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,260
rest of the organization into a separate

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:37,700
area because I think that they require

00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:40,640
different modes of acting on this so

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,330
leadership is going to be a smaller team

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,480
there

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:47,180
going to be focused on creating that

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,550
vision making sure that vision is

00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,670
actionable whether that's finding other

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:55,220
people on other teams to help out which

00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:57,080
which we had to do and in the the Cerner

00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,720
instance where we had to get people that

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:03,740
were on teams that didn't really care to

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:08,360
help facilitate other teams who did want

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:12,650
to do this kind of work and they're both

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:18,560
equally important so leadership teams

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:21,320
need landmarks they need a something to

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,890
look back on so that they all have the

00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,780
same understanding of the language who

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,550
here thinks that they have a different

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:32,990
definition of DevOps than me

00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:35,060
all right there we go proof so this is

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,150
certainly DevOps as one of the first

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,730
words agile like all of these words are

00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,350
just horrible words because they mean

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,840
nothing

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:48,740
to an organization or a group of people

00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,420
but they mean a lot to individuals and

00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,160
for someone who goes around and talks

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,650
about a lot of DevOps stuff and runs a

00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,990
DevOps conference if they do mean quite

00:22:54,650 --> 00:23:00,380
a lot to me but they probably mean a lot

00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:04,310
less to other people I had someone at a

00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:08,150
company whose name I won't mention said

00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:13,490
I finally understand agile it's just

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:14,870
waterfall in shorter time periods yeah I

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:20,350
couldn't laugh because I was working

00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:23,690
there and I I left very quickly after

00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:28,840
yeah yeah pretty much that's uh that was

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:32,360
this person's interpretation so it was

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,920
really disappointing when that kind of

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:40,580
when that state kind of statement is

00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:42,890
made and that it makes it clear that so

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:48,320
so when those those revelations happen a

00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:50,450
lot and they are sometimes encouraging

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,910
and discouraging at the same time where

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,860
you will have someone in a meeting say

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,280
oh I finally understand what you're

00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,700
saying

00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,800
and then you say okay well tell me what

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,830
do you understand and then they tell you

00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,510
and you realize that's you you've just

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,660
had a revelation which means that I'm

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:11,450
gonna have to try even harder now to

00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:13,790
explain what I'm trying to get across so

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,480
it does take a lot of time because we're

00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:21,890
we're destroying this history of

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,660
knowledge around these words but

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,360
building that shared information model

00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,820
is critical to moving forward because if

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:32,180
you're all talking about these words in

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,680
a different way than anyone else in the

00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,770
organization is not going to have any

00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:44,270
clue as to what those words mean to the

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:46,100
organization these shared experience

00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:49,400
points are also referenced reference

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:53,840
points to look back on for example when

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:58,460
I was at the NAIC and another company

00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,680
called dia DST which is a company that

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,320
has financial data from all around the

00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,230
world but they have like 70% of all

00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,200
mutual fund data but you'd never heard

00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:12,500
of them their back-end for banks and

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:17,690
things but at both of those companies we

00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:20,660
went and toured Google and Amazon and a

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:24,140
bunch of startups with the leadership

00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,820
team and at DST I went with the Office

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,860
of the President and I was just a

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:31,400
manager who had just become a manager

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,950
from a DevOps engineer earlier that year

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,490
so I was essentially a nobody in the

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:40,010
company but I was able to get this this

00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,720
thing scheduled and and beyond the trip

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,890
with them with the Office of the

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:50,030
President and that was a really good

00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:51,650
trip and and we were all able to to

00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,200
start understanding where we wanted to

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,760
go and where we you know what that

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,520
vision would be that we would paint for

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:02,030
the organization and we were able to

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:06,590
begin understanding the terms and the

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:09,049
CEO was beginning to understand what our

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,880
real data center looked like

00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:13,450
and what real utilization look like

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:17,000
inside of that datacenter we were a

00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:19,490
financial processing type system so

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,370
almost all of our compute was sitting

00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:25,580
idle all year for that end of your

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:27,799
processing that spiked incredibly high

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:32,570
so most of the time it's just sitting

00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:35,080
there unused and I think that was a bit

00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:37,940
of a revelation to him on that trip that

00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,179
that trip also provide a lot of provided

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:45,409
a lot of inspiration it showed us how

00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:50,240
things could be it showed us how strong

00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:55,399
teams work and get work done and it

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:59,240
provided motivation moving forward one

00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:03,200
thing we did not do it at DST but we did

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,210
at the NAIC is we repeated these so not

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,940
we didn't do them just once and that was

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:10,970
it we did them every few months where we

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:14,539
would do some sort of activity to

00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:17,950
provide kind of another touch point and

00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:17,950
another reference point to look back on

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:26,750
so at one organization we did kind of

00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:28,340
leave everyone behind and so I learned

00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,159
from that and didn't do that the next

00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:34,850
time you can't just go on your little

00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,200
leadership trip or go and do a fun team

00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,120
building exercise with your leadership

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,860
team and then ignore the the fact that

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:44,539
the rest of the organization exists so

00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,870
they also need a shared information

00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:51,049
model so one of these organizations I

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:54,260
was at we went on our leadership trip we

00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:56,870
came back we kind of set the vision of

00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,690
what we were going to do that message

00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:01,460
got delivered to the management team you

00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,390
know hundreds of managers across the

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:07,309
organization they interpreted it however

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:10,159
they wanted which was mostly in line

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:12,230
with what they were already doing and so

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,220
we got basically the same thing we had

00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:18,139
before with a slight improvement which

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,639
was not the goal of what we wanted and

00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:22,830
ultimately that company has been

00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:26,159
acquired and not a great acquisition

00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:29,220
and so that was to some extent on us not

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,230
being able to spread that message and

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,120
and create a shared understanding across

00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,389
the company and also a shared

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,970
understanding of where the company was

00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:41,490
in this process of you know we're gonna

00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:45,110
have to get acquired because the

00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,110
business is not successful anymore

00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:52,350
so a shared experience with the

00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:54,840
organization is also to help motivate

00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:57,480
them not just create a shared language

00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,480
for everyone to use but it's also to

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,480
provide some motivation so at NAIC we

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,450
actually paid for I think 40 or 50

00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,360
people every year the organization was

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:13,710
in total 600 and the the technology

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:17,029
folks were about 250 and so we paid for

00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:19,850
40 or 50 people to go to AWS reinvent

00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:22,230
every year which was fairly expensive

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,210
but we thought it was worth it for them

00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:27,870
to go and experience this together and

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:32,340
to come back motivated and ready to try

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:35,220
new things to work differently and every

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:44,129
year sending a these groups to different

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:46,259
conferences it was really valuable so

00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:49,230
leaders should also be leading so the

00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:53,879
CTO went to all these conferences every

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:55,500
year with the team didn't just sit in an

00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:58,019
ivory tower or just go on leadership

00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,860
events but went and actually

00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:06,990
participated with the teams we also had

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:09,779
a hackathon type event where the CTO was

00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:12,049
heavily involved was a judge I was the

00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:15,750
chief architect there I was also a judge

00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:19,769
and we were there the whole time we

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:23,250
attended the I don't know what they call

00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:25,289
them maybe it was a CEO of there were

00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,769
sister companies and both CEOs were at

00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:30,450
the event and both CEO is presented and

00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:32,789
so there was a lot of involvement from

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:35,910
leadership and other organizations I've

00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:39,630
been to you get a lot of

00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:42,000
since from leaders people that are vice

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:45,750
presidents or presidents never show up

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,820
to events and that can be damaging but

00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,590
most importantly the person leading the

00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,390
vision should be involved in these

00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,390
events with the rest of the organization

00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:59,040
so I've already talked about attending

00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:03,840
conferences we've also read books

00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:06,270
together so I think earlier the DevOps

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,060
handbook was mentioned I'm sure the

00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:11,370
Phoenix project has been mentioned there

00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:14,160
are many books around this area that

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:16,350
it's really valuable for everyone in the

00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,050
group to read the same book and have the

00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:23,670
same reference points who here has read

00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:26,400
the Phoenix project only a few okay you

00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:28,140
guys know who Brent is but no one else

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,370
does so you should go read the Phoenix

00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,780
project you find a lot of times in

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,890
DevOps

00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:38,760
communities that a lot of people have

00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:42,060
read particular books and then you can

00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,710
kind of talk to people relating back to

00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,710
that book and what was said in the book

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,320
I mentioned that you can tour companies

00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,540
that you want to be like another way I

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,680
found is a great way to build shared

00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:01,770
experiences especially across disparate

00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:07,140
areas of the company so you know Dell is

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:12,510
everywhere but even RSA is in I think

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:15,570
four states and several countries around

00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:19,800
the world so we have people in India

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:22,650
Israel Australia UK I think there's some

00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,850
people in Germany actually I mean

00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,340
they're all over the place so it's

00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:29,760
really hard to stay connected and remain

00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,880
a team and one way to do this is slack

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,020
who here uses slack

00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,430
few people there's a bunch of other

00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:41,490
tools that are similar so there's a who

00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:44,850
here knows who XE is or what Etsy is not

00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:47,730
of whoo all right so John all spa was

00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,560
the CTO of Etsy and while he was there

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,500
they introduced a

00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:55,620
tool that they called mixer and that

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,230
tool use the active directory system to

00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,210
pair people up every two weeks or a

00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,430
month or something like that and it was

00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,830
fairly random so it just took people and

00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,410
paired them up and then they went and

00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,820
had a coffee or something

00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:11,340
so we've done that now at two

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,680
organizations and found a lot of value

00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:16,700
in it there's a tool called donut that

00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,990
integrates with slack and being able to

00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,870
first have slack where there's the

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:25,590
shared communication platform and second

00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:29,190
be able to make this I believe Etsy

00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:31,200
calls it assisted serendipity and having

00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,070
this assisted serendipity within the

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,050
organization

00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:38,820
to help create connections was really

00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:45,750
valuable and it helps to to horizontally

00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:48,120
spread the information between teams so

00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:52,050
the next step is that everyone needs to

00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,940
get a little bit more education what I

00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:57,240
find in a lot of organizations is that

00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:59,490
people are very busy with the regular

00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,620
work of keeping a system up and keeping

00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:05,610
features rolling out and there's not a

00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:09,090
lot of time to learn new things or to

00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:11,300
practice those new things and so we need

00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:15,240
to give people the opportunity for this

00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:18,540
Benjamin Franklin said an investment in

00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:21,050
knowledge pays the best interest and

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:26,419
many organizations do not prioritize

00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:28,919
education it's usually an afterthought

00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:31,140
and I think you really need to learn

00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:33,540
something new to build something new if

00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:35,429
you use the same people with the same

00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:39,570
knowledge to try to create a new system

00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:41,429
or to dramatically change a system it's

00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:45,060
unlikely that you will get anything

00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:47,580
different and when I say system here I'm

00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:52,409
using it in a context so this is another

00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:55,320
word system is a very vague word so dr.

00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:58,470
Richard cook wrote a a paper about how

00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,380
complex systems fail I suggest you read

00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:03,300
it it's a very interesting paper and if

00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,980
I didn't tell you what I'm about to tell

00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,980
you'd probably think it was a technology

00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:11,100
system but in fact he's describing the

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,800
human system of nurses and doctors at a

00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,990
hospital and he goes through all these

00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,290
different failure modes of the system

00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:22,170
and how those things would would reveal

00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:23,220
themselves in the system so here what

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,890
I'm talking about system I'm talking

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,530
about system generally and if you're

00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:30,090
going to build a new system and you

00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,290
haven't learned anything that's

00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,930
different than that system you'll

00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:36,000
probably build the same system there's

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,970
something similar around Conway's law

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,550
and if you have a communication

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,100
structure and/or your organization then

00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:48,170
you will likely build a tool that looks

00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,170
just like that communication system so

00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:58,740
knowledge changes outcomes with that new

00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:02,310
knowledge you will get different

00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,770
outcomes just by providing education to

00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,630
people you will get outcomes that are

00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:10,530
different than if you hadn't provided

00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:13,230
that information this is a an aspect of

00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:17,700
how complex systems failure fail which

00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:20,760
is you introducing a change will have

00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,850
unexpected consequences on the system so

00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,250
you can't predict what will happen you

00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:28,470
just try it you need to try to give the

00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,780
system the best information possible and

00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:36,720
then allow the system to make make

00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:40,140
decisions you need to make education a

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,550
priority building this into goals is a

00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,460
really good thing or things that are

00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:46,320
measured by the organization most

00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,920
organizations will say yeah we really

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,810
value education they may make it

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,820
available but they don't make it a

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,550
priority so they'll say hey we have this

00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,470
training site you should go do this you

00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:02,370
have no time to do it so do it on your

00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:04,950
own time and you know we will monitor

00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:07,110
your progress on it but you won't

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:09,900
actually get paid anymore if you

00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:11,460
complete it or don't complete it you

00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,550
will still get your bonus if you don't

00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,810
complete it whatever the case is it is

00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:21,220
not aligned with the priorities of the

00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:22,780
individual or the organization so this

00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:27,370
is something that usually you need

00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:31,930
formal leadership to act on I do it with

00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:34,840
my direct reports to set clear education

00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:37,840
goals that say these you know you need

00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,730
to do these things and usually so I'm

00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,370
working with a lot of architects

00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:45,850
generally and I expect architects not

00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:48,300
only to learn on their own but also to

00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:51,430
teach and I think that's part of

00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:54,160
Education part of what I've learned so

00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:56,530
much is by trying to present to others I

00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:01,060
spend hundreds of hours researching

00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:05,170
things just to be able to present on on

00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:08,160
different pieces so I expect architects

00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:12,040
to present information to other people

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:16,750
and that makes it a a clear deliverable

00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:19,540
and a clear goal in the organization it

00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,280
also needs to be monitored so I'd said

00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:26,020
that you know some some of these tools

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,460
that are available for for like I think

00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,080
code Academy there's a few other ones

00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,720
they actually provide dashboards for

00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,910
organizations and you need to monitor

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,310
that people are learning and that

00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:38,790
they're taking action and you need to

00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,790
reward that

00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:47,590
so everyone also learns differently even

00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,540
so the NAIC had a great culture when I

00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:53,170
got there and they had a great

00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:55,930
leadership team and we still went around

00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:59,100
and around about how you know what is

00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:02,590
the best thing to provide to people

00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,330
there's online training so you know we

00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,550
could just do all online training and I

00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:11,230
and I'm biased towards not having

00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:12,990
in-person training but and so I was

00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:15,970
maybe part of the problem of this too

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:18,760
but I was like I just provide online

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,680
training and I was told you know that's

00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,480
probably not the right way to do this we

00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,610
need to provide all different kinds of

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,040
forms of training so some people do

00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:29,770
learn better with in-person classes also

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,250
in-person classes dedicate someone to

00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,280
the

00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,500
training during the day it's usually

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,330
set-aside that you know this day or

00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:43,030
these few days are dedicated to this

00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:44,980
training I also use newsletters these

00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,650
are not read as often but I try to

00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:50,500
accumulate in newsletters and send them

00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,570
out every couple of weeks to say this is

00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,610
kind of what we want to focus on and

00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,840
this is what you should be learning if

00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,290
you want to be leading in this

00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:02,260
organization moving forward and then

00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:04,090
attending conferences that's a a great

00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,640
learning opportunity and a great way to

00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:10,600
meet people and learn how their they're

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,640
doing things in other organizations and

00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,910
we also do hackathons which is a great

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,670
way of learning very quickly and putting

00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:23,620
that into practice and we just had one a

00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:26,380
few weeks ago at RSA and a few of those

00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,240
items are things that we will be putting

00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,520
into production systems

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:38,950
there were great features that came out

00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:40,810
of it you also need to get feedback so

00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:44,550
one issue that I think a lot of people

00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:48,070
run into is that and one issue that I've

00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:51,190
you know run into and my own practice of

00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:52,810
this is not getting feedback not getting

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,480
feedback early enough not getting the

00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:58,080
right feedback and assuming that you're

00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,080
doing the right thing

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:06,390
so I like Daniel Kahneman's quote on

00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:09,490
this true intuitive expertise is learned

00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:13,840
from prolonged experience with good

00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:16,810
feedback on mistakes so I like his use

00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,830
of intuitive expertise so that's what

00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,230
we're trying to build into the

00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:23,680
organization is an intuitive expertise

00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,780
of how the culture should act and the

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:31,810
behaviors that are expected in that

00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:33,490
culture so you need to measure what

00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:40,780
matters who here has read the book

00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:42,100
accelerate by dr. Nicole Forsman you

00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,450
guys will have to reference a whole

00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,990
bunch of German books that I've also

00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,990
never read

00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:56,059
so dr. Niccole foreign who's heard of

00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:59,809
the DevOps weight annual state of DevOps

00:41:56,059 --> 00:42:01,280
report there's a big DevOps survey that

00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:04,010
goes out every year

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,420
puppet used to do it and now it's Google

00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:11,780
because Google bought the company that

00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,520
dr. Forbes grande started anyway so so

00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,230
puppet used to do it now Google does it

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,800
I think it's open right now so go fill

00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:21,470
it out it's state of DevOps survey or

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:26,859
something like that just Google that she

00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:31,010
identifies four key metrics to measure

00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:34,630
and this is to measure our overall

00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:37,089
success so even though we're focused on

00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:39,140
mostly a cultural transformation

00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:42,730
although this transformation can take

00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:46,670
place and see icd systems are monitoring

00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:51,829
we want to to be able to measure the the

00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:53,869
whole system and its output and the

00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:56,210
accelerate book and the state of DevOps

00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:59,180
report is very focused on business value

00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:01,609
and measuring business value so they

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:04,700
they also correlate this to stock price

00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:07,730
and they find that that these four

00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:10,250
metrics delivery lead time which is your

00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:13,280
time from the commit to assess

00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:14,960
successfully running a production they

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,319
decided not to do anything before the

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,520
commit into the source code system

00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:22,400
because it's so variable every

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,960
organization is very different in what

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,990
they consider the start of an idea

00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:35,530
the second is deployment frequency that

00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:38,990
is a proxy for batch size and that is

00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,640
the deployment is to production or an

00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:45,680
app store or something that is going to

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,390
a customer and the the third one is mean

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,030
time to recovery which is a fairly

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:52,339
common one and then the fourth is

00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:55,940
changed failure rate and the change

00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:58,020
failure rate is a proxy for quality so

00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:00,750
they couldn't identify any other quality

00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:04,260
Chirk that was reasonable everyone

00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:07,290
probably agrees that that percentage

00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:11,370
based metrics on testing are not usually

00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:13,170
very helpful and they're easily gamed so

00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:14,850
those were the four metrics and those

00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:17,850
are the four metrics that that showed

00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:20,970
those organizations are producing a lot

00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:22,410
of business value so starting to collect

00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:25,170
those metrics before one of these

00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,940
changes and throughout the change and

00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,490
after you think you're done is really

00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:33,510
helpful to getting solid information

00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:36,510
back you know highly quantifiable

00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:38,490
information so that you can see are you

00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:41,160
negatively affecting the overall system

00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:44,310
although you may be doing what you want

00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:46,290
to do it may not be creating a system

00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:48,170
that is more productive or more

00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:51,480
efficient for your customers and

00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:57,960
ultimately that's what pays you so you

00:44:51,480 --> 00:45:00,480
should probably optimize for that so the

00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,970
Western culture survey which I mentioned

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,710
earlier is another way we measure so

00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:07,590
I've done that at several organizations

00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:11,400
I usually do that for my own team

00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:16,470
especially in high change environments

00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:18,780
if we if we're in a a very fast-paced

00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:22,940
transformation I will even do this every

00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:26,460
week it's like five or six questions I

00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:30,630
think it's six questions and it is a

00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:34,470
Likert scale so it's just from strongly

00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:35,850
disagree to strongly agree and people

00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,910
just go through and take it really fast

00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:41,220
and that gives me very quick feedback to

00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:43,320
are things that we are doing are those

00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:47,040
negatively impacting the culture of the

00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:49,410
team or are they positively impacting

00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:55,260
the culture of the team and and and as

00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:58,860
the if there's a series of bad results

00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:05,790
coming out of it what do I need to do to

00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:09,660
change this environment and you can also

00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:12,130
do user surveys so the users of a

00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,050
transformation are employees

00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:16,600
and you should survey them to see if

00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:19,360
they like what is happening you also

00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:23,050
often get a high attrition rates in

00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,730
these types of transformations and so

00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:29,640
you want to be able to identify some of

00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:33,820
this you can also do one-on-one feedback

00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:36,670
at the NAIC the CTO met with everyone

00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:40,420
one on one and then met with small

00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:43,440
groups of people every quarter and so it

00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:47,110
was constantly getting a lot of feedback

00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,420
very direct rather than trying to do it

00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:53,110
and some sort of a survey or bubbling up

00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:55,570
through management chains and there's a

00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,940
company called culture amp who helped us

00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,830
at the NAIC and they were really

00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:02,890
valuable and being able to bring this

00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:06,450
information back aggregate it up and

00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,450
present it back out to the organization

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:16,450
and here are some references I'll

00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:19,360
publish this on my website shortly after

00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:23,620
this so you can go click on them if you

00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:25,270
have a Google pixel then you can

00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:27,100
probably just click on them in the photo

00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:29,890
which is awesome

00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:32,410
if you if you need to see that then I'm

00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:38,680
happy to show you because Google stuff

00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:43,210
is awesome and then there's some contact

00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:46,110
information that's my my website and

00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,110
then our si.com

00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:55,960
and that is where the presentation will

00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:59,550
be posted on Dan Barker codes probably

00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:04,600
within the next day thank you very much

00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:07,760
[Applause]

00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:10,220
thank you we will also collect the

00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,730
slides and publish them and II it was DC

00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:17,450
archive later so how about questions

00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:24,200
before we leaving for lunch everyone

00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:26,020
still awake they may have questions I

00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,980
don't know if lunch is ready yet

00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:33,580
yeah I've seen it on Twitter it is ready

00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:36,380
anybody can come up and ask me later

00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:40,160
yeah I have to confess I have no

00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:42,080
questions I thank you for the talk and

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,120
