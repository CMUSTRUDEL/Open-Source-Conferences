Title: OSDC 2019: Introducing Kudo – Kubernetes Operators the easy way by Matt Javis
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Kubernetes Operators are the next phase of the journey towards automating complex applications in containers. Many Operators that exist today handle initial deployment, but they don’t provide automation for tasks like binary upgrades, configuration updates, and failure recovery. Implementing a production-grade controller for a complex workload typically requires thousands of lines of code and many months of development. As a result, the quality of operators that are available today varies. In DC/OS, the DC/OS commons SDK enables anyone to build service automation for DC/OS using just a declarative spec in most cases. The Kudo project can now leverage this set of automation expertise to enable automated creation of operators for Kubernetes. In this talk I’ll introduce the Kudo project, talk through the conceptual similarities between frameworks and operators, and demo the creation of a Kubernetes operator using Kudo.
