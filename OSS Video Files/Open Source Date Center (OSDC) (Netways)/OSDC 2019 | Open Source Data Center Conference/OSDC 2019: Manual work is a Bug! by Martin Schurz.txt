Title: OSDC 2019: Manual work is a Bug! by Martin Schurz
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	We are all drowning in work and automation seems to be our only salvation. But sometimes our best intentions lead to horribly broken systems that need manual intervention or are outright unmaintainable. How does that happen and what can we do to prevent that? In this talk I want to show some mental models and frameworks to create good automation systems that support our teams and reduce the need for manual actions.
