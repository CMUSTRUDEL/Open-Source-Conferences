Title: OSDC 2019: Mgmt Config: The future of your autonomous datacenter by James Shubin
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Mgmt is a real-time automation tool that is fast and safe. One goal of the tool is to allow users to model and manage infrastructure that was previously very difficult or impossible to do so previously.
To showcase this future, we’ll show some exciting real-time demos that include scheduling, distributed state machines, and remote execution. As we get closer to a 0.1 release that we’ll recommend as “production ready”, we’ll look at the last remaining features that we’re aiming to land by then.
