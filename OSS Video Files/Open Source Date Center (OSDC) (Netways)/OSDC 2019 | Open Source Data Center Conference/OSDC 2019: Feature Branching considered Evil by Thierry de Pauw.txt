Title: OSDC 2019: Feature Branching considered Evil by Thierry de Pauw
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	With DVCSs, branch creation became very easy, but it comes at a certain cost. Long living branches break the flow of the software delivery process, impacting stability and throughput. The session explores why teams are using feature branches, what problems are introduced by using them and what techniques exist to avoid them altogether. It explores exactly what’s evil about feature branches, which is not necessarily the problems they introduce – but rather, the real reasons why teams are using them. After the session, you’ll understand a different branching strategy and how it relates to CI/CD.
