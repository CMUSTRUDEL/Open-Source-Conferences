Title: OSDC 2019: Mgmt Config: Advanced demos and Internals for hackers by James Shubin
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	Mgmt is a real-time automation tool that is fast and safe. One goal of the tool is to allow users to model and manage infrastructure that was previously very difficult or impossible to do so previously.
This presentation will briefly introduce the tool and spend most of the time presenting and demoing some of the advanced and/or lesser-known features in the project. We’re certain the audience will have experienced many infrastructure tool problems before, and we hope to convince you via many live demos that our novel approaches are efficient and elegant.We’ll also dive into some of the internals of the project for new contributors who want to peer into the core code and become an advanced user of the project. Finally we’ll talk about some of the future designs we’re planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project. This talk will assume some prior knowledge from any earlier mgmt talk. Make sure to come to the first talk or workshop if you plan on attending this session.
