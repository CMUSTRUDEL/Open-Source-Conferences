Title: OSDC 2019: Running backups with Ceph-to-Ceph by Michael Raabe
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	This presentation highlights several different methods for backups inside of Ceph (clusters). We often receive requests for both local and remote backups. So we would like to introduce backup methods using external tools as well as some using Ceph’s own ‘rbd export’ or ‘rbd-mirror’ approaches. Learn about the pros and cons of each approach, be warned of possible pitfalls both of native use or OpenStack-based approaches.
