Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	So, youâ€™ve migrated your application to Reactive Microservices to get the last ounce of performance from your servers. Still want more? Perhaps you forgot about the logs: logs can be one of the few roadblocks on the road to ultimate performance. At Exoscale, we faced the same challenges as everyone: the application produces logs, and they need to be stored in our log storage â€“ Elasticsearch, with the minimum of fuss and the fastest way possible. In this talk, Iâ€™ll show you some insider tips and tricks taken from our experience put you on the track toward fast(er) log management. Without revealing too much, it involves async loggers, JSON, Kafka and Logstash.

OPNsense is an open source and easy-to-use FreeBSD based firewall and routing platform. 2018 â€“ three years after OPNsense started as a fork of pfSenseÂ® and m0n0wall â€“ OPNsense brings the rich feature set of commercial offerings with the benefits of open and verifiable sources. A strong focus on security and code quality drives the development of the project. The modern and intuitive web interface makes configuring firewall rules funny ðŸ™‚
In this talk, Thomas will outline OPNsenseâ€™s FreeBSD-based architecture and how you can take advantage of additional features using OPNsense plugins. He will also show how to initially setup an OPNsense firewall, and how you use datacenter-features like High Availability & Hardware Failover or Dual Uplinks.
Open (source) makes sense â€“ also for your firewall ðŸ™‚
