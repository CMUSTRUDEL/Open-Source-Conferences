00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:18,510
hi hello I'm German I would like to talk

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,029
to you about Vox Populi which is the

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:25,260
awesome puppet community quick Paul who

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,400
a few has heard about Vox Populi so many

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,000
people that's awesome

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,189
so I'm a DevOps engineer I do a lot of

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,950
puppet stuff since around 2012 and I'm

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,260
active in the community since around

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:40,320
2015 and I'm very busy merging pull

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,420
requests and review code and yell at

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,390
people for breaking things mostly

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,530
yelling at myself because will suffer

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,690
breaks often so what is works for Puli

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,840
we are in very big community we have a

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,829
bunch of puppet modules and we try to

00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,379
unite very many authors of - it's to

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,690
write code together at the moment we

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,330
have over 120 people with merch access

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,630
to our repositories and the number grows

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,320
quite fast and we are a very independent

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,420
group compared to puppet most of our

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,560
peoples are new to get and new to tests

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,610
but can write pretty good puppet code so

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,439
everybody in our community mostly

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,600
teaches people how to use git and not

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,299
how to write good puppet code which

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,600
sounds a bit confusing why did we start

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,950
this we noticed that writing code on

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,290
your own is pretty hard and sucks

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,119
because sometimes you would like to have

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,030
a vacation or go out with some friends

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,890
and that's annoying when you have 200

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,299
people that would like feature requests

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,490
so we need to automate ourself to make

00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:50,399
development in a group more efficient

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:57,329
and faster for this we have developed

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:59,909
some tools for example mod using this is

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,680
a good reporter takes template and a

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,909
list of all repositories that we have

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,030
and all modules and we iterate about

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,640
those modules to apply as many templates

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,840
as we can for example for Travis

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,860
configuration which we use for

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,590
continuous integration

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,680
it runs a bunch of aspect puppet and

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,350
lintel stuff so we can ensure that our

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,850
code is streamlined and we have a

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:29,310
consistent style yeah besides this we

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,320
also use pika for acceptance tests this

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,900
basically spins up a virtual machine or

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,390
a docker instance executes puppet in it

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,480
and at the end we check if the system

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,670
looks as it should look in spec or was a

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,070
kitchen for example you can run become

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,460
ugly before you submit a pull request or

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,380
you can just take the yolo approach and

00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,770
submit a pull request and Travis will

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:56,520
hopefully execute the tests on your

00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:59,280
behalf which works most of the time we

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,410
also have some other tuning available to

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,510
check how many or poor requests we have

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,070
for many open issues where we need to

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,000
respond where we are waiting for

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:12,540
feedback and some other stuff to

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,720
identify people too a lot of work also

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,110
governance is pretty pretty important as

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:23,010
the crew grows and gets bigger and

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:25,890
bigger and we copied some stuff from the

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,410
OpenStack foundation for example the

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,410
project management committee this is a

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,510
smaller group with inbox property of 5

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,940
people and we enforce our code of

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,430
conduct we speak at conferences as you

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,720
can see at the moment and we are trying

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,910
to get into the software freedom

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,130
Conservancy so we are legal embassy and

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,400
people can sponsor us and send us money

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:50,700
and stuff yeah we also have contributors

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,800
many many of them they mostly review all

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,630
the pull requests that we have and tell

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,940
people why all the Ruby version sucks

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,650
and you should not use them so quick

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,690
summary we have awesome tooling

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,610
available which you can check out later

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,980
we have many many people all of them are

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,980
great you can talk to them we all nice

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,780
yeah if you need some help with puppet

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,239
just let us know and we are very open if

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,070
you need some help or have an old module

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,930
you can migrate it to us so if you know

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,229
some stuff about Ruby Python whatever

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,300
you can help us out because we are

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,600
always looking for a new maintainer and

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,640

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,780
like to get in touch with us just send
