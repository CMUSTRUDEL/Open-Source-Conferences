Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	The rise of IoT and smart infrastructure has led to the generation of massive amounts of complex data. In this session, we will talk about time-series data, the challenges of working with time series data, ingestion of this data using data from NYC cabs and running real time queries to gather insights. By the end of the session, we will have an understanding of what time-series data is, how to build streaming data pipelines for massive time series data using Flink, Kafka and CrateDB, and visualising all this data with the help of a dashboard.
