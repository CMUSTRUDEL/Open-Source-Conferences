Title: OSDC 2019: Running MySQL & MariaDB Server securely in 2019 by Colin Charles
Publication date: 2019-05-21
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	The Internet is filled with outdated information on how you in practice run MySQL and MariaDB Server securely in 2019. Naturally, this is not the fault of the Internet but the fact that the security models with modern MySQL 8 and MariaDB Server 10.3/10.4 have changed, giving you newer options.
More interestingly is also the fact that you tend to run in Wide Area Network (WAN) environments, and replication can happen across cloud-based environments. This is where we will also within this talk setup quickly a fully running 3-node Galera Cluster with MariaDB Server 10.4, in a secure fashion, showing you why you do not have to “run with SELinux turned off” or other poor practices (e.g. turning off the firewall).
Topics covered but not limited to: TLS/SSL for connections, replication, external authentication, encryption, and regular running and configuration of your MySQL and MariaDB Servers (both of which take on many different options).
