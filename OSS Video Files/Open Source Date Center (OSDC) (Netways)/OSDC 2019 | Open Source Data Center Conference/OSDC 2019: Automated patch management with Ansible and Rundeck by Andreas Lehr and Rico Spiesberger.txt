Title: OSDC 2019: Automated patch management with Ansible and Rundeck by Andreas Lehr and Rico Spiesberger
Publication date: 2019-05-23
Playlist: OSDC 2019 | Open Source Data Center Conference
Description: 
	In our On Premise hosting environment we still run a lot of applications on traditional stacks without using containers. In order to run them in a secured way we created a mature patch automation. Thanks to ansible, rundeck, icinga and a bunch of other opensource tools we are able to update and reboot most of our systems without our customers noticing. We do that throughout the day on a regular base using rundeck, or even on short notice if another “heartbleed” occurs.
