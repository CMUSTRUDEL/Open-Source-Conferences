Title: OSDC 2019: Evolution of a Microservice-Infrastructure by Jan Martens
Publication date: 2019-05-21

Description: 
	This talk is about our journey from Nginx & Docker Swarm to Traefik & Nomad. With the increase of load & traffic on our container-environment over the time, we experienced some issues that were unnoticed when built the environment. Due to the way we dynamically configured Nginx with Consul-Template we started to experience a lot of dropped keepalive connections and connection resets. Also the traffic wasnâ€™t distributed evenly throughout our container-infrastructure which led to single instances receiving most of the load. This is why made the decision to change to a reverse-proxy that can get dynamically configured. We were aware of the shortcommings of Docker Swarm (standalone) and seeked for a tool that would allow us to distribute containers more evenly without totally reconstructing everything and provide us with self healing capabilities. Performing these changes under the hood, transparent for our developers, was one of our key objectives.
