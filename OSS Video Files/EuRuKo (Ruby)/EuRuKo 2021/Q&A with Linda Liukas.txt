hello and welcome back

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,559
hello linda nice to see you

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,599
too thank you connecting to ourselves

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,719
and to nature again we have a bit of

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,840
problem here

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,800
our audience is so astonished by your

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,560
speak that we don't have any questions

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,160
but i would like to

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,519
read some comments out loud and

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,920
for you our dear audience

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,640
i know that linda is has been really

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,079
extreme

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,120
active in streams chat and what

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,320
you don't see is what i do see

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,600
is linda's face and all the time

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,239
linda when linda was typing the answers

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,719
to you

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:53,280
in stream chat she was

00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:56,320
smiling to you and it was so beautiful

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,120
and all the love around this moment

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,000
is so touching that i'm going to start

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,600
crying

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,439
soon this is something this day i

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
absolutely didn't remember that you can

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,240
actually see my yes

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,280
i actually can see to your faces

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,680
front of me but no worries

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
but i just wanted to deliver to our

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,920
audience how

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,880
how with with full love with full of

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,520
love

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,840
you have been with your answers and the

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,880
audience

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,960
said about your presentation that

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,400
amazing production value love the

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,799
kitchen setting

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,439
you are truly loved in this community

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,610
and we

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,680
all are getting really hungry

00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,880
[Laughter]

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,079
and also there was a thanks about the

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,880
how this uh presentation brings a new

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,079
metaphor

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,200
that a commenter can use when mentoring

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,399
a juniors

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,960
and newbies very very nice

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
and also there was a thought about the

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,040
pandemic

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,399
with all the drawbacks this has made

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,520
conferences so

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,600
much more interesting can we do this on

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,879
live events later

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,080
at the normal world and

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,920
also as mijo said

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,400
in in comments we really appreciate

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,959
you embracing the conference being

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,400
remote and pushing your talk to some

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,680
heights simply impossible to do

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,519
on in-person conference yeah i don't

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
think any conference organizers would

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,800
appreciate coming in with saying like i

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,800
want a full-blown kitchen

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
no but i love the comments and i would

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,239
absolutely agree

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,599
with the idea that in some ways this

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,879
year has pushed my

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,760
way of telling my story into a new

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,160
direction

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,920
yeah and as many of you probably i

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,840
noticed there were some familiar faces

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,280
from like 10 years ago

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,920
um i've been telling this story about

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,720
how we could reimagine what technology

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,879
looks like for

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,200
quite a long time already and i was

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,000
getting bored of myself already so

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,640
just going with the slides and talking

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,560
and then when

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
all of that stopped for a moment it

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,200
really gave me like a new

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,560
uh moment to think about how could we

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,480
tell stories if we were not limited by

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,760
by the conference stage and kind of the

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,120
setup we have there

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,680
and i do think that there's an

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,319
interesting kind of um

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
similar thing happening in the world of

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,000
conference

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,519
software as well because it almost feels

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,480
like we're at the same

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,200
cusp of like making internet native

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,519
software

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,480
for communities whether it's discord

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
whether it's

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,000
uh fortnite whether it's another um the

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,040
minecraft server

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,120
euroco has here and

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,599
i'm really excited about the future i do

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,000
love uh the physical conferences as well

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,120
but

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,879
um i think this also offers so much so

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,640
much opportunities that

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,319
now that like the biggest maybe

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,560
stressful part of the pandemic is over

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,879
we can definitely learn from

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,799
love the vision and now we have two

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,000
questions

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,439
how different is is to teach kids and

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,480
software developers

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,000
are we the same

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,560
yeah um i actually

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,800
i do in some ways think you are the same

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
i i'm not sure if this is okay to say

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,360
but

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
i think actually sometimes six-year-olds

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,800
are easier to teach because they don't

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,240
have these preconceived

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,680
notions of what it means to be good or

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,040
bad or like what other people are doing

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,120
and how they are doing things and they

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,720
don't have ego so much

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,720
so in that sense they are easier but

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,919
then kids can be very hard

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,479
as an audience and they can

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,240
offer you a lot of immediate feedback if

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,080
their interest is not picked

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,320
actually another pandemic project i

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,160
worked on last year

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,520
was the series called computer science

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
in 60 seconds

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,600
um and the idea there was to make these

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,759
60-second short videos

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,880
explaining the core concepts of computer

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
science

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,639
uh just like wes anderson or sofia

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,560
coppola would do

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,400
them and that's where kind of the idea

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,560
for the mushroom uh

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
the pancake stacking came from so we

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,400
played a lot with like making

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,400
ideas visible and i do think that a lot

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,680
of universities have also been using

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,479
those videos and

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,919
kind of uh as an additional pathway into

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
programming so in that sense i think

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,720
every beginner is

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,560
a beginner and requires empathy and

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,880
kind of um yeah like just

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
friendliness from the instructor yeah

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,960
that is true and

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,240
but we adults we do have some kind of

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,800
self-said

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,639
boundaries and fears that kids don't

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,759
have and we probably should

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,560
learn from the kids some some things

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,120
oh sometimes we're very focused on

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
learning

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,960
certain skills or certain technologies

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,560
like going into

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,280
a new project saying i want to learn

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,400
this new react framework or whatnot

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,039
uh whereas the kids uh sure they have

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
some

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,080
application for their learning but i

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,919
think

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,160
most of my teaching has to do more with

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,360
teaching them about curiosity and

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,199
fearlessness fearlessness and

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,960
uh sort of creativity when it comes to

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,319
technology not necessarily like a

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,759
specific thing

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
and i think those attitudes will

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,000
actually help you much further along

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:32,160
well said well said also a question

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
how can us mere mortal developers help

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,800
people to learn how to code

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,960
i think so maybe like two words about my

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,639
background in the ruby community

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,680
this was like the community that helped

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,880
me see

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,280
the human side of technology and made me

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,960
fall in love with

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,400
both the humans who were writing the

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,400
code but then also the

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,680
expression of the code itself and it

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,440
took me a while to get

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
here so in 2009 or 2010 when i was first

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,319
starting with

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,400
programming it very much felt like

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,680
something that was remote and different

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,800
and then i ran into matzi's work i ran

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,960
into wise poignant guy to ruby i like

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
started visiting the conferences and met

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,400
all of these people who

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
were so passionate about what they were

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,639
doing they were bringing

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,400
brimming with excitement and then i

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,680
realized that actually hey like there's

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,960
a whole

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,080
field of people who care and i think

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,639
showing that passion

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,160
and showing that caring is one key to

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,560
making other people

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,280
excited and interested and there's this

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,800
um

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,960
poet called mary oliver who

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,879
writes beautiful poems about nature but

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
she has this one line where she says

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,560
that

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,879
attention is the beginning of devotion

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,960
and what i take her to mean with that is

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,919
kind of the idea that whatever we pay

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,039
attention to

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,479
we learn to love and so often technology

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,960
and coding and

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,960
software are things that kind of mere

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,360
mortals which in this case i would take

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,160
are the people who don't code who don't

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
have this

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,319
superpower in their hands uh

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,479
so often uh they are things that like

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,479
mere mortals can't pay attention to they

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,919
don't have the language or the

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,800
lens to kind of create that devotion

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,560
so the best way you can help our layman

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,560
learn about technology is

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,919
i think just talk about what ex what

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,680
what makes you excited

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,360
and help them pay attention and help

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,800
them help them see

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,159
um in a friendly and non-preachy way

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,760
yes talk about how the tech is

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,159
tool for the bigger bigger bigger things

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,040
how to it's a tool to make a better

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,800
world

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,640
there's a lot of communities and

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,839
volunteering and and being

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:56,080
as ambassador and this is a really good

00:08:51,839 --> 00:09:00,320
way to make a impact

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,120
this is amazing this is this um

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,279
let oh i found one question beautiful

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,519
presentation linda i am curious by

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
nature so asking why questions sounds

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,200
familiar

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,160
to me how can we contribute to building

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
a healthy

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,600
tech environment where we focus more on

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,720
why

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,080
and what we do

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,640
ah there's some living organisms out

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,959
here

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:30,000
we have that too yeah um

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,480
i think it starts with imagination i

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,160
think

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,160
in order to be curious about the world

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,959
you need to have imagination

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,959
and so often the kind of imagination

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,720
we're being offered around technology is

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,399
focused on dystopias

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,880
so it's an interesting thing that

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,920
there's like maybe two episodes of black

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,040
mirror that are

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,760
not mere dystopias that offer even if

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,800
it's not like

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,680
utopia at least some sort of like uh

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,640
softness and um like a vision about the

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,839
world that is not

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,720
completely um completely

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,600
dystopian and i think that's something

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,240
we've lost

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
uh for maybe because the like progress

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,959
in the

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,399
uh especially in the software field has

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,399
been so fast

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,200
uh in the recent years we've become

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,880
these almost like semi semi gods

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,040
in our own mind thinking that we're

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,600
ready yet already that we've done it

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,079
we've like

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,800
invented the kind of world we wanted to

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,000
live in and

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,360
in certain parts ways that is true but

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,519
then in others i think we need

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,600
that kind of like almost utopian

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,120
thinking about what could we do next and

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,320
where could we be directing

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,320
our industry to and i look a lot at

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,920
history right now so that's been

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,399
kind of a passion of mine for the past

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,320
a few years is looking at especially

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,160
like the 1960s i think they would they

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,519
had this sense of like can do

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,519
and um man on the moon and

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,279
and also just this excitement around

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
technology and looking at like what kind

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,839
of communities were driving change

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,920
then who were the people who influenced

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,920
the technology we have today

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,360
uh because kind of the life cycle of

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,680
technology can

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,800
be quite uh long even though when we

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,160
look at like

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,959
uh the past 10 years or so it's it seems

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
like that's that

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,959
life cycle but i think actually we're

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,920
looking at a far uh longer life cycle

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,000
here

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,040
so yeah i think that is like one answer

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,240
to the question is

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,600
is imagine utopias and and try to

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,120
uh try to like not think that we are at

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,959
the height of technology right now

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,800
even though in some ways the rest of the

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,839
world is making us believe that

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,760
um in in the way or i am well

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,600
yeah technology used to be kind of an

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,920
underdog and now now we're kind of

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,720
no we won and i think that sense of

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,839
winning

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,800
is that is re is what is really bad for

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,279
us

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,760
if that makes sense um amazing answers

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,480
and

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,360

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,519
beautiful
