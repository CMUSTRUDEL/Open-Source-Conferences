Title: Don't Develop Just for Yourself - A Developer's Checklist to Accessibility (Eeva-Jonna Panula)
Publication date: 2021-06-03
Playlist: Euruko 2021 - Day 1
Description: 
	Developer, are you (unconsciously) developing sites for users just like yourself? It often means a sighted mouse user with good fine motor skills and who is proficient with computers. But not every user is like that.

Many projects have automated accessibility checkers, and that is a good start. However, they don’t catch most of the failures on accessibility. There are some fairly simple checks to ensure a better experience for your users, and from this talk, you’ll learn how to do them and, most importantly, why they are essential to do.

our next speaker is

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:11,599
panula also known as ebis

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:16,000
i will help you with the typing the aves

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:18,400
to chat evis is a front-end focus

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
software developer who wants to make the

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,880
web

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:27,800
a better place for all of us

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,039
she is iap certified professional in web

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,480
accessibility and is on a continuous

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,920
journey to learn

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,399
more about the accessibility

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
she wrote her first lines of code when

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,879
she was a teenager

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,399
but the lack of role models got her away

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,960
from programming she got a degree

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,520
in the russian language but finally got

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
back to coding and became a software

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,879
developer

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,120
instead of a translator in our luck

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,160
when she is not coding or talking about

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,199
the coding she

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,040
spends her time playing ultimate frisbee

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:10,159
or exploring the world with the kayak

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,600
how exciting and today evie

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,520
is asking if you as a developer

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,640
are maybe unconsciously developing sites

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,640
for users

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,360
just like yourself it often means a

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
sighted mouse user with good fine motor

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,520
skills

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,920
and who is proficient with computers but

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,360
not

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,680
every user is like that

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,759
many projects have automated

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
accessibility triggers and that is a

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,119
good start

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,000
but however they don't catch most of the

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,680
failures

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,680
on accessibility there are some fairly

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,759
simple checks to ensure a better

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,680
experience for

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:57,280
your users and from this stock you

00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:01,280
and i will learn how to do them and most

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:05,360
importantly how they are essential to do

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:09,840
so don't develop a trust for yourself

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:14,080
a developer's checklist to accessibility

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,120
eva na please welcome

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,599
we as developers we often tend to

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
develop

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,760
sites for users like ourselves that

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,239
often means a sighted mouse user who has

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,480
a

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:32,879
good fine motor skills and could be

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,000
described as a power user and

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,570
not all users are like that and this

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,040
can create

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,360
[Music]

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,040
usability problems and also

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
accessibility problems sometimes they

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,120
are

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
the same but

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,040
we need to do something about it and um

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,959
today i am uh trying to provide

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,319
some um fairly cheap simple checks

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,400
how we can ensure as developers that

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,000
our sites are at least a bit more

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
accessible for our users

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,440
this talk has been written for

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,040
i could say for those people who are in

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,720
the beginning of their accessibility

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,599
journey

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,159
you might be you you might know that

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,280
okay

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,400
accessibility is an important topic but

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,360
you maybe don't know how to start

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,720
or what to do or it all feels a bit

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,040
overwhelming

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
or it's possible that you don't have any

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,480
idea what i'm

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,040
talking about and that's okay too

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,480
because it's good that you are here you

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,680
are listening and i hope

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,840
that you will learn something from this

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,400
talk

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,159
so my name is evan nopanola or eve

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,280
espanola

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:59,040
and i'm a software developer at futurist

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,080
in finland and

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,720
i'm also a certified professional in

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,760
web accessibility and um

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,250
when i started to learn to code again

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,360
i could say um

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,360
[Music]

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
well the first things i was learning

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
were um

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,360
html css a bit of basic javascript

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,759
but then like the first actual um

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
framework i was using or learning was

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,240
actually ruby on rails

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,240
so i have history there even though like

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,440
uh nowadays i'm i'm mostly doing

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,400
front-end focus stuff

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,919
so that means for me it's usually react

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,960
and typescript and

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:46,320
such things so yeah

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,320
um today we are uh talking

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,120
a bit about um automated testing i'm not

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,000
gonna go

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
deep into that topic but a couple of

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,080
words

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,960
from that and

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,080
then i will present these checks the the

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,120
title of the

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
talk promises

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,720
so yeah all right

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
let's start with automated accessibility

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,080
testing

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,000
um and maybe start with some definitions

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,160
here or what i mean when i'm

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,520
talking about automated testing in

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,800
accessibility

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,160
so basically it's

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,639
all those tools that take some piece of

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,479
code

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,199
and then go through it and pro

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,840
programmatically

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,600
check if there are some i could say

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,800
failures or problems

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,000
regarding to well accessibility

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,600
and um good examples of these

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,880
failures for example or or problems

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,840
are if you have an

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,319
image image tag and then it doesn't have

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,120
the alt attribute which is a alternative

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,080
text like you can give alternative text

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
to that image

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,280
and it's me if it's missing well those

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,120
tools can actually find um

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,800
find out that because it's something

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,000
that that's programmatically

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,960
um well findable basically

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,600
or another thing is that if your html

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,759
document

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
doesn't have the lang attribute in in

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,720
the html deck

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,120
these things are easy to find for for

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,240
like

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,560
uh those kind of programs

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,039
but that's not like

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,759
the truth is that studies have found

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,039
that

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,280
um well depending on the study these

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,880
automated testing tools can find only

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,600
from 15 to

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,880
40 50. well it really depends on the

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,919
study and method

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,400
methodology and and like well lots of

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,319
things

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,520
but only from 15 to 40 or 50

00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,400
of those failures so there is still like

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,360
even if the result is best so 50 this

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
means that

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,599
half of the problems are still nowhere

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,000
to be found

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:13,039
but with like automated testing

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,720
so that's why we need to check manually

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:20,960
too and

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,880
now i can move on to those um checks

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,240
i promised so

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,639
first thing to check is to

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
go through your site with navigating

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,039
only

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,639
uh with a keyboard so no mouse

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:43,120
not at all and then just try to um

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,360
go through your site check if if you can

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,080
you know all the time where you are you

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,680
know well where the focus is

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,160
and um that you can use every piece of

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,599
control there is everything that you

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,639
could use with a mouse you could

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,400
you can use with a keyboard too

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,680
and this is really important for those

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,039
who are navigating with

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,800
for example just a keyboard or keyboard

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:13,360
emulating devices or screen reader users

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:16,360
because they also use um

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,489
keyboard for navigation i'm going to

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,489
[Music]

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,639
demo here a bit about the problems you

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,240
might find and

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,440
maybe give some info how to uh maybe fix

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,880
them

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,080
so yeah all right let's start um

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,080
okay let's go there so i'm navigating

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,560
to this site here with a keyboard so i'm

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,440
basically tabbing to the site when i'm

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,200
doing things so

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
i try to tell when i'm i'm doing this

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,360
tab so all right

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,000
right now the focus is on a link that

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,120
says that i am a visible link

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,640
and um there is this um

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,440
like border around it it's

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,320
red or or pink depending on the screen

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,360
basically

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,480
and now i'm uh now i'm on a check box

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
but like now that i i started navigating

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,839
from here

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,120
you'd maybe think that uh the next place

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,600
where the focus would go

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,240
is that button which is i am also

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
visible

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,880
so let's test i'm gonna tab okay now we

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,800
are nowhere to be found let's

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:30,640
try again nope and then nope

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,560
and final try okay yeah here we are

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,120
uh so we got lost for a second

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,600
and the reason actually for this is let

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,800
me go

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
back i'm gonna toggle the the checkbox

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,120
there

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,399
but the reason is that um

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,640
i had a list of links which was hidden

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,240
and and the way it was hidden uh was

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,600
with the

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,519
uh css uh or

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,720
yeah i could say the way it was hidden

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,360
wasn't the css

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,839
display none but i just had moved the

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,640
list

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,600
out from the view so basically um

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
position

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,720
positioning it outside from the view and

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,079
that's

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,360
a fairly common pattern when

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,160
doing something like navigation menus

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
and if you just like move the content

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,279
out of the view

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,640
it means that it doesn't get removed

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,040
from the dom

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,959
it doesn't get removed from focus order

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,000
so that's why

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,120
the focus still goes there goes to those

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,079
links

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,200
and you know for for those who are using

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,279
only a keyboard

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,120
that's that can be really confusing

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,959
because for a long time they might not

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
know where they are because like i had

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,480
here

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,120
only three links but i've seen sites

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,279
with

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,560
navigation like items in navigation menu

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,640
like i don't know maybe 20

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,320
of them so that that would be a really

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,360
long time to find find your way

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,920
out from there so yeah

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,040
that's first thing about well

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,079
disappearing focus

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,480
is the theme in the first two things i'm

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,680
gonna

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,839
uh show here and then uh

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,720
another thing now that i'm in the button

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,920
that says i am also visible

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,959
um next place you would imagine i would

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,880
go is the

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:26,480
um i have no focus indicator link

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,839
and then to this but i have link

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,600
let's see okay focus is lost again

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,720
and now we're back and as you might

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,200
guess um the

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,560
like the i have no focus indicator link

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,000
didn't have any focus

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,120
indicator so that like around or those

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,640
borders around the

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:54,240
link and um i had removed it

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:57,680
with a outline non-css

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,120
code i could say and um

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:05,440
where i like it's important to

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,120
not to remove that that focus indicator

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,720
um i've been in a situation where

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,160
designer told me that no

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,560
we're not gonna have that because it's

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,040
ugly i should have said that

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,680
yeah well it's your kind of your job to

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,920
make it

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,440
beautiful but at that point i wasn't

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,160
brave enough and

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:28,079
kind of sad about it but um

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,399
yeah so let's not remove that outline

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,000
only if we are adding something even

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,040
more visible then we can

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,680
um remove the outline but

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,120
let's remember to have the those like um

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,200
visible

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,720
focus indicators all right uh

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,720
there is still like for um keyboard

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,639
navigation there is another thing i

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,360
wanted to talk about

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:58,399
and that's um unusable controls

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,320
and um you might think that

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,000
this uh button or so called button here

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,200
which has click me

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,480
would be working as expected but let's

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,839
check all right i'm gonna

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,519
click it with a mouse and um

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,800
i got a alert saying click happened

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,240
all right so yep now i'm

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,480
okay i need to yeah all right

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,760
we are back in in the in the place i

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,880
wanted us to be

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:33,040
with the focus so next

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:36,320
i will try to tap do that um button

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,440
and um then

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,199
maybe try to interact with it and

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,320
everything so let's see what happens

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,680
all right yeah it just like the focus

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,680
just went past

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,760
the button so yeah from my like

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,240
what i've been saying here about so

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,160
called button and button and everything

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,279
um you might guess that it's not

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,800
actually a button

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:05,680
it's a div which has a on click handler

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:09,360
there which well triggers that alert

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,880
so for like

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,880
a mouse user this would be fine a div

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:20,560
style as a button yeah it would work

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:24,639
uh but for a keyboard user

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,560
or screen reader user um

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,560
those who navigate only using their

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,240
voice so voice command user um

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,880
it's not working like it's not

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,360
usable it doesn't have the like you

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,639
can't tap to it you can focus to it

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,839
uh you can't um interact with it

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,040
with a keyboard and then like for screen

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,760
reader users they

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,800
don't even know that there is such thing

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,320
because there is no role of button

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,680
so that's um

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,240
yeah that's a problem so

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,240
even if you don't remember anything else

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,760
from this talk i hope that you remember

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,959
that whenever you need to

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:13,199
create a button or or some other um

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:16,480
control that already has a

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:20,240
native html element you would use that

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,399
element that semantic html element so

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,720
for example a button there and

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,760
please don't do it with divs because

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
it's it's just

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,199
like you could do it in a way that it's

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,680
usable

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,920
by all but it really requires work and

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,600
and it's harder to maintain

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,880
so yeah i hope that you remember that

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,079
use native semantics instead of divs for

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,320
example for buttons

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:49,600
buttons so yeah all right

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:54,399
um the next thing to check

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:57,839
is to check if color alone is used

00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,440
if we were using color

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,000
alone to communicate some some um

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,440
information that would mean that the

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,959
information would

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,079
get lost for actually pretty many

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,759
um users

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,440
so for example

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,519
those who have some sort of color

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,720
blindness it's possible that they don't

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,839
really um get the idea if

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,880
if the color combination is is

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,160
um problematic for for their their type

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,519
of color blindness

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,560
or screen reader users

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,920
well the if the color is

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,680
only with um made with for example css

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,519
they don't ever get it because

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,959
uh screen readers don't really

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,480
communicate the styles

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:52,399
of the page meaning css

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,600
and then um color is actually a cultural

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,959
thing

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,759
so for me i would see red

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,639
as a like maybe a warning sign or or

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,920
maybe a bad

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,400
thing or i would see it as a negative

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,839
thing

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,959
maybe and then green would be a positive

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,600
thing

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,480
but that's not in every culture it's not

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:19,280
like that

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:21,199
so um that's why also like

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,520
using color alone can be really

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,959
problematic

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,400
and um i wanna um introduce

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,600
one way we could use to check if color

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:38,160
alone is used on our sites

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:41,360
um for example

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,000
or yeah i made an example here uh

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,240
with a table which has collection of

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
courses from my first degree so it was

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,720
russian language and culture as

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:56,160
emilia mentioned in my um introduction

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,280
and yeah i've added colors to tell how i

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,720
felt about the

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,520
um chorus this is these courses

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,919
where in the first year i was studying

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,039
and

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:10,559
if you s if you can see colors

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,640
and um and and like differentiate them

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,120
from here and also if you

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,240
if they translate to you the same way as

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,280
for me

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,520
then you would think that okay um

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,799
so russian history and culture and fun

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,320
theory of phonetics

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,400
were something that i wasn't really

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,200
happy about or there were some problems

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,600
yeah if you're interested i can like in

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,480
some

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,200
later time tell the problems i i had

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,320
there but

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,320
yeah and then um

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,440
that translations from russian to

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,240
finnish

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,480
they were okay but like i maybe didn't

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,720
hate it but i didn't love it

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,000
or there was something some difficulties

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,480
or something

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,600
and then russian grammar and russian

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,720
literature were something that i i

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,760
i liked but if we open

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,880
our um dev tools

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,000
and um from dev tools i'm gonna make it

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,880
a little bit bigger we from

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,559
um is in control dev tools uh by the way

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,200
i'm using chrome here so this

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,160
is this should work in all chromium

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,600
based

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,160
newer browsers i'd say so customize and

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,480
control

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,280
dev tools and then there is this more

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,200
tools

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,280
and in more tools there is uh rendering

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,400
uh rendering is a like place where you

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,360
can

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,080
well do lots of stuff but like for

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,960
example emulate different things

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,520
and what we are doing here we are gonna

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,919
scroll

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:47,679
down and um there is this

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,240
emulate vision deficiencies

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,960
emulation thing and i'm gonna emulate

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,280
here

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,360
acromatopsia which is a type of colored

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,400
blindness

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,840
where a person can't really see colors

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,360
so now that we look the page

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:08,400
which is in grayscale the

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,679
meaning of the colors changes a bit

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,320
so it seems that maybe um the

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,120
translations from russian to finnish is

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,120
on the

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,880
one side of the scale and then russian

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,760
history and culture and fun

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,360
theory of phonetics are on the other uh

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,360
end of the scale and then russian

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,159
crammer and russian literature they are

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,960
somewhere

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,640
there in the middle so that already

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,240
changes the like how we

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,440
understand the um information in the

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:41,039
table so

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:44,320
yeah that's what i wanted to show

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:48,720
from here so let's not use color

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:52,240
alone for information

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,440
and then a couple of words about

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,480
ability to zoom on mobile

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,200
um there was this time when

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,080
responsive design was understood in a

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
way that when you

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:09,520
are creating something on mobile

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,720
um that mobile design should be

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,600
like unscalable or unzoomable basically

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,640
so like there was this habit of adding

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,240
this

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,640
user scalable no to meta tags

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,600
of the website and that can be really

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,880
problematic for

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,240
for some like there are people who

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,520
um rely on zooming on websites because

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,080
they

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,480
they their vision is not good enough to

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,520
see it without zooming

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,480
but then like if i think myself

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,440
um i like to use like if i see a group

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,320
photo where

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,760
i'm part of the photo i usually want to

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,799
kind of zoom in and check

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,240
how do i look like there but there

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:57,440
might be other reasons for everyone to

00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,240
zoom on a website and sometimes

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,880
pages don't actually work without

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,799
zooming

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,240
but that's that's really a problem that

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,280
developers should fix

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,159
for that side but like um before like

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,640
because things don't happen too quickly

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,280
then like zooming can

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,360
can help to work around with those

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,880
issues for a while before the developers

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,559
can can fix those

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,559
issues so

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:31,600
i could say let's not um disable zooming

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,760
uh on mobile or basically anywhere

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,320
because people rely on that

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,440
and how you can check this is that you

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,039
can take a

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,559
uh actual like mobile device and then

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,840
go on your site or app and try

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,880
zooming with like

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,320
if you can use your fingers it's like

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,880
with usually with two fingers like

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,880
pinching or yeah

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:08,240
so yes that was another one

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:11,280
and then um captions and transcripts

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,720
uh if you can

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,880
like if you have a video you're watching

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,280
but you can for some reason you can't

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,840
have the sound on

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:27,360
um then having captions there

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,679
is a like really good thing for for you

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,520
to

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,799
to to understand what's going on on the

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,240
video and

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,520
like for example i don't like watching

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,159
videos or

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,039
for example in instagram stories uh with

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,919
sound on

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,279
like about ever but especially when i'm

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,960
in a crowded place

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,880
though that hasn't really happened

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,240
lately but like

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,279
maybe at one point again

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,200
but like um i'm really grateful

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,480
grateful for captions because i can

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,520
watch the content

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,760
um like um

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,360
without having the sound on and and

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,640
listening

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,279
but also like okay i

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,559
could have that sound on but then there

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,039
are people

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,159
who are deaf or hard of hearing for

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,640
example

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,240
who really don't have that choice so

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,960
they really

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,760
rely on that having the captions and

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,240
that's why i'm

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,840
i'm actually really really happy that

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,120
here in euroco

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,080
we have these um live captions as well

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,120
so that's really good thing and that

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,720
that should be the

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:40,880
norm actually so yeah

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:44,240
and then about transcripts well

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,799
if you have a podcast or

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,400
something that's uh audio only there

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,880
should be also

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,840
like transcript which is uh like

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,360
basically written

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,520
version of everything that's said or or

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,080
like

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,000
every important sound also on the for

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,600
example on that podcast

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,640
because again like um those who can't

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,200
hear

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,279
can't really well listen to that audio

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,880
only content so

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:18,240
that's why transcripts are essential

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,360
so the

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,279
check i would suggest here

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,480
is to go if if you have any like

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,600
multimedia

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,799
then uh go through that and um check

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,559
if there are captions available if if

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,760
it's like video content

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:39,120
and um if it's audio only content

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,000
check for transcripts and i could also

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,760
mention

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,840
audio description here that's um well

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,919
the name is pretty descriptive but like

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
um for example videos

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,520
because if you can't really see the

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,520
video so if you are for

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:59,440
for example blind uh having um

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,080
all these um visual details described

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,279
as well like important visual details

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,039
described as well

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,640
that really helps to understand the like

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,080
the content of

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,760
of the video for example

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,520
so that's also a good thing to check

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:21,279
if possible so yeah

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,279
all right um

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,960
that was all i wanted to say so

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,679
basically what i was talking about was

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,320
to test your site with a keyboard and

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,640
try to

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,400
interact with basically everything on

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,400
your site

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:44,080
then check if color alone is used

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,200
uh then uh check for mobile zooming

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,760
that it's possible and then um also

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,400
check for

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,320
captions transcripts and also audio

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,159
descriptions if possible

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,760
i think i remembered all and

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:04,640
i'm in twitter my handle is um

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,640
well this at sign

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,919
s e-e-v-i-s-p a n u l a i hope that i'm

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,400
spelling correctly

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,400
english spelling is not my strongest

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,399
suit i could say

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,520
and also my website is is in

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,799
avis codes so ee v i s

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,840
dot uh c o d a s

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:32,159
and then like uh slash blog so

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,480
slash b l o g then there is also my blog

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,120
and

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,919
i actually published today a blog post

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,279
uh with

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:43,679
these checks and a couple of um

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:49,840
let's say extra checks so um

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,840
that's there as well so thank you

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:58,080
thank you evis

00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,960
yes please sit with me let's give you

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,919
let's give you a short moment to breathe

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,360
when i talk with the audience about

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:11,039
little reminders some people came

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,640
a little bit late today so you can find

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,840
the stream chat

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,799
on the left side panel navigation

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,240
there's a

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,799
stream word and click that the

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,080
stream window opens again and then you

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,440
find the chat

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,720
where actually we are having a lot of

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,279
discussions today and

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,200
thank you for supporting our our

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,480
speakers with the emojis

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,480
and sending love and sending all these

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,600
questions

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:47,679
first of all all these tech problems we

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,159
all have them we have all been there so

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,880
this is the life we are living now and

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,440
and

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,360
even though we if we would be in live

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,399
events something always happens so

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,679
we don't we don't care about that much

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,440
but it's always a little bit exciting to

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,080
be a speaker when everything

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,200
fails around you and your heart starts

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,240
to bound but

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:15,440
we are okay there's a lot of

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,559
chat comments and let's

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,279
start to go through that but uh let let

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,840
me tell you

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:26,720
uh we will add all the links avscave

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,120
to chat i already put your twitter

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,399
account there but we can also

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:36,080
give other links and from other speakers

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:39,440
also the quest uh links

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:43,840
there so

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,840
let's start with the thanks

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,559
i love talks on a11i

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:54,880
it posts your way of thinking so much

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:58,320
and adds any and any new we

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,200
sorry i'm i'm not i'm malfunctioning at

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,799
the right

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,840
at the moment let's try again

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,279
i love talks on a 11

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,640
i it posts your way of thinking so much

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,559
and any new point of view view improves

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,760
your daily developers work

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:21,520
so thanks great demo

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,480
with the crail scale variant

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,559
so let's go to the questions are there

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,760
guidelines on how

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,919
to pestilent focus indicators how

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,039
prominent do they need to be

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,080
what's too simple always struggle with

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,120
the make them work

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,200
and fit in the other layout

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,440
well because they are supposed to stick

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,559
out

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,600
yeah um there are actually guidelines so

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:54,559
um if we

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:58,000
think about the vgax or web

00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,159
content access web access accessibility

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,600
content guidelines these

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,159
appreciations are so hard uh so yeah

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,600
so there is this set of rules how to

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,039
make uh

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,360
what's the kind of the minimum level of

00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:14,399
accessibility

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,720
for sites so web content web

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,080
accessibility content guidelines

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,120
or webcam okay yeah

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,559
do we struggle here today yes we do

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,679
together yes but yeah we got

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:33,279
i could say like this this like short um

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:36,640
thing but it has actually guidelines on

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:40,320
on the like minimum level of contrast on

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,440
um on focus indicators

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,559
too i have to say that i don't

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,320
right now remember was it like uh the

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,279
contrast ratio

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,000
was it one two three or one to four

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,919
point

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,200
five i guess it was one of those but

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,640
yeah that's like the minimum requirement

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:07,519
with an exception of that those

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,519
browser like if you don't touch the

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,000
focus styling at all then

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,399
by these guidelines and success criteria

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,600
it has

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,720
the browser's default default styling

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,600
would be enough

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,960
but i would say still that it's better

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,159
to make make them

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,960
really like well more visible because

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,440
the default default styling it's not

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,039
really

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:39,840
visible so yeah yeah we have

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,840
we need to sometimes the uh

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,120
on the cost of the site's layout we need

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,559
to do

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,919
some stuff yeah and i would say that

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:55,120
it's not it doesn't need to be on the

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,279
cost of yes because like well

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,679
especially if we are working with with

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,320
designers for example or or like

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,960
when we are designing uh the pages we

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,440
have like

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,399
lots of possibilities to make them

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,679
beautiful

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:13,120
yeah so yeah we just need to look at the

00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,760
visualisation and the style like with

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,880
the new

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,360
new eyes yeah yes true it's not that

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,080
hard

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,840
yeah actually it's not that hard so

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,360
there's a lot of questions about this

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,080
topic and there's also lots of

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,880
discussion

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,919
and links useful links and resources

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,159
also there

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,559
and mathias and simon this is for you

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,720
let's pick up the links and the

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,840
resources from the chat because

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,320
chat is not going to be

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,880
alive after the event so let's pick up

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,159
those

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,919
and send them with the newsletter or

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,519
in other way maybe facebook post or

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,559
discord please go

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,600
let's send the resources and links

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,320
via discord to all our

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,880
audience you can find them there later

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,000
and we can add your links there too

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,039
so don't worry we can find you can find

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,040
the evies

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,960
later too so

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,399
and they here are here are actually

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,639
really really good

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:18,320
comments like it benefits everyone but

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:22,159
mostly people using screen readers and

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,599
uh they are here that

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:29,520
there are a lot of tips tips

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:32,720
but the question there has

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,480
there's been much more awareness raised

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,200
on things like security and privacy

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,960
but accessibility is still of the

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,399
neglected

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,119
what you think needs to happen that this

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,800
imbalance would be fixed and is it

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,639
happening already

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,520
in finland we have a quite good

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,079
situation since we have a law

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,720
yeah yeah that's true um the law

00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,400
basically

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:04,480
um coming from the eu side

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,450
um can't remember the exact name

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,640
names of the laws are really hard

00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:11,920
[Laughter]

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,560
but yeah uh we have right now effective

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,760
this law

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,400
where all public sector sites or the

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,520
sites

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,280
or or the sites of the services or

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,400
like well basically every site

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,880
that gets funding from uh public

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,920
sector at least i think the limit was

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,880
like 50

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,680
or something they need to be accessible

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,280
by law so

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,240
this means that they need to comply with

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,960
this vega i was mentioning about

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,680
so that's i think that's a good thing

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,880
there

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,359
and then um if i've understood correctly

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,119
there is

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:52,240
also a law coming up about

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,839
all the um like

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,960
web stores to be accessible to yeah and

00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,599
i think it was the the

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,880
year where it should be in effect the

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,320
latest

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,359
or i think it should come out

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,200
maybe next year i'm like don't trust

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,000
me on like the exact years but like

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,960
within a couple of years and then like

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,640
there will be this

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,800
this period where um companies

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,800
can make them accessible so it's like

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,119
you don't get fined straight away

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,119
after this so that's the situation in

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:34,079
finland currently

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:36,720
and um yeah i think like

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,079
raising up the topics on accessibility

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,960
and speaking about

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,520
different sides and different benefits

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,960
um

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:48,000
that's like one thing to um well raise

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:52,079
awareness on this topic and

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,720
and also like uh when having for example

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,040
code reviews paying attention on on

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,680
things like accessibility it can help to

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,160
um well create awareness basically

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,640
because

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,800
if there is a one developer on on a team

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,119
who really pays attention on this

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,079
then the others will learn too if they

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,280
don't know

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:14,240
already so we need the ambassadors

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,320
of the accessibility like you and the

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,880
question makers because if you

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,200
understand the situation and importance

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,320
of this you can be the ambassador on

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,440
your team

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,160
yes that's true because there's a lot of

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,040
concern

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,040
on the chat about this situation please

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,119
tell me to the chat what is the

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,480
situation in your country

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,960
i think in most of us in eu have the

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,520
same regulation but how about the

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,440
other other people i know there's a lot

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,960
of people example for

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:51,040
america united states then

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,480
our time zone so thank you for being

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,880
here

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,560
what's the situation on there because

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,760
people are asking

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,960
like um now

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,839
i lost the question

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,839
about the

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,440
yeah we did go through that

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,440
um and

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,599
um let me check

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,520
what do you use to automate

00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:26,560
accessibility testing

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,920
yeah that's a good question um first of

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,040
all i have to say that

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,079
i work in the react realm

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,240
basically so like i don't unfortunately

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,280
i don't have any tips on on like

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,000
um well outside that world

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,960
uh or much some of the tools i'm gonna

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,800
mention

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:50,560
next are usable in like well everywhere

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,760
but in in in that world i use like

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:57,200
linters so um

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,359
there is like i i use vs code there

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,680
are good lenders for that and especially

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:05,760
like i think it's

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:09,119
um eslint react jsx

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,480
accessibility so a one one i

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,640
uh so like linters are good then

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,839
uh there are test integrations for for

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,720
example guest or

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,520
cypress which are the the like ones i've

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,640
been using

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,440
lately so but i i guess that

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,400
there is for for other frameworks as

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,520
well

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,400
and then um things that

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,560
every one of us can use on browsers so

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,240
there are browser extensions

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:42,800
um i'm using x

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,920
from dq so ax uh

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,880
e so that's a good one

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,760
for um checking your site on on like

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,520
browser

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:56,320
and then also uh wav from web aim

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,480
so these are a bit different tools but

00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,359
they are both browser extensions and i

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,000
think like they are

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,119
both available for at least chrome

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,359
firefox

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,880
and well edged because it's like

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,800
especially the newer ones

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,359
which are chromium based so yeah yeah

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,480
and we have a comment in a chat that

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,640
from christoph

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,720
automated testing is fine to receive

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,560
heads up for things like missing

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,040
alternative text or bad

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,400
color choices in terms of contrast but

00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,280
unfortunately that doesn't ensure your

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,640
application

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,760
is truly inclusive so we need to focus

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:37,440
more than just automating yes

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,319
the check there's a lot of

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,880
uploading mois it's really hard to find

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,680
the

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,200
questions here but this is amazing give

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,040
keep going on with the

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:52,240
with the chat talk here's uh

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,560
joel giving a link to builder

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,440
inspiration and ideas there's a talk

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,119
about the

00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,400
uk government audit of bunch of

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,960
automated tools

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,800

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:12,000
to you in discord

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,359
well this was a struggle

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,839
for me a little bit for you

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,359
but we've been through a lot with you

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:23,520
lately in this year

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:25,119
and this last year and i think we are

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,520
ready to move on

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,160
but please be ambassadors of the

00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,880
accessibility and

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,560
when you are giving a speech on any

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,880
topic of of

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,079
on events like this please raise

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,440
awareness of accessibility because

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:47,280
diversity and inclusive is really

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:51,359
important to world as maths

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,760
hoped we to create the better world and

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,480
this is a really good way to create the

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,040
better
