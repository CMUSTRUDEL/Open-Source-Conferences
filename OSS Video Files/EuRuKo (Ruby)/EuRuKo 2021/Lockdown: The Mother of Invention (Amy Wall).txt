Description: 
	The last year has been hard on all of us. Cutting through the bad news and the mundanity has required resilience, creativity, and determination. Thankfully, we have had a secret weapon on our side to keep us occupied: Ruby.

Join me as I explore some of the good, the bad, and the just plain hilarious ideas Rubyists have been working on during lockdown. I will survey Ruby lovers of all levels to see what has been holding their attention during this difficult year.

I will also share my own experience with staying busy, including my adventure building an “On Air” alert system for Zoom in my home office space using Ruby.
