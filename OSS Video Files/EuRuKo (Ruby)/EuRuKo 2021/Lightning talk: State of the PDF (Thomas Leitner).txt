Title: Lightning talk: State of the PDF (Thomas Leitner)
Publication date: 2021-06-03
Playlist: Euruko 2021 - Day 1
Description: 
	What are your options when dealing with PDFs in Ruby? Are you creating PDFs? Then you are likely using wkhtmltopdf or Prawn.

What if you need to manipulate PDF files? Are you resorting to calling command line tools like pdftk? Or chaining multiple libraries/CLI tools together?

Have you tried HexaPDF? It is a relatively new PDF library for Ruby which unites all PDF manipulation and creation facilities under one pure-Ruby roof. It is fast with low memory usage and a very Ruby-esque API interface.

The lightning talk will give a short introduction into the available libraries and then focus on the current state of HexaPDF and what it brings to the table.
