Description: 
	Integrated development environment (IDE) is one of the most frequently used tools for programming. Itâ€™s a kind of text editor where you type and read the code, but it does more for you. On-the-fly error reporting, completion, go-to-definition, and more. These features help you writing and reading the code and make the tools more valuable than simple text editors.

I have been working for IDE development to support Ruby programming with a static type checker. It is based on the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and implemented in Ruby.

I want to share my experience. What is the protocol? How can the LSP features be implemented? You will get to know the under-the-hood of IDEs, and the tools will become more familiar to you.
