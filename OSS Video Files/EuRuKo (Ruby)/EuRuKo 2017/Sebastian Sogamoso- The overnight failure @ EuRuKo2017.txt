00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,770
hearing talks for almost two days and we

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,140
just lunch so it's pretty easy to get a

00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,630
bit sleepy I don't blame you but I'll

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:38,640
try to keep you entertained so so you

enjoyed the stock okay yeah my name is

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,660
Sebastian I go by several saga on

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,460
Twitter so I like with people to tweet

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,629
at me during my talks so please do that

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,579
I came all the way from Colombia and if

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,089
everything you know what Colombia is

00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,089
this you should definitely come and

00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:01,739
visit and in fact we have I have it like

00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,989
the perfect excuse for you to go to

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,820
Colombia instead we have a rubyconf in

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:14,070
Colombia so you should all come next

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:16,829
year you're all invited so this is my

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,040
first time in Hungary I'm in love with

00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:22,890
Budapest so beautiful city and I've been

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,500
trying the local cuisine eating

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,240
different things so I took pictures when

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,369
I was sitting and I have really been

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,200
enjoying it well actually I've been like

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,570
taking some cooking classes to improve

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,729
my culinary skills which are kind of bad

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,890
so I decided I wanted to prepare a

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,619
goulash which is a recipe I've always

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,840
liked so I went and look for it I cook

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,299
Pat actually and bought all of the

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,920
ingredients follow all the steps and

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:56,659
then this was a result it was an epic

00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,329
fail I definitely have a long way to go

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:03,840
when actually before we continue I want

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:08,520
to ask everyone a favor so let's take a

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,940
selfie please everyone try to look like

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,060
you're enjoying the conference so

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,440
everyone raise your hand oh crap raise

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,440
your hands make some noise

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:28,680
[Applause]

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:29,420
more water come on cool thanks that was

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,910
fun

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:38,270
now let's get serious so the name of

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,040
this stock is the overnight failure and

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,930
the talk is based on a true story

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:51,810
something that happened to me on my

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:56,910
previous job so I know my previous job

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:59,549
so I would explain why I want to talk

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,459
about this like why would I want to tell

00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:05,010
700 people like about that time I really

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,569
 up ooh and there's actually a lot

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,970
of reasons I'll share a few of them

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,010
right now so at some point we all have

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,480
broken the internet we all have created

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,340
bugs which made it to production and in

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,390
case you're lucky you haven't done it

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,280
believe me it's just a matter of time so

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,060
and we don't already talk about this

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,609
sort of stuff in public normally we see

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,709
people talking about koosy goof stuff

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,010
they have done cool things they have

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,500
achieved but we don't talk a lot about

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,600
failures and unless you're really public

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,760
we know we do it in private like we're

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,700
the close friends or even just

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,959
colleagues and that's something that

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,420
might like actually an a boost the

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,290
impostor syndrome that maybe a lot of us

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,810
have suffered from because we only hear

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,820
the cool stories their success stories

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,750
we don't hear a lot about the epic

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,850
failures until unless they're as I

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,220
mentioned really public kind of like

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,319
what happened to get 11 January which

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,780
someone made a mistake took it down for

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,150
several hours I know I think there's

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:21,209
people from goodlove here so I feel you

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:23,430
and or what happened to Amazon AWS this

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,060
year yeah this year I don't remember

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,139
which one was but someone also made a

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,229
mistake too

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,999
s3 now for several hours and I don't

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,729
know if you remember this but what's

00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:37,259
kind of funny weather like it seems s3

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,270
was down they couldn't update their

00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:46,050
status page to show like the red icon

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:47,460
because the icon was hosted in s3 it's a

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,759
funny story but I can imagine those

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:57,210
people living with us so so stressful so

00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:59,249
even like if most of the like most of us

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:04,860
don't get to work for companies that

00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:07,639
have such a huge scale no matter what

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,740
the skill of like our applications are

00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:14,759
we are all building software that humans

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:19,020
rely on so when we create bugs it can

00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:21,150
get really stressful and that's why I

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,650
mean that comes that takes me to the

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,349
most important reason why I wanted to

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,759
give this talk and it's because it's not

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:29,999
really when we're dealing with big

00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,810
problems when we have something really

00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:36,659
bad going on where we learnt the most

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:39,089
it's not it's not a it's not nice it's

00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:40,979
not a good situation to be in but it's

00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:46,379
at some of the times where we learned

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:48,629
the most so I want everyone to think for

00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,879
a few seconds what's the word thing

00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:54,120
worst thing that could happen for you in

00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,399
work what's the worst the worst thing

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,529
that can happen to you today imagine

00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:04,319
that because that's what happened to me

00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:07,830
so let me tell you the story of how it

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,509
happened I work for this company that

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,419
had a product that was basically like a

00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:14,250
more application that people used to

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:16,169
share a car to go to work so this is

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:20,419
basically how it worked so we had

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:23,490
someone called say Ana and Ana had a car

00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:28,229
and she went every day from home to work

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:31,949
and then she came back so that allowed

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:35,729
Ana to find someone like Alex who didn't

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:38,639
have a car but had a similar commute and

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:41,030
gave them a route it allowed them to

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,640
sync their schedules you

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,440
establish a customer trip and it take it

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,970
took care of everything related with

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,550
money so then when they started writing

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,880
together it would keep record of the

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,890
trips I took and then they could even

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,080
get matched with more people for example

00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,090
like John who had a similar commute to

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,750
them so the three of them could share a

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:08,900
car and the app would keep track of the

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,940
trips and then once a week it would run

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,220
like a payment process and the premium

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,410
process basically did this it would

00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,980
charge Alex and John who were the

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:23,900
passengers and then it would pay Ana for

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,550
the trips where she drove mmm so let I'm

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,720
gonna talk a little bit about how that

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:32,300
payment system was implemented so as I

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,730
said every week process was triggered

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,040
and then the process will go to the

00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:40,340
database get all of the trips from the

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:45,320
past week and put a job in a queue for

00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:47,600
each passenger driver combination so as

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,180
you can imagine that meant that a lot of

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,610
jobs were created each week where this

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,460
payment process was triggered and each

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,130
job contains something like this it had

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,490
a passenger driver combination passenger

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:04,730
driver pair and the amount of money that

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,890
the passenger had to pay the driver so

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:10,580
that basically meant that every week

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:13,940
there was one combination I mean one job

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:18,920
for every passenger driver pair or

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:21,890
combination so after that the queue was

00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,020
processed and the passenger was charged

00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,870
using a payment gateway and then the

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:30,290
driver was paid that part were there on

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:33,290
the circle it was taken care of by the

00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:37,100
payment gateway we were using so we

00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:39,200
didn't really do anything there it was

00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,630
kind of like automating the handle but

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,300
named okay so I know it was a lot of

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,400
information so in case

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,240
you're still not with me let's see what

00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,680
quick recap so the users had a had an

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,300
app that they used to carpool every day

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,650
that will trap

00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,600
sorry track their trips he had a payment

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,080
system that runs once a week that

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,820
payment system charge the passengers and

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,780
paid the drivers that's basically what

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,060
it did so now that you understand the

00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,710
system or the system did let's move to

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:19,800
the part where I tell you what went

00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:23,070
wrong so again well now so this process

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,070
front on Saturdays so when a given

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,940
Saturday morning was 6 a.m. with the

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:31,560
process start running it was triggered

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,540
and that sounds like kind of like a

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,780
timeline for the day a day I like to

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:39,720
call Black Saturday and it's not because

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,000
it was like they were shops or sad

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,070
discounts or it was a holiday or

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,070
something it was a really stressful day

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:58,020
so early that morning after 6 a.m. a

00:09:54,150 --> 00:10:01,710
user went to the store to buy some eggs

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:05,220
bread for breakfast and when she tried

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,600
to pay her card was declined she was

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,020
like what what the hell it doesn't make

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,700
any sense

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,560
so she investigated what was going on

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,550
and she found out that her credit card

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,430
was maxed out and then when she started

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,280
looking at what had happened she saw a

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:23,640
lot of charges from from the carpooling

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:27,840
company I was working for that was

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,460
roughly around 6:25 so that's how it our

00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,310
day is looking so far that's great right

00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,410
the thing is that that user wasn't alone

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:38,070
there were more users that was starting

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:42,930
to notice the same thing and not just a

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,760
few users it was a bunch of users so the

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,230
customer care team started to get like a

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:52,170
huge influx of complaints from users and

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:54,210
so then that Black Saturday I started to

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,100
not look that good it was definitely

00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:59,090
that looking bad

00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,850
so let's see let's say 634 I don't know

00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,890
who's who's up on a Saturday morning at

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,990
that hour but his started reporting a

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,270
lot of problems yeah the same problem

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:12,920
basically I was happily sleeping in my

00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:17,600
bed and who's up at that time and then I

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,850
got a call from my boss and the call

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,220
would kind of like this so my boss tell

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,810
me like hey sorry to call you this early

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,790
but we have a problem with payments in

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:29,390
production and a lot of customers are

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:32,930
complaining about it and I just try not

00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:35,810
to freak out and talking like yeah sure

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,210
I'll take a loot right away let's talk

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:41,150
over chat I thought I had Hank dumped

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:48,170
the phone I was like and then my

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:51,020
brother like hey I'm assuming like we

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:56,270
had a good laugh and then went to work

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:59,900
so it wasn't us not even 7:00 a.m. and

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:01,310
the day was really very crappy when I

00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,440
went to check what was going on I went

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,880
to the payment gateway first and I saw a

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,250
lot of duplicated charges and then when

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,170
I looked at like the payment system I

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,350
found out that it was still full of jobs

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:18,080
and after looking at it again I saw they

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,950
had more jobs that were being created

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:26,840
the two kept growing so I really stopped

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:31,610
the process to not like basically do any

00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:33,290
more charges and got a list together of

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,230
all the charges we had made all of their

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:39,800
like wrong charges we had made and

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:41,720
issued refunds to every user but I

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,390
noticed that even though I have like it

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,300
should refund since like the that last

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:50,960
part the pain the driver's part was

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,420
handled by the payment gateway that was

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,370
still going on so I had to count like

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,440
reversals transfers basically what those

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,170
payments well because otherwise like the

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,060
company would have to pay to cover that

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,530
money even though like the charges were

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,970
reversed so okay so it was like okay

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:12,829
problem fix

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:15,429
yeah good system was stuffed the problem

00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:20,149
was kind of contained at that point and

00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:21,709
then the queue was still food and I

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:24,439
started looking at what what what was

00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:27,439
there and started noticing a pattern a

00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:29,779
lot of jump jobs seem duplicated so they

00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:32,479
were basically like this job marketing

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:33,979
yellow on that queue it was it was there

00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,739
a lot of times so basically contain the

00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:40,970
same passenger driver combination with

00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:43,129
the same amount and the problem was it

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,049
wasn't duplicated like once or twice you

00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:48,139
would duplicate it like thousands of

00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:50,089
times that was pretty bad

00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:52,309
so the problem like looking the whole

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,649
system I know that the the like the

00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:57,709
problems were in two parts two places in

00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:00,470
two bucks basically so the first bug was

00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:02,149
in the code that was in charge of

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,970
getting the information from the

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:08,499
database and putting it in the queue so

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:11,869
basically we should have had like n

00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:13,999
amount of jobs in the queue and because

00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:15,949
of the problem we had we had n square

00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:19,459
amount of jobs so you can imagine the

00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:21,939
amount we had what was happening is was

00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:24,109
that basically instead of putting like

00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:26,089
going through each driver passenger

00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:28,609
combination and putting them once it was

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,379
for for each driver and planet

00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:35,539
combination it was pulling all of them

00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:37,789
in the queue so that was very crappy we

00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:39,979
held tests checking that part we had

00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:41,929
tests checking that the driver and

00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,669
passenger combination was added to the

00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:49,849
queue but we didn't check that it was

00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:54,259
only added once so then the second bug

00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:57,049
was in that part yeah I mean in the in

00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:59,989
the code that was charging the users

00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:03,369
were the red arrow is charging the

00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:05,629
passengers because it just like

00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,309
basically sent anything that it got

00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,869
straight to the payment gateway for it

00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:11,749
to take care of it but it didn't check

00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:15,319
if maybe we had already charged that

00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:17,029
passenger that week that was kind of

00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:18,280
like in the obvious educator we should

00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:20,710
have considered but we

00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:24,160
we didn't so this this combination of

00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:26,920
the walks were was really really bad so

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:31,480
but fixing them was kind of easy so led

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:34,200
by 10:50 a.m. I had green fixes for

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:40,420
those bugs deployed him to production

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:43,240
and after a long day I mean yeah that

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,950
was 10:50 p.m. trying to figure out

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,640
what's going on and after a long day I

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:51,910
felt tired filled um it was first

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,320
frustrating day so right after I deploy

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,320
the fix I started looking for a new job

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,450
well this part is not actually true but

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,840
like this basically explains how I felt

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,840
at that moment

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,010
Nathalie not good so to make a week like

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,610
a quick recap or explain what was the

00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:26,350
situation at that moment so there were

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,720
thousands of users affected by the bug

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:32,500
all of the users were charged a

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,019
different amount and the worst case was

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:39,070
a user who we charged five thousand

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:41,320
dollars it was really bad and there were

00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,290
users who were charged up to two

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,360
thousand two hundred times sorry and in

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,209
fact they weren't charged more times

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,300
because we either maxed out their credit

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:58,050
cards or we basically empty their

00:16:52,300 --> 00:17:02,140
accounts this was really bad

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:04,209
and after seeing these I like I honestly

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,929
have a question like I don't understand

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:11,309
why Matt's things things truven was slow

00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:11,309
because it happened also quick

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,279
[Applause]

00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:32,899
yeah that day I really wanted movie to

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:35,779
be slower yeah okay done then the

00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:37,999
problem was that we had max users credit

00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:42,080
credit cards empty their accounts and

00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:44,090
refunds took up to five business days so

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,139
they couldn't like pay the rent

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:50,480
buy food pay for transportation whatever

00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:53,149
it was really crappy so we had to reach

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,100
out to every user affected thousands of

00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:57,830
people and offer them like an expedited

00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,769
way to refund them well most cases was

00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:03,259
basically like sending them an old check

00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:05,149
good old check which would give them

00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:07,100
their money right away I mean at least

00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:10,759
the next day which was the fastest we

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:14,240
could do this was really really really

00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:16,369
crappy and you like I mean although like

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,440
the worst part was kind of over the next

00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:21,950
following weeks I was still working on

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,429
stuff related to this huge bug helping

00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:27,830
the customer care team deal with every

00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:29,779
problem like checking I mean a lot of

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,889
people writing asking different

00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:37,309
questions so we had to fin respond to

00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:40,039
everyone and it was kind of crappy like

00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:44,179
no one would trust a team that was

00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:48,679
working on the payment system I was of

00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:51,649
course part of it and yeah it was it was

00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:54,139
a really bad situation so going back to

00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:56,629
why I want to talk about this topic it's

00:18:54,139 --> 00:19:00,980
because like embarrassing things happen

00:18:56,629 --> 00:19:04,039
to all of us and we all create some sort

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,889
of problem at some points and you might

00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:09,350
think that if like if it hasn't happened

00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:13,340
to you that you're safe that maybe test

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:16,669
will save you but they want that having

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:19,129
a QA team a person in your company will

00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:24,379
save you but definitely won't we had

00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:25,700
that too so none of this like will

00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,919
guarantee that you won't have bugs

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,299
software's will the humans we will

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,269
eventually make mistake

00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:33,919
and it's really important for us to

00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:37,039
create environments in our companies

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,709
where it's fine to admit problems it

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,779
finds fine to admit that we screw up it

00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:44,329
doesn't have to be this big I really

00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:48,379
don't wish that for anyone but we might

00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:52,849
still screw up at some time and multiple

00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:56,029
times so it's important for people not

00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:57,739
to feel judged to feel yeah to feel safe

00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:00,859
as I was saying expressing their there

00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:05,119
were the problems or the mistakes they

00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:06,379
made and if something's so if something

00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,509
like this ever happens to you and

00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:10,069
believe me if I say it probably will

00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:14,479
just make sure that you understand what

00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:17,049
happened and to fix it basically like

00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:19,849
move slow and don't break things more

00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,619
take your time to find out like a good

00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:23,239
and definitive solution for the problem

00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:25,939
because normally in these type of

00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:27,589
situations Alissa my experience you have

00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:30,949
like a lot of pressure to do things

00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:32,959
quick because the process seems huge so

00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:34,969
it seems like you I mean you have the

00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:37,129
perception that you need to me to move

00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:39,949
really really fast to figure what's

00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:41,569
going on and that's normally not the

00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:43,549
case that's certainly not actually not a

00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:46,609
good idea because you might end up doing

00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:49,819
like making the problem bigger by trying

00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:51,409
to fix it fast take your time think what

00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:54,499
you're doing make sure you understood

00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:58,309
the problem first and then move on and

00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:59,869
fix it so also something is really

00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:01,069
important you should document the

00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:03,259
problem you should the community what

00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:04,969
caused the problem there's a lot of

00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:07,579
weight I mean there's like people that

00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:09,969
can go really deep into that doing like

00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:12,379
root cause analysis that's pretty useful

00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:13,189
and you document you should document how

00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:15,169
you fixed it

00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,549
and what lessons you learned what are

00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:18,739
you doing to prevent this from happening

00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:19,509
again if we don't know comment this type

00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:22,459
of things

00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:23,929
we're losing like one of the most

00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:26,240
important things that we can learn from

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,770
it which is like

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,049
having a memory or having a history of

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,970
what happened so that we can prevent it

00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:35,760
from happening again so that anyone in

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:38,010
the team can can know that to know how

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,260
to prevent the same type of problems and

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,929
also to create a culture where we admit

00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:46,650
that we have problems but that we also

00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:48,480
take responsibility for them and fix

00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,360
them the best way possible it's not

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,070
about like doing good blame and going to

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,820
the source code and see who wrote the

00:21:53,070 --> 00:22:00,059
lines or the piece of software that had

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,250
the bug or the bugs because it's not

00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:05,130
about just like pointing pointing

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:09,419
fingers and telling who who who's in

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:12,270
fault basically and always remember

00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:16,020
you're not your failures it's all

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:19,440
temporary even if it's Lou if it looks

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,130
really bad at some point you will look

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,480
at it

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,669
it will be in the past you'll laugh

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:28,860
about it you go to confidence to speak

00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:30,929
about it and it's yeah a lot of people

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,909
say you're not your box so you're also

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:35,460
not your failure I mean you're not your

00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:39,299
code so you're also not your boxing your

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:42,510
failures so I would like to invite

00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:44,460
everyone to share their failures their

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:48,510
like bad stories I know they're calling

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:51,030
that as bad but just use the conference

00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,100
a hashtag tweet them I would really like

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,710
to see other people hear other people's

00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,120
stories and you can come to me later

00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,370
after we talk and tell me your stories

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:05,640
