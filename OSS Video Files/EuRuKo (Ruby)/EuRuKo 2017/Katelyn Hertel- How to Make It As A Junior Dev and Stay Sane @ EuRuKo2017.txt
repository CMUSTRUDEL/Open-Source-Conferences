[Applause]

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,460
all right hi guys um this is so strange

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,500
for me I'm usually used to being the one

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,779
sitting in the audience rather than

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:31,410
being onstage so if you didn't guess

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:33,899
this is my first talk so anyway so yeah

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,120
did everyone enjoy the after party last

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,440
night are you as tired as I am cuz I'm

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,540
exhausted but anyway my name is Caitlin

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,700
hotel and I'm here to speak to you about

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,850
how to make it as a junior dev and stay

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,160
sane it's a little less technical than

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,160
some of the other talks but I'm here to

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,820
remind you that we're all human we might

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,400
code 24/7 and it might be in front of a

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,079
computer all day every day but we are

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,000
human and we need to treat ourselves

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,860
like humans and take care of ourselves

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,420
so that we can succeed before I continue

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,740
with the show of hands how many of you

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,260
would consider yourselves to be a

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,880
beginner in the tech industry or a

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,350
junior developer all right and how many

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,420
of you would consider yourselves to be a

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,140
senior developer or involved in

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,780
management all right a lot more cool ok

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,570
so this talk is actually kind of for

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,060
both groups of people it's a little

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,640
focused on junior developers but at the

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,619
end of my slides I'm gonna actually talk

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,020
to the senior developers and the

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,000
managers in the room and how they can

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,490
help the junior developers to succeed

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,590
because we want our juniors developers

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,340
to succeed in order to have our team be

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,530
successful so let's start with a quote

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,780
you don't have to learn to walk by

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,330
following rules you learn by doing and

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,250
falling over by Richard Branson this

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,170
code is here to remind us that not

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,830
everything is always going to run

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,049
smoothly

00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,000
sometimes we're gonna fail sometimes

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,099
we're gonna fall and sometimes we're

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,200
gonna get overwhelmed and burn out and

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,970
that's what happened to me

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,380
and

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,890
is my story about how I picked myself

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,020
back up and kept going so my name is

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,270
Caitlin hotel I live and work in New

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,850
York City I work for a company called

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,810
News cred where I'm a CSE or customer

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:29,260
support engineer I love dogs I travel

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,300
the world in fact I just got back from

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,060
an orphanage in Bolivia where I was

00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,580
actually teaching code using MIT scratch

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,320
program it was actually really

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,300
successful and by the end of the two

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,360
weeks and my classes I had some of the

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,580
orphans teaching for me it was very

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,860
successful and if you are interested in

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,720
MIT scratch program come see me later

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,120
I'll explain all about it it's a great

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,590
program and you can find me on Twitter

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,780
at caters to taters

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,750
I'm very responsive on there so feel

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,420
free to reach out so how did I get here

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,000
I studied history in classical studies

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,190
at Seton Hall University but I quickly

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,260
realized that learning ancient Greek and

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,500
Latin was really not gonna get me very

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,080
far in life and there's just really not

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,750
a big career path for that so I talked

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,070
to some friends some family and people

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,080
were pointing me in the direction of

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:24,110
tech so I decided to do the tech

00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,230
bootcamp block dot IO where I studied

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:30,350
Ruby on Rails so I did this in February

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:33,440
of 2016 and during that time I met my

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:37,459
mentor my best friend Brittany Martin

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,760
and Brittany Martin is just she's an

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:42,590
angel I think it's very important for

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,019
all of us to have mentors in our life

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:48,410
and Brittany was has always been there

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:50,209
for me she helps me with technology she

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,130
helps me with life and she was there for

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:56,750
me when I was definitely burning out and

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,980
ready to quit so before I continue I

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,709
mentioned that I work for a company

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,780
called new spread but what is new spread

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,490
news cred is a global leader in

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,590
enterprise content marketing

00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,510
content marketing is a strategic

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,800
marketing approach focused on creating

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,680
and distributing valuable and relevant

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,860
blah blah blah blah that's a lot of

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,230
words but what does that actually mean

00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,450
basically that means is we distribute

00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,430
content in all forms of media through

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,980
either original or licensed content

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,260
original content is written by our new

00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,260
spread team and licensed content comes

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,930
from any one of our 2,800 publishers

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,760
like the New York Times and these look

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,770
these articles can be published to your

00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,700
blog your WordPress your website

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:44,340
whichever it is we also do CMS design

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:48,270
and we have our own platform which we

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,620
maintain and fix so if there's ever a

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,220
customer that comes to us and says

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:56,460
there's a bug or something went down or

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,130
literally anything broke on the platform

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,800
that's where CFCs come in we fix all the

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,170
problems we also drive product

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,000
adaptation help with integrations and

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:10,350
assist with onboarding new customers who

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,150
are to the platform so this let's talk

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,490
about my first job because this is

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,380
actually where I hit burnout status and

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,030
that's kind of what this talk is about I

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,810
worked for a content distribution

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:25,170
network or a CDN basically what a CDN is

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,870
is if you have a request so you're type

00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:31,230
in Twitter calm user request we'll go to

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,240
the server and we as a CDN sit in

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,940
between the server and the request and

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,290
we actually cache the content so you

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,450
don't have to go all the way to the

00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,810
server you just come straight to the CDN

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:45,300
which makes it faster and cheaper so I

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,800
was doing my bootcamp and I actually got

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,410
hired three whole weeks before I

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,220
graduated that bootcamp so I started my

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,530
first job in May of 2016 and I did about

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,800
two weeks training in San Francisco and

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,230
then as soon as I got done with that I

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,570
came back to New York and on day one in

00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:07,710
New York I got the opportunity to work

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:12,480
on two really big projects ipv6 and HTTP

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,990
- I was so excited Here I am brand new

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,270
to this

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,030
world someone who has zero experience

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,630
and I get these two big projects I'm

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:24,600
basically my first day I was excited to

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,850
do this but I had no idea how much work

00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,850
was involved with these two projects I

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:32,880
had to send out hundreds of invites to

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,760
beta testing open countless tickets and

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,430
on board anyone that was interested in

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,520
these two products that was a lot of

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:44,130
work to be doing on top of being hired

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,780
as a customer support engineer so I was

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:52,740
trying to do both and in August I hit

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:55,530
burnout status and I hit it very hard

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,930
in fact when September came around I was

00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:02,250
actually convinced that I was going to

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:05,280
quit and so I knew something had to

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,750
change and so these are the steps that I

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,500
took to turn it all around

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:13,020
I learned to ask for advice I managed my

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,560
time better I spoke up when something

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,870
didn't feel right I learned to say no

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,260
set goals and I started to take care of

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,780
myself myself and these are things that

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,570
might seem obvious or self exclamatory

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,030
but sometimes we get so caught up in our

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,460
everyday jobs and lives that we forget

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,370
these simple steps so I'm here to remind

00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:39,780
you so let's start with asking for help

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:42,840
or advice it's really hard and I think

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:46,860
it's hard for everyone in any profession

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,280
and so for me I was afraid that my

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,610
questions were stupid or dumb and made

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,060
me sound uneducated I mean I was a

00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:00,780
junior developer surrounded by senior

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:03,510
developers and I was the only one so

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:06,150
asking a senior developer a question was

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:09,690
really scary for me and I think it's

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,670
scary for a lot of people so I ended up

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,710
learning and accepting that in

00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,440
technology there are no dumb or stupid

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,660
questions at the end of the day we have

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,729
deadlines we have code that needs to be

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,759
submitted and bugs that have to be

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:25,800
fixed so if you're asking questions to

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,199
get to that end of the day goal it's not

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,490
stupid in fact it makes you seem eager

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:35,250
and wanting to learn so definitely not

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,459
something to be afraid of because

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:43,949
remember when you need advice you should

00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:46,949
just ask asking is not bad and when in

00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:50,940
doubt power poses in the bathroom always

00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:53,370
work for me when I got frustrated or I

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,300
was losing confidence I would literally

00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:00,839
march to the bathroom like this like

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,990
this and people at work were like what

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,360
is she doing and I'm just like hey it's

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,949
gonna help me so that's fine but some

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:15,899
other power poses look like this or this

00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:17,790
or this or this or this literally

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,480
anything that makes you feel more

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,639
confident or bigger or proud and as you

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,420
can see my voice just got more confident

00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,420
so it works

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:37,160
[Applause]

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:40,310
all right so the next one is better time

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,440
management originally I thought I was

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,570
awesome at time management but in

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:49,190
reality I was barely staying afloat I

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:52,550
honestly thought that I could keep track

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,800
of everything in my head and it turns

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,050
out that actually I was missing due

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,180
dates I was missing appointments I

00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,460
wasn't getting my work done and even

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:04,310
outside of work I was missing like

00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,650
doctor's appointments and friends time

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,140
with friends and it just wasn't working

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,940
but eventually I came across time

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,450
blocking which looks a little bit like

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:17,210
this time blocking can be done on any

00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,460
calendar app out there I personally love

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,130
Google calendars I use it at work and I

00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,200
use it in my personal life so let's say

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,920
you have maybe six things that you need

00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,290
to do during the day time blocking

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,270
blocking time to work on each thing for

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,160
a specific amount of time can help to

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,110
ensure that you get everything done by

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,120
the end of the day if time blocking

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,270
isn't your thing I would strongly

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,980
suggest having a to-do list and at the

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,680
end of the day you can physically cross

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,440
things out and that's one of the most

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,890
satisfying things in the world crossing

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,660
things out and remember like managing

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,260
your time better is one of the keys to

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,970
success so the other thing don't be

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,640
afraid to speak up when something

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:05,080
doesn't feel right

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,080
we're just gonna watch this for a minute

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:17,079
he spoke up he called for his wife so we

00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,579
have to do the same no one deserves to

00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:24,189
be miserable in their job or in general

00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:26,230
and chances are your instincts are right

00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:29,019
if you feel like something is wrong it's

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,480
probably wrong talk to your bosses your

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:33,639
co-workers or anyone on your team that

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,179
you trust let them know what's going on

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,220
even if it's simply you're just feeling

00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:41,889
overwhelmed speak up someone's going to

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,619
help my problem was that I didn't speak

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:47,079
up right away in fact I found out that

00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:49,569
my managers didn't even know that I was

00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:52,239
working on those two big projects they

00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:55,869
thought that I was just failing at my

00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:57,939
job they had no idea but as soon as I

00:11:55,869 --> 00:12:01,600
spoke up and told them what was going on

00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:06,220
things got infinitely better for me so

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,679
learn to say no as a new junior

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,779
developer it's really easy to say yes

00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,959
you want to take all those opportunities

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:17,829
for yourself but sometimes we have to

00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:20,829
say no I said yes a lot and it got me in

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:26,769
a lot of trouble but it's also really

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:31,160
easy to say no so let's let's say no

00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:37,129
together okay so ready one

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:40,550
you three no was that easy it seems like

00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:42,740
that was pretty easy so you know I would

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:47,029
get questions like hey can you send 200

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:49,610
invites out by tomorrow no can you flip

00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:53,629
12 TLS certificates by the end of the

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:55,519
day no it's really easy to say no but as

00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:58,339
much as we want to be able to do

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,709
everything all at once we really can't

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:03,949
and we shouldn't be ashamed to say no

00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:05,600
because really if we say no that means

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,310
that we're actually focusing on

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,850
something that's really important and

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:13,189
that's something that should be praised

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:15,069
so we need to find a success story in

00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:18,019
our company and use it as motivation

00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:20,870
this is Peter he's my manager at News

00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:24,110
cred and he started in November of 2016

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:26,660
as a CSC just like me and he worked

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,939
really really hard and he got his work

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,279
done each and every day he actually was

00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:33,860
one of the only members of the team at

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,579
that time he was managing the entire

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,680
support company and eventually in July

00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:42,050
just eight months later he was named

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,779
head of support and now he runs a team

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:49,130
of six spread out between New York and

00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:52,100
Bangladesh so I use Peter as motivation

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:54,680
every day he's proof that progress is

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,819
possible and that I too can move up the

00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,889
ladder now Peter is the ideal manager he

00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:03,350
sits right next to me and if I need help

00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:05,360
he rolls his chair over and answers my

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,130
questions and it's perfect it's

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,970
everything that I could ever ask for in

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:14,509
a manager the next thing is to set short

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:17,180
and long term goals so short-term goals

00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:19,399
could be for a day a week a month or

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,380
even a year they should help dictate

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,630
what you do in your everyday life it

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,400
should get you closer to your long-term

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,040
goals

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,230
and long-term goals could be for a year

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,140
five years ten years or even a lifetime

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,880
these goals should be career goals life

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,870
or personal goals and should basically

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,240
paint a big picture of your life overall

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,610
my short-term goals are to answer 15

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,740
support tickets a week get at least two

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,840
good ratings a week implement tech

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,080
check-ins and learn JavaScript because

00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,450
I'm really bad at javascript but what

00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,480
detect check-in tech check-ins can be

00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,310
really helpful for junior developers

00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,080
basically what a tech check-in is every

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,300
week with your manager you have a

00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,730
meeting for a set amount of time where

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,410
you go over a specific topic something

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,900
that you're feeling uncomfortable with

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,450
or something that you just don't know at

00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,670
all and you go over that topic and then

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,730
for the next week you implement what you

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:19,010
learned and then the next week you have

00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,890
a new topic and this can really help

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:25,250
boost your confidence and boost that

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,900
relationship with your manager my

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,360
long-term goals are to climb the ladder

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,700
to advance my career and move towards

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,370
technical consulting I'm hoping to do

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,650
that in about six months time eventually

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,990
I'd love to end up as a product manager

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,740
but I know that's somewhere far down the

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,020
line for me

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,940
I also want to have a family and I want

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,940
to be happy just like I think everyone

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:50,450
here wants to be happy so the other

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,250
thing is take care of yourself it's

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,160
really important that we all take care

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:58,010
of ourselves when when the workday is

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,130
over and you're not on call put the

00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,650
computer away and disconnect turn your

00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,320
notifications off especially on weekends

00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,210
and on vacations

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,510
especially on vacations when I see

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,320
people on slack or emailing and they're

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,810
on vacation

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,270
I will actually yell at them because you

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,570
need to be relaxing you have to take

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,310
time to for things that you love and you

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,670
have to treat yourself every now and

00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,910
then

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:28,680
I mean meditate have a spa day hit the

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,810
gym read a book learn something new

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,270
something for yourself that makes you

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:38,010
happy at least once a week if not more

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:40,140
because remember you come first alright

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:43,800
so this is the slide for the senior devs

00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:45,959
and managers so we talked about asking

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,120
for help and advice so you need to

00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,760
listen to your junior devs when they

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,830
asked for advice and you have to advise

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,200
them and offer your knowledge because

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,779
remember you do have more knowledge than

00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,029
them and it's your job to share that

00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,190
knowledge you have to help them to

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:05,100
better manage their time and when you

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,140
give them tasks prioritize them so they

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,890
know what should be done first and then

00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,410
what's not as important when they when

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,290
they express something is wrong listen

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:18,059
and offer help because they're not going

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,010
to come to you with something trivial

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,620
they're gonna come to you when something

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,540
is really really wrong they trust you to

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:28,590
help them so you have to be there for

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:31,950
them and allow your junior devs to say

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,780
no and praise them for doing so because

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,150
they have a lot on their plate they're

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,429
trying to learn everything at once so

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,280
when they do say no that's something to

00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:43,920
be praised be the success story that

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,929
they look up to set that example for

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,380
them so that they can look up to you and

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:51,450
use you as motivation help guide them in

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,160
setting their goals this can be really

00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,080
important because junior Deb's and

00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,050
people who are new to the tech world

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,000
might have no idea what they want to do

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,950
with their lives this is where you come

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,630
in you can give them the options

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,340
different things that they can do with

00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:08,160
their life and different paths that they

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,840
can take to get there and make sure they

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,360
aren't working too hard and they're

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,800
taking care of themselves too if you see

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,620
one of your junior to have super

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,270
stressed out or lagging in their work or

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,460
maybe they are even making themselves

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,860
sick and stressed out tell them to go

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,950
home early let them take a Mental Health

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,840
Day

00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,059
just they have to take care of

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,450
themselves but you to have to take care

00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:34,090
of yourselves so remember that too so

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,360
the other thing that I wanted to do the

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,370
other thing that I wanted to stress was

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,740
is that junior doves

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,139
senior doves and managers all need to

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,909
have good relationships so it's for the

00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:48,669
junior doves out there your higher-ups

00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:50,950
are there to help you they have all the

00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,830
knowledge to share remember they were
