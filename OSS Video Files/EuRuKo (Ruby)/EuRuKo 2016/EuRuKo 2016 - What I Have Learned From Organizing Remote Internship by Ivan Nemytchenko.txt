mulled wine for an after party what's

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:47,899
the story bug so let's welcome him on

00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:54,190
stage and enjoy thank you that's true

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:57,440
and today I'll be talking about my

00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,589
experience of organizing remote

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,379
internship for junior Ruby developers

00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:07,729
this happened a year ago so this is not

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:11,899
related to my working yet lab but in

00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:13,820
develop I spent time I actually

00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:16,280
exploring develop and its possibilities

00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:20,180
and explaining its to other people and I

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,000
spent almost two months exploring

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,219
possibilities of github CI and for now i

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,350
have since there are so many rubies I

00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:30,020
have a question for you please raise

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:36,859
your hands those who are using see I

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:39,979
systems okay thank you it's actually

00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:44,329
hard to understand how when and who is

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:47,179
not using see I so yeah I know that's

00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:51,350
that's a shame to rest Teresa him yeah

00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:54,170
okay nevermind so yeah I'm started I got

00:01:51,350 --> 00:02:01,210
my first paid job as a programmer in

00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:07,270
2002 and I switched to ruby in 2006 and

00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:11,270
in 2008 I my project will got bigger and

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:13,290
I found another guy with the same

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,860
experiences me and we started to work

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:20,790
this project together I had to tell a

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,180
bit about about myself in order to give

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:29,310
you some context about the story first

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:31,680
so later we found two juniors and taught

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,290
them everything we knew and we started

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,400
to work together then later our small

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:44,879
company been merged to to a small

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:48,180
start-up and then one day two guys

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,010
appeared in our office they were

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,200
students and they had to finish some

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,859
project for the university to show and

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,650
they needed some paper that they have

00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:00,959
finished some project in some company so

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,879
we did we gave them some tasks they did

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,519
it and we gave them this paper and they

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,739
disappeared later I quit the startup and

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,280
completely forgot about these two guys

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:16,500
but they appeared again like they they

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,290
graduated from the University and they

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,699
came to me and they said I won we kind

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,560
of love Ruby and we would like you to

00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:28,459
continue teaching us and we want to

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,799
become ruby on rails developers and

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,440
since I was working in startup I've

00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:39,060
learned a bit about how startup work and

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,069
I was thinking I had a lot of ideas and

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,400
I wanted to turn them into startups of

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:46,769
course and I had another idea that it's

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,790
actually a good opportunity for me so

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:54,359
that i will give some of my ideas for

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,549
these guys to implement and and i will

00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,099
teach them how to how to build druga

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,650
ruby on rails applications so two months

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:06,989
later they they built a prototype for me

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:10,530
and I actually gave some i presented my

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:13,259
startup in some mm in some sort of

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,829
meetups obviously i realized that it is

00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,959
not so easy that the code and even a

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:23,610
product is not enough to become a real

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,469
start-up but and later i joined another

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,290
company and these two guys joined this

00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:29,430
company

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:34,330
developers and I was kind of co-founder

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:38,440
later I quit again and I switch it back

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:41,590
to freelancing and then I finally

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:45,100
realized that I've missed a tons of

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:47,740
stuff I that I was writing code in a bad

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,200
way so I was actually writing code in a

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,210
railway and my coat my business logic

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,350
was coupled to the framework logic and

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:59,740
then I real then I started to read lots

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,750
of books and watch a lot of videos from

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,140
conferences about stuff like solid

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,690
principles design patterns refactoring

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:13,090
techniques architecture types and so on

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:15,100
and so on and I realized that such a

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,170
thing exists and I had a couple of

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:21,250
projects where where I was able to apply

00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:24,310
these and I even give a talks like stop

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,140
being rails developer and from way from

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,420
rails way to model our modular

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:33,160
architecture I even created a website

00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:36,760
rails farce calm and there is a first

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,430
lesson for you here like don't be the

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,130
best student in the class because if you

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,110
are the best student like and you don't

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,530
have a mentor who will give you a

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,330
feedback about the stuff you are doing

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:53,860
you will spend a lot of time to become

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:58,720
better in what you are doing and that's

00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:01,050
all with the context and let's let me

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:06,570
tell you actually about the internship

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:10,720
it happened almost exactly a year ago I

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:12,850
I found myself working half time on a

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,950
freelance project and I was thinking I

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,290
was looking for a way to invest the rest

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,500
of my time in something interesting and

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:24,640
potentially useful and of course I had

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:30,910
even more ideas of projects and I

00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:35,840
decided well why can't I find the couple

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:38,520
of guys again and they will do this

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,890
they will implement the prototype from

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:46,500
prototypes for my applications again and

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:50,970
I will teach them so this would this is

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:55,160
what came into my mind so what will in

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:58,260
turn get so basically he will get a

00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,210
project in portfolio you'll get an

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,540
experience of development from idea to

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,330
production he will get the word working

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:09,210
team experience and remote work

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:13,560
experience because I at this moment i

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:15,810
moved to do Serbia but I was going to do

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,450
it in Russian so and the technology

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,750
stacks was pretty simple I wanted to

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:24,530
keep it simple and it looked like this

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,630
and the requirements were also simple

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:31,260
basic ruby on rails and rails knowledge

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:34,950
and ability to contribute at least 20

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:39,090
hours per week so I wrote the blog post

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:43,110
and accidentally become very popular and

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:47,880
in first couple of days I've got 20

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:51,480
applications and then in a week I got

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,270
something like 40 applications and I

00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,600
realized that at first I was excited

00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:01,080
because it looks like this thing become

00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:04,050
popular then I got a bit scared and I

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:08,300
realized that probably I need to choose

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:11,460
the best and I started to think on some

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,340
tests for them in order to reject the

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:19,620
worst tend to to do projects with the

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:24,000
best while I was working on death I've

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:28,200
got about 60 applications and then

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,660
another idea came into my mind well if

00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,300
there is such a big demand maybe I

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,510
should try to turn this internship into

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:40,620
her if not start about something which

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:43,920
could scale then and then I decided to

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,500
turn this test into aptitude test so I

00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,180
was not going to reject anyone if you

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,670
were able to finish

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:55,200
this test you will be you will be able

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:58,140
to work on a project and let me show you

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,920
what how the test actually looked like

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,830
so first first part was really simple so

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,990
you need to create a simple web

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,720
application and there should be a

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,430
registration once registered you should

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,589
be able to see the list of product you

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,560
should be able to create a product and

00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:19,500
you will you should be able to view the

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,839
product that's really simple and most of

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,220
the interns variable to accomplish it in

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,230
a day or two but then whenever someone

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:33,180
reported me that he is completed first

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:36,029
part I sent him the second part and in

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:40,649
the second part there was a new set of

00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:43,050
requirements and the first requirement

00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:47,610
was that now we have three different

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,870
type of users and those three different

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,270
types of users have different

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:56,550
registration forms and different

00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:58,529
validation rules and moreover now we

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,540
have different types of products and

00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:08,640
different permissions according to the

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:11,430
types of users the third part in the

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,800
third part i introduced the ability to

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,450
purchase a product and it was

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,790
implemented through work with external

00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:24,000
API and the the purchase logic was a bit

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,730
complicated so that if you would

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,240
implement it in a very straightforward

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:32,250
way you will end up having like a bunch

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,810
of nested if statements in the

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:40,370
controller action and I was not doing

00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:43,500
any code review between those steps and

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,850
guess what the final result looked like

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:53,220
this and this was done intentionally

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:56,459
because at this point the year old wrote

00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:00,329
the worst code they were able to write

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:04,170
and let me show you a couple

00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:06,029
snippets of this code so this is let me

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:10,019
explain what was my intention while

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:15,989
while I was creating those tasks so my

00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:18,809
intention was to the idea is that there

00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:21,839
is no default rails way to solve their

00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:24,989
problems I was introduced so someone

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,600
would for example for different types of

00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:30,269
users someone could start doing STI

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,269
single table inheritance someone would

00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:37,949
use some gems someone would create

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:41,730
multiple models and so on and so on and

00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:44,069
I well I wanted to make them think I

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,850
wanted them to make decisions that was

00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:49,889
my goal and they made decisions and they

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:53,179
felt the pain from their decisions

00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:57,149
because every business logic pivot

00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:59,009
forced them to think a lot and to feel

00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:01,679
the pain from their decisions because

00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:05,069
they they actually don't know how to

00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:09,720
write code properly so they're doing it

00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:12,209
somehow and this is how this method in

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:17,869
controller looks like in some of the

00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:21,600
projects so and this is not an example

00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:23,519
so common mistakes common problem so

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,610
they tend to ignore all levels of

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,100
abstraction so that low level work with

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:32,009
external PAP I and business logic in one

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:35,790
place is a like very common thing to see

00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:38,850
in this code they tend to use a lot of

00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:42,029
gems because they kind of these gems are

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:45,059
kind of a standard in a community but

00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:48,179
they usually don't know the limitations

00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:52,939
of which these gems i introduced into

00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:56,639
your system and it means they but they

00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:59,879
treat them like it is the only way to do

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:07,009
it like and they treat this limitation

00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:10,110
as a thing with which cannot be changed

00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:12,749
nobody knows almost nobody knows about

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,560
service objects and therefore they tend

00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:16,770
to put business

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,820
logic in pretty random places and spread

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:26,400
it across across whole application and

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:30,750
of course bad naming and after the after

00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,360
this this test there were a couple of

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:37,410
next steps and the first steps whenever

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,570
I should say that they haven't like

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:43,170
finished the helm started this

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,850
internship this test at the one moment

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,550
they were coming they will finish in

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,620
this test in batches and whenever first

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,600
six or seven people have finished that

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:57,960
their test we organized the Hangout call

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,930
and did a code review like we went

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,790
through all the steps of every project

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:09,450
and analyze it every decisions and

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:13,290
describe why those decisions are bad or

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:15,690
good then I read them short lecture

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:19,940
about patterns which can solve the most

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:23,430
of the problem they had then they did a

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,860
refactoring session and then did a cross

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:29,820
code review when they were given the

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:36,000
code of each other and then finally the

00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:38,490
project board have started I have not so

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,680
much to tell about the project part I

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,620
will just demonstrate you the results

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,190
one of the first results one of the

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:52,620
first thing we did is this Ruby or rail

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:55,770
squeeze and it was done really fast by

00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,570
the first team and this thing got very

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:02,370
popular if you haven't seen it you

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:05,670
should try it another thing was and I

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:08,940
really love this idea because it was so

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:11,940
mad because interns were developing the

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,339
platform for internship I real love this

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,790
idea and first thing they implemented is

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:20,700
the task delivery automation whenever

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,730
someone tagged some someone created tag

00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,620
in the repository they received the next

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,630
task automatically and then

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,000
another team created the dashboard so

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:35,200
that I could browse the projects and the

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,500
tags easily the next project was very

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,630
ambitious open source project it's

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:44,710
supposed to be open source alternative

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:47,500
to New Relic I don't think it's finished

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:50,320
but the guys who were working on this

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:56,710
those of our were actually two external

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:58,780
mentors except me and they had very

00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:02,200
pretty challenging task this is why I

00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:05,680
mentioned in them and they were of

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:10,870
course the problems when when I had

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:13,900
almost 16 or something about it interns

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:17,290
who were ready to work on the projects I

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,930
had a problem because I found only these

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,870
two mentors and they had only one

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:26,650
project so they took four of my mentors

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:29,350
and I had to deal with the rest of them

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:32,590
at first I thought I thought this is a

00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:34,870
good idea because when you're like your

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,700
expectations are always like this like

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,680
you will give them direction and they

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,320
will steadily go in this direction and

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,630
then you have three projects your

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,440
expectations all like this so you they

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,540
will steadily go in the direction you're

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:54,730
showing tonight but in reality it was

00:16:49,540 --> 00:17:00,010
more like this because of a bunch of

00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:04,000
problem basically no my mistake was that

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:09,220
I was treating them like it is not a

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:13,660
real project but it was a real project

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:15,220
and you have all the men all the

00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,340
management problems like in the real

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,990
project but they're even like even more

00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,960
these problems I even more aggressive

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:27,640
because the people are you working with

00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:29,440
are less experienced so here are some of

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,830
the problems I had so collectively

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,960
responsibility people like saying that

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:39,270
they will do something but they are not

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,290
doing it sometimes people are just

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:45,240
not able to communicate with each other

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:48,630
in a good way and this was also a

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,960
problem sometimes it is it's a lack of

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:55,740
motivation and as I said the lack of

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:59,610
manners but the the main problem was

00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:02,370
that I realized that in every project I

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:06,560
had to play these three roles I had to

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:10,020
play the role of product owner of

00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,570
project manager and of code mentor and

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:17,760
it was too much for me and of course it

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:20,580
ended up with burnout and these are my

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,400
mistakes so I'm still not sure about it

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,680
whether i should take money from these

00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:31,710
people but i'm still thinking on this

00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:36,360
two big teams I think two for the first

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,430
project is is just enough and I think I

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,650
should have been filtered them I should

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:44,940
have been rejected some people because I

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:48,270
had a lot of problems with just two

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:52,590
people if I would like through for them

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:55,730
it would be much easier for me so things

00:18:52,590 --> 00:19:00,090
that work not so well this project work

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:03,780
but things that work just perfectly this

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:06,630
aptitude test I realized that it was

00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,790
that good because in two months I

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,040
started to receive emails from people

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:15,890
who passed this aptitude test and they

00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:19,710
started to to say hey I one thank you we

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:23,340
realized what you were saying us and we

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:25,320
were able to get a good job now so then

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:32,180
I I realized that it was really good

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:35,610
thing and today today I have a bunch of

00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,860
thoughts on this because a year passed

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:41,640
and of course I was thinking about it

00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:45,900
and I'm thinking maybe I should like try

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,990
it one more time but we'll see so let's

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,600
talk about junior needs junior needs

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,280
first of all he needs a real project to

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,160
work

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:59,190
what what what has been real because if

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,250
you're because the real project gives

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:05,280
you a context and the context mean that

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,500
there is always a business reason why

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,860
something should be done it's not just

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,010
some some fake stuff and it is very

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,290
important because well there is always

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:21,510
as I said there is always a real reason

00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:24,170
why something should be implemented they

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,820
need something they need some something

00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:30,300
some achievement to put in in their

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:33,020
portfolio as I said previously they need

00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,640
whole development cycle experience and

00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,950
they need a team work experience because

00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,690
it is also a problem for many of

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:45,000
developers of of beginner developers and

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,490
how do they learn if they are not like

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,220
in any internship or workshop how do

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:55,590
they learn one way to learn is to go to

00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:58,890
a conference and these gray spot in the

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:01,550
middle it represents your brain your

00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:07,200
current skills and acknowledges and

00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:10,680
those lighter spot's those are new areas

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,980
of knowledge you will learn about like

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,540
in after you visited conference this is

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,960
how your brain will look like we can

00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:21,630
represent it in this way and the bad

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,120
thing here and I like this way of

00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,520
learning a lot I call it exploratory

00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,630
learning you learn about a lot of new

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,610
stuff around you but the problem here is

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,770
that you had to choose you have to

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,790
choose where to put your efforts on and

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:40,290
if you choose for example to become

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:44,010
veteran Alex here and you decide to

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:47,400
spend like next at two weeks to improve

00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:49,530
your alexr skills you will improve it

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,280
and this area of knowledge will become

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:55,830
stronger in your brain but the rest of

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,880
the stuff you will just forget that's

00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:02,100
the trick that's how our brain works and

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,650
so this is why taking notes at the

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,000
conference this actually might help

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:10,840
another way of learning is a book

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,430
reading and online courses this might

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,770
help you to develop a really

00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,470
sophisticated picture of a subject in

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:21,100
your brain like a lot of connected areas

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,540
and related stuff but the problem is

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,240
that this knowledge is not very

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:28,210
practical the problem is that when

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,400
you're maint real problem you will not

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:33,490
be able to apply your knowledge to solve

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,090
this problem quickly so you need to

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:40,330
develop skill skills as well and in

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:45,700
order to develop skills some beginners

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:48,400
do do the pet projects and it works well

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:53,680
so they really develop practical skills

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,670
they know how to use tools but the

00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,930
problem here is that they don't have a

00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:01,390
person who would give them my feedback

00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:04,750
and if you don't have a have a feedback

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:07,390
you don't know your mistakes you don't

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,610
know you don't have a reason to fix

00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,890
those mistakes and you and you just end

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:16,770
up having some delusions in your like

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:22,540
picture in your mind set right and

00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:27,880
another bad thing which a lot of

00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:30,430
beginners think so they think that okay

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,680
I'm graduated now I want to become a

00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:36,490
ruby on rails developer ok I will spend

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:40,860
next six months like reading books

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:44,710
watching online courses and so on and in

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,780
six months I will magically turn turn up

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,330
into a rails developer and I will get a

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:52,150
job and stuff like this but I think in

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:55,090
reality it works a bit differently the

00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:59,110
graph looks like this so first you need

00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:01,600
to learn to do some some something

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:06,010
useful and if you learn how to do at

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:09,670
least something useful it means that for

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:12,310
sure there is a person who will would

00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,590
like it who would like to pay you for

00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:17,320
doing this exactly this kind of tasks

00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:23,440
for example you could learn how to

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:26,080
how to scrub your pages and I that these

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:31,360
this skill is still required for by a

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,889
lot of companies so I know that most of

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,590
the senior developers would consider

00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:38,470
this task really boring but for juniors

00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:43,509
it's just it is it is a very good duck

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:44,980
to to grow and then you get another and

00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:47,289
you make another step and another step

00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,710
and you learn how to become more and

00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:53,799
more useful and this is how you become a

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:56,649
strong developer and another way to

00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:59,470
improve yourself is to contribute to

00:24:56,649 --> 00:25:02,049
open source and see I had to mention

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:05,679
gitlab for example as an example of

00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:09,990
major open source project because in

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:14,049
amateur open source project there is a

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:16,539
set of different problems and you can

00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:19,230
choose the sides size which is right for

00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:21,940
you you can suit you can choose

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:25,029
perfectly sized problem which is not too

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:27,129
boring and not too scary for you another

00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:29,250
good thing about mature open source

00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:33,159
project is that there is a community and

00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:35,470
the community means feedback and as we

00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:38,470
said previously feedback is crucial to

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:45,580
your growth okay let's talk about

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:50,110
seniors yeah and seniors they have lots

00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:51,850
of tasks they are very busy so and of

00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,190
course they have a lot of important

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,200
stuff to do but they also have lots of

00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,440
routine tasks they have a lot of

00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,950
research tasks they have a lot of nice

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:07,090
to have features to work on they have

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,919
lots of flow priority features and they

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,809
have missing features in their favorite

00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,519
open source project but obviously they

00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:15,220
don't have time to contribute to these

00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:20,429
projects and of course they have tons of

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:24,039
ideas for their side projects hmm it

00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:27,279
looks like they have exactly this kind

00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:30,240
of tasks which are required by these

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,429
juniors right so why can't we

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,760
take these juniors and start giving them

00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:42,750
than these tasks well you don't want to

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:45,720
to deal with just any junior with any

00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:49,110
beginner you would like them to have the

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,450
same mindset as you have and you would

00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:54,090
like them to look like this so they

00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,630
ideally did they should share the

00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,910
mindset you have ideal situation would

00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:03,270
look like this like you would like just

00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:06,300
to clone yourself right but since it's

00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:09,210
not yet possible we had to like find a

00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:16,260
workaround and let's take this mindset

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:20,010
and see where where it comes from so

00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:23,100
this small piece of of your mindset I

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:26,309
know that it came from from one up

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:30,020
on one project like you you did

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:33,270
something you you made some decision and

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,460
well you basically erased half of the

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:37,860
database in production maybe not the

00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,429
health but you learn it you've learned

00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,920
from this mistake right then was another

00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:48,050
it was another project and you wrote

00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:52,500
very inefficient query and like and

00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:55,080
simple operation they took like half an

00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,240
hour in your in the website so and

00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,520
you've learned this lesson as well and

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,820
there were more and more projects like

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,370
this and you and and you've learned and

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:09,000
this is how you got this picture this is

00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:11,610
how you go to your mindset and this also

00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,470
can be represented as a path like you

00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:17,630
went for a couple of projects and you

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,630
learn some lessons in these projects and

00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:28,350
what I'm suggesting is to like split

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:30,650
those is to turn these turn your

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:34,080
experience from these projects into

00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:36,570
exactly same set of tasks which I was

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,270
describing which I was given in the in

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,940
this internship like this you can

00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:45,980
represent your experience as a set of

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:49,860
tasks which which is also a set of

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:53,100
business requirements pivots so you can

00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:57,050
turn the first experience in this set of

00:28:53,100 --> 00:29:02,150
task in the second one and the third one

00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:06,690
this is of course just a hypothesis but

00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:08,940
for now I have like a huge pile of tasks

00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:13,650
like this i would like to delegate them

00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:15,870
and those will be very useful if someone

00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,910
would work on this on them it will be

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:23,340
you it will be very useful for my

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:29,340
company and the solution the solutions

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:34,440
will take a lot of attention and now if

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:36,630
I ever decide to do it again what I will

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:42,030
change first of all I will develop more

00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:45,360
tests so I have I would develop tests

00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:47,820
for like for myself I already have an

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,330
idea of a test for our spec for work

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:55,260
with external IP api's and work with the

00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:58,679
CI and I will be calling not only for

00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:01,620
interns but also for mentors and I'm

00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:05,820
going to help these mentors to turn

00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:10,020
their experience into the same into the

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:13,890
tasks like this and of course I'm going

00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:17,160
to reject the bad nudist because

00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:22,500
sometimes there are people which are

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:25,890
just not worth your time I think that's

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:30,780
it for me like I still have those

00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:35,340
stickers so please come and ask ask me

00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:38,929
for them i would like to like to talk to

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:42,200
those who are somehow related to

00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:49,760
teaching to dealing with newbies to

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:49,760
teaching newbies so that's it thank you

00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,970
Thank You gun

00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,810
