please take a seat thank you very much

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:17,670
so our next speaker grace chang she's an

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,580
engineer at Yammer London she is also

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,400
the on call tech lead as far as I

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,740
understood she likes reliable sites

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,890
continues development and I was told

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:35,660
also gifts food and gives a food is it

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,660
correct ok so here she is for you enjoy

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:45,270
thank you uh hello thank you again and I

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,890
apologize ahead of time to all the

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:54,210
bulgarians here if I mess this up but

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,300
I've 8th day I think yeah i'm told that

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,600
means hello if it means a curse word I

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:03,270
apologize profusely and I blame all the

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,850
organizers now they're cool people so

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,619
yes my name is Grace and currently i

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,060
work at Yammer London but as you can

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,240
probably tell from my accent I'm

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,240
originally from Vancouver Canada I just

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,329
moved to London last year but I have

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,920
been doing on call with Yammer for

00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:22,079
several years now and that's what I'm

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,420
here to talk about with you today in

00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,999
case you're not familiar Yammer is a

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,990
social network for enterprise we were

00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:33,889
acquired several years ago by Microsoft

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,240
so it's a large platform a lot of users

00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:40,380
but we're obviously trying to grow every

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,389
day um and I also apologize very

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,479
profusely both to the internet because

00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:48,569
while I am talking about cats I am

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,139
personally a dog person and I actually

00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:55,950
don't have any gifts in my slides but I

00:01:52,139 --> 00:02:01,469
have hand-drawn pictures and hopefully

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,600
that will be just as good as gifs so I'm

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,219
going to talk about hurting cats and if

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,310
this is enough phrase that people are

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,979
not familiar with it's kind of a phrase

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,650
that we use to talk about trying to

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,849
gather people to do something but it's

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,410
really difficult because all these

00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,580
people are trying to do

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,250
different things or they're just not

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,750
cooperating with you and it is one of

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,770
the hardest things you can possibly do

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:30,510
and why specifically cats I can give a

00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:33,310
story that one of my friends told me he

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,650
used to play a game when he was in uni

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,320
with his roommates cats I think at least

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,870
two of them maybe more he would take a

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,000
laser pointer and try and get one of the

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,370
cats to follow the laser pointer into a

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,290
bookshelf and then while that cat is

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,210
still inside the bookshelf he would try

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,340
and get the other cat into the same

00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,440
bookshelf obviously that doesn't work

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,270
out with one laser pointer because first

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,920
cat starts coming out the other cat goes

00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:02,320
in it's a kind of a hard task but this

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,080
story isn't about impossibilities it's

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,690
about being able to train teams and help

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,680
them learn new tricks we're dealing with

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:15,310
difficult things so let me rewind a

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:21,130
little bit first all the way back to the

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:26,530
year 1 BC or before cats so in the

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:30,310
beginning there was only darkness but

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:35,230
suddenly out of the darkness there came

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:38,050
a sound I apologize there's no speaker

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:41,920
setup so imagine pedra noises go in here

00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:44,170
it's mostly for effect anyways so when i

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,450
started at yammer we didn't really have

00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,700
concept of alcohol I'd heard lots of

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,840
stories about other teams at other

00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,739
organizations having on call teams and

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,480
obviously it's not a pretty terrible

00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,480
they would have to carry pagers or

00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,520
mobile phones and modern days with them

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,150
at all times just in case something went

00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:07,000
wrong with the production environment

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:10,720
actually Yammer did have an on-call sort

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,280
of it was one person who was on call all

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:22,000
day and every night of every day of

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:25,210
every week for all of eternity not quite

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,430
but close enough everyone was around to

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,800
help of course anybody else on the

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,419
engineering team but eventually this

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,639
team grew so large and the entire

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:35,349
environment was so unwieldy that it was

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,190
unreasonable for one person to be

00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:41,680
responsible for everything and we knew

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,800
that deep inside just nobody wanted to

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,389
be the first one to say it but why not

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,789
why didn't we want to help this poor

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,960
soul who had the entire world of Yammer

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:56,280
on his shoulders well one of our leading

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,720
people said and I highly paraphrase here

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,479
we don't need no stinking on-call

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,009
rotation our project is so good it

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,469
doesn't need a whole team to keep it

00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:12,310
running in fact that would be a waste of

00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:14,680
their time I call on this so

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:19,240
eventually as one would predict disaster

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,919
happens it was a Friday or for some of

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,379
us still Thursday because we hadn't

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,300
really slept much the night before and a

00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:28,120
massive production issue occurred for

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,389
some reason or another and a handful of

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,919
either dedicated or insomniac engineers

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,639
we're struggling to keep things from

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:39,279
falling apart eventually we had to call

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,740
for help and I was the one who had to

00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:46,000
make this call and it's rough this is

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:48,279
roughly how it went mmm hi sorry to be

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,009
calling at this hour I'm from Yammer and

00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,949
I work with engineers name can I please

00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:56,440
speak with him again this is three in

00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:58,060
the clock in the morning this guy had

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,129
just gotten back from his honeymoon and

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,669
I was in his wife answered the phone

00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:08,770
basically it was as awkward as it sounds

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:10,690
and eventually he woke up probably tried

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,960
to get some coffee and stuff and helped

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,610
us out and eventually after several

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,199
hours we finally managed to get our

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,810
production environment back into a

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,150
stable state but it was at this point

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,629
more or less that we decided we can't

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,520
keep doing this this guy needs to sleep

00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:31,650
so the decree was made we would have an

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,650
on-call team ray problem solved right

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:39,699
easier said than done like many things

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:42,440
so let me go back to a little forward in

00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:45,720
time to the year 180 after disaster

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,509
the first difficulty of what we had come

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,930
across while just putting this on call

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:55,020
team together was how do we do math at

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:58,979
the time give we decided that we would

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:02,550
have just for engineers or cats to be

00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:04,770
the guinea pigs give me guinea cats to

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,500
iron out the entire process before we

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:10,050
rolled it out to the entire team out of

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,419
one of the out of these four one was the

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,509
cat herder or the tech lead and that was

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:17,669
my role at this time we also had one

00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:21,060
monolithic application written and rails

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:22,440
with about 15 ish services which were

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,069
written in Java so that was two

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,319
different stacks and we tried to figure

00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:30,599
out best how to organize and split the

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,180
responsibilities uh in such a way that

00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:37,440
it didn't make everybody's lives suck

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:41,909
and it's not easy it kind of ended up

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,750
with just for sad cats this is an actual

00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:47,279
photo of my notebooks when we when I was

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,169
trying to figure out how to do our

00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,169
scheduling so it really didn't suck for

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:55,529
everyone but all the options sucked

00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:58,229
really he and another big challenge of

00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:00,029
for us was having to get used to all

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:02,039
these acronyms that started cropping up

00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:09,539
all around us and we couldn't avoid them

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:12,000
things like MTBF mttr aar SLA and they

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:15,029
became bigger and bigger not obviously

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,219
the acronyms themselves so I'll go

00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,509
quickly over some of the meanings of the

00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:21,000
the meanings of some of these acronyms

00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:24,539
that were key to us the first one is

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,289
MTBF mean time between failures this is

00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:31,159
basically how long is it roughly between

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:33,949
outages of your application or sites

00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:37,680
whatever you may whatever it may be

00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:40,110
meantime to recovery is related to this

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,930
but it is actually how long it takes for

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:47,579
you to get from that unstable state back

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:50,250
to a healthy state SLA most important

00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:52,680
thing also called availability in some

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,960
areas service level agreement this is

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,420
basically the contract between your

00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,510
business and your users so you're saying

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,210
to your users we will promise that our

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,930
site or application or service will be

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:09,360
available to you this percentage out of

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,640
the month it's pretty important because

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,260
obviously more downtime means fewer

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:18,240
users they are after action review this

00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,490
one came up and I actually had to look

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,230
this up again because it's kind of an

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:27,840
older one basically is pretty self

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,190
self-descriptive it is what you do with

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,010
the documents that you have to write up

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,900
after the whole shindig has gone down

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,990
and you have to kind of explain what

00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,850
happened also related to that is I our

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,770
incident report this is actually the

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,170
term that we like to use more just

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:48,480
because it's a little well it's shorter

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:50,340
slightly but yeah there was like so many

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,040
acronyms and it was just so overwhelming

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,470
to us so we started to break it down and

00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,300
I'll break it down here too but this is

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:02,280
very rough um going back to MTBF mean

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,160
time between failures and meantime two

00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,080
recoveries I'll try hard I tell them

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,740
I'll try my best not to use the acronyms

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,110
themselves and use the full terms here

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:16,560
anyways so between these two what

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:19,140
mattered the most to us but really it's

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,830
not a matter of what's more important

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,680
it's how do you balance them out and how

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:28,050
do you improve on one while the other

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,610
while not making sure over all your

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,180
systems are still healthy that your

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,910
availability is still up it's kind of

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,700
like if going back to the cat analogies

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,260
mean time between failures is like how

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,360
often does your cat vomit on the rug

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,270
mean time for recovery is how fast can

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,530
you clean it up when it does and

00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,230
obviously there were various things that

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:52,020
we have to consider a the rough business

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,660
impact of each which is the ones in grey

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,780
so mean time between failures obviously

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,700
less frequent mean time to recovery when

00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,250
you focus on that you obviously have

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,900
faster recovery so it's much better even

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:08,610
if you're down it's only for a few

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:10,800
minutes at most in blue is what we need

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,860
to do to achieve either of these goals

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,019
for mean time between failures required

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,820
more stable systems it depends obviously

00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,130
on the current state of your system

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,750
whether that's something reasonable at

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,120
that time or it's something that you

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:27,209
need to do more incrementally mean time

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,950
to recovery also needed some time so

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:31,019
that your engineers could be trained to

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,510
respond well to any of these incidents

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:37,140
so that they can act fast to anything

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:40,170
that comes up the benefits of these two

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,660
in green for mean time between failures

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,779
it meant that engineers were interrupted

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,850
less frequently you know your cat vomits

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,649
less frequently good that's less for you

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,170
to clean up or less frequently that you

00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:54,420
have to clean up after it while mean

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,339
times our recovery engineers gain a

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,220
broader knowledge over the entire system

00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,899
just because they have to handle all of

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,230
these incidents but at least they'll

00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:07,620
know how to do that fast and of course

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:10,680
the negatives for these for mean time

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,089
between failures possibly they could be

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,350
more disastrous it's kind of like

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:18,500
instead of smaller breaks or outages you

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:22,310
might possibly have kind of a big bang

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,800
outage that lasts for several minutes or

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,660
god forbid hours while mean time to

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,720
recovery we don't have we might not have

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,910
that but it could also mean that you are

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,160
facing more frequent issues you know how

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,050
to respond to them quickly but they come

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,040
up more often so maybe that's how you

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:43,529
get used to responding to them so this

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,019
is I swear this is the only formula in

00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,380
my slides and it's not really even a

00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,790
formula really but this is kind of the

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,949
official definition of the relationship

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,790
between mean time between failure and

00:12:52,949 --> 00:13:01,320
meantime to recovery and of course our

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:03,660
over looming SLA or availability so

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,149
neither these really are dependent on

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,060
each other necessarily but obviously the

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:11,250
SLA does depend on both of them but it's

00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,279
not a scale where you have to have

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,649
either one on opposite ends it's more

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:20,040
like a range for either one of them so

00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:21,730
as one goes up you don't have to go up

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,550
on the other one

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,870
in fact it could go down temporarily

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,399
then when you're happy with that one and

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:30,430
it doesn't have to be a hundred percent

00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,070
for example in the mean time between

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,260
failures here you can go and push the

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,120
other one the second one up and then

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,250
whatever you do though obviously you

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,720
just need to make sure that you stick to

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,550
the important thing on the left hand

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,040
side of the equation the availability

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:50,199
and this is obviously the goal that you

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,899
want in the end so we settled on our

00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:56,889
goals now we had to kind of track all

00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:59,410
these things the AAA RS or IRS that as

00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,709
we are using now we considered using

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,940
google doc forms at the very beginning

00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,620
there obviously there are many tools

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,680
that we consider so I'm only listing a

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,870
the key ones that we actually try it out

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,959
this one ended up being kind of hard to

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:16,449
read the reports if you're not familiar

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,940
with the way that Google Forms does it

00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:20,980
basically spits out the responses as a

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,779
spreadsheet and it kind of when you're

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,959
trying to read prose it makes it really

00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:30,130
difficult to do that there was also

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:32,740
Yammer notes we have basically a rich

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:36,190
text editing in Yammer the product as

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,290
well and the good thing was about this

00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,940
was that you can link it to different

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,209
threads or conversations that are

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,649
happening about the specific incidents

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:47,019
however they were very hard to analyze

00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:49,449
you can link them to threads but there's

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:52,000
not very good way of searching querying

00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:55,720
for these for these notes inside of

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,470
Yammer lastly we had JIRA which we were

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,980
already using as a bug tracking bug

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:09,910
tracking tool and it wasn't perfect but

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:12,130
it sort of worked in the ends there was

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,319
lots of different fields as you can see

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,730
and from another photo of some of the

00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:18,399
notes that i was taking at the time to

00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,889
try and see how we can actually build an

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,990
incident report form that would make

00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:25,089
sense to engineers that would be simple

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,029
for them to fill out but also not lose

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:29,410
track of all the important things there

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:31,420
are a lot of details that we considered

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,690
important at first we don't have all of

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,390
these fields anymore

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,220
as so as we went along obviously some of

00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,690
them naturally stopped being filled out

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,330
we determined obviously oh there's

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,700
probably not as important they've become

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:47,230
optional now but the key ones are

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:50,270
obviously still there and we've now been

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,830
using JIRA for about three years and

00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,910
it's been serving us quite well and

00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:57,650
obviously has many benefits including a

00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:00,260
tag track or label tracking you can do

00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:06,530
queries against them so this is what we

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:08,300
settled on using and all of this took

00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,370
place over several months and we figured

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:17,720
hey we're starting to get the hang of

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:23,330
this maybe not yet we weren't where we

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:25,820
want it to be at the time at this point

00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,890
in time the way that we did projects it

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,230
made it such that whenever we created a

00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,550
new service in our micro system our co

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,100
service service oriented architecture

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,590
worlds we would kind of dump them into

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,720
the pool with all the others so this

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,000
meant that the number of services grew

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,630
faster than the engineers who maintained

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,660
them and it also meant possibly more

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,910
technologies which meant more toys for

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,450
cats to play with it means that they get

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:55,340
distracted easily as well at this for

00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,850
example at this time we had about four

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,610
different data stores on top of the

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:04,130
rails and Java applications that we had

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,290
so imagine taking like a bunch of yarn

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,990
balls tossing it on the ground and then

00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,000
letting loose a bunch of cats it's kind

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,560
of a disaster hurting them to actually

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,790
you know get them to do whatever you

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:21,620
want to so despite this we also rotated

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,600
projects and people who worked on

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,060
different projects because we wanted to

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,140
prevent expertise or we wanted to

00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:35,000
prevent silos from fear from forming as

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:36,440
some people refer to them as but with

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,990
all these cats playing with different

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,050
balls unfortunately one cat may play

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,700
might play with just one ball so silos

00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,980
for me even though you didn't want them

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,320
to some people just actually get more

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,720
used to a certain service than another

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,510
person it just happens it's not

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,639
something that is easily avoidable on

00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:58,370
top of this a side effect is that you

00:17:55,639 --> 00:18:02,000
get no clarity on who's responsible for

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,649
what so you know after all the cats are

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,289
done playing and they kind of saunt her

00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,700
off to do whatever their own thing is

00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:09,830
they kind of leave all the yarn balls

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:15,080
for someone else to deal with probably

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:17,389
you and most importantly burnouts

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,070
burnout basically I'm sure many people

00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:21,889
feel it on their normal day-to-day but

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:24,230
imagine also having to have the

00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:27,049
responsibility of carrying your phone

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:30,200
around our lap or even laptop in the

00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:33,260
evenings in the app on the weekends it's

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,409
very stressful and the responsibility

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,269
level is much higher than usual so that

00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:39,740
was another thing that was problematic

00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:44,149
and we didn't really have a solution for

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:47,029
that yet so several months of this

00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:50,000
continued on we kept making small tweaks

00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:51,740
here and there and eventually we got to

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,010
a point where we decided all these

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:59,480
initial efforts were kind of good enough

00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:01,309
to roll out to the entire team so we

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,580
thought there were plenty of adjustments

00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:07,309
that we obviously had to make one of

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:11,840
those is that we decided to do was do

00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:15,470
more by doing less as I mentioned we had

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,080
two different stacks rails and rails in

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,659
java / drop wizard and that was the

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,649
easiest way to draw the line between

00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:24,590
responsibilities so we had some people

00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:29,029
being on call for rails while others

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:30,860
were on call for java so we decided to

00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:32,750
go with that it meant that you as a

00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,929
person we're probably dealing with less

00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:38,539
at any given point in time on top of

00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:40,250
that we added in our London office when

00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:42,580
all this to all of this was taking place

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,620
it was only in this San Francisco office

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,720
we also added the London office with

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,029
shorter rotations but it meant that

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,679
people in San Francisco could finally

00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:54,649
sleep at night they don't have to go on

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,600
from 9am to nine a.m. the next day

00:19:54,649 --> 00:20:00,620
basically 24 hours

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:03,470
and it also meant that with more people

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,080
joining the processing the team of being

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,610
on call it meant that we they gained

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,190
more knowledge but we had to onboard

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,660
them to this process we had to help them

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:17,630
gain that knowledge because it's a lot

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:20,480
to digest all at once so to make sure we

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:23,420
train people and had them both be both

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,870
open to helping anybody in an area that

00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,520
they were from more most familiar with

00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:31,250
they also had to be okay obviously with

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,100
asking somebody more knowledgeable about

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:38,930
some other area that might not be their

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:41,330
Forte overall this is the hardest part

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:45,170
convincing people to do on call

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:47,210
especially with engineers going back to

00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:51,020
the park the cat's story in the book

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:53,480
case is basically that but it is

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,640
possible to get the whole team on board

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,770
you just have to be persuasive about it

00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,040
and convincing and I'll touch on that a

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:04,970
little bit later once this was all done

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,670
we also made sure to practice everything

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:12,020
so we did drills we did tabletop

00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:14,060
exercises we did breakdowns just

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:20,630
practice goes with almost anything else

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:23,240
in life so now that all hands were on

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,550
deck we had to also make some more

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,670
adjustments to the overall process and

00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,610
the system and tooling the first change

00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:35,260
we did was move all of the alerts into a

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:37,460
configuration repo this meant that we

00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,650
since they were in source control and

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,200
made it clear what the history of each

00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,990
alert was it was also easier to maintain

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,060
so any changes that can be made you just

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:51,590
had to change the configuration push it

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:53,990
out and the alert was changed another

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,970
thing we did was since engineers were

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:59,450
busy doing their thing and managers

00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:01,480
weren't doing too much else make them

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,610
incident managers make them do something

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,070
so it was the role of the managers or

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,330
the incident managers to do all the

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,429
documentation

00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,049
as the in starting the incident reports

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,539
and making sure that all the details

00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:18,769
were properly filled out or correctly

00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:21,140
filled out they also coordinated all the

00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:23,929
necessary engineers for any issues again

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,210
going back to some people having more

00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:27,769
expertise in certain areas if they were

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,289
kind of struggling with something the

00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:32,269
incident manager would be able to pull

00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:34,490
in someone else by calling them or

00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:36,200
messaging them texting them sending

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,590
carrier pigeons I don't know however you

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,289
want to get people pulled in most

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:46,039
importantly though they did the external

00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:48,380
communications with the other teams at

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,120
at our company that had to tell the

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,510
customers the bad news is that we are

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,820
having issues I can imagine I myself

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,370
obviously would not want to be the one

00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,049
telling our users hey sorry our sites

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,809
kind of down you're gonna have to wait

00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:06,139
for a little bit to use it it's imagine

00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:09,860
it's just like having to tell a cat not

00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:11,450
to or to hang out with this specific

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,919
person it's going to have a mind of its

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:18,710
own it's going to go under off and do

00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:21,080
something else we also did run books for

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,389
all of these different services that we

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,059
had originally we of course did have

00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:28,130
some form of read me or run book for

00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,630
with each service but the most important

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:34,070
thing about the run books that we had

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:36,500
was that we made them very in-depth with

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:39,620
regard to the alerts that were tied to

00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,510
the service this is especially important

00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,630
for the meantime to recovery because it

00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:47,360
means if there are clearer steps for

00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,690
resolution all you have to do is just go

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,220
I got this alert follow steps one two

00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:56,870
and three and hopefully it should be

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:59,210
resolved by then this also obviously

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:02,809
meant that the initial response was as

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,309
simple as possible we assumed anybody

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,350
should be able to do this even if you

00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:13,789
have as little knowledge about a certain

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:17,090
system as I don't know your cat but even

00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:19,669
with all this we decided also we can't

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:22,460
keep doing this these people still need

00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:25,169
to do work outside of this

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,929
so this continued for a while and we

00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:29,730
slowly began to hit our stride but we

00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:31,379
obviously continue making adjustments as

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:34,799
we discovered parts of the process that

00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:38,190
just didn't really work out for us and

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:41,239
so my story comes back up to speed with

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:44,159
the present and you might be thinking

00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:47,340
we've done all these things what's left

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,669
the fix well like any real problem

00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:53,399
person wise or code wise there's no

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:56,609
actual end to what things that you can

00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:59,249
improve on so these are some of the

00:24:56,609 --> 00:25:02,159
things now that we are focusing on the

00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:03,570
first being combined schedules and keep

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,789
in mind the things that I'm talking

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:09,869
about now are still in flux we're doing

00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:14,570
them now so take them with a grain of

00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:17,850
salt so combining the two schedules I

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,739
mentioned previously that we had decided

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,980
actively not to do this at the beginning

00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:27,450
and we split by stacks so we had rails

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:31,289
in Java now we had basically a single

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:34,230
unified team who just worked on services

00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:36,629
so we decided that they should be

00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:40,950
responsible for all the services

00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:45,480
regardless of stack it probably was

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:48,359
crazy it sounds crazy probably is but we

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,999
did this knowing that it meant that

00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:53,700
people would end up being on-call less

00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:55,440
often it might be a shitty week for them

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,440
but at least that shitty week will only

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,109
have to have to happen maybe once every

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,960
nine to 18 weeks depending on obviously

00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:05,609
how many people were in the team and

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,019
this was very critical obviously for

00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:11,190
burnout we didn't want people feeling

00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:13,289
tired or stressed so doing it less

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,539
frequently at least they could prepare

00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:18,539
ahead of time as well they can kind of

00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:23,669
recoup in the time off and get some

00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:27,090
actually work done to this also came out

00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:28,950
of the so this wasn't the only decision

00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,779
behind us though it came out so out of

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,480
the fact that since these teams are

00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:36,970
unified the schedule should be too so

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,160
this is kind of important based on the

00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,750
fact that we believe that the engineer

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,059
should be able to handle all issues

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:47,620
regardless of their primary programming

00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:50,650
language we also have started doing post

00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:53,320
mortems and retrospectives it's

00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,240
basically learning from our mistakes and

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,340
the problems that we had it's good

00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,070
practice for any part of life anyway so

00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:02,620
we applied it here on top of the

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:05,590
incident reports we started doing post

00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,210
mortems and retro sorry we started doing

00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,419
these post mortems and retrospectives

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:12,160
and we try to do them almost immediately

00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:14,350
after the incident so it's fresh in our

00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,450
minds obviously if it happens at the end

00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,160
of the day then we postpone it until the

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,500
next day but if it happens in the

00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,150
morning and it's resolved we try and do

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,330
it in the afternoon so that you don't

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:30,090
forget any details when we do them we

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:34,090
focus on few on just a few key questions

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:36,669
the what basically the timeline what

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,590
happened in what order this is helping

00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:40,570
us to figure out what exactly happened

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,450
and getting into the root cause of the

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,830
problem the where which geographical

00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,140
area since I mentioned that there was

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,790
san francisco and london but sometimes

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,190
things go under the radar something

00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:53,620
happens in one time zone that overflows

00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:56,770
into the other so that's also important

00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,780
to know so that we know whether there

00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:02,460
were any things that we could have done

00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:04,660
to prevent this from happening also as

00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,270
obviously as the product is used by

00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,890
customers from all over the world only

00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,360
some regions might be affected by

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,830
certain problems too that's also

00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,210
important because we figure out whether

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:18,940
you know only asia-pacific was affected

00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:23,080
was it only North America it cut it kind

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,309
of cuts down on our overall slrs overall

00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,270
service level agreement with our

00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:30,610
customers the Y basic going back from

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,740
the what's kind of dives into what the

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,299
actual root cause was this might not

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,700
necessarily come up in the

00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:38,500
retrospectives immediately it might take

00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,530
a little bit more investigation but we

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,540
at least make sure that we have tickets

00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,970
or something and we have people assigned

00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:48,820
to figure out what exactly went wrong

00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,230
and obviously that leads into the how of

00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,570
how can we prevent this from happening

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:56,710
again in the future which is the most

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:58,990
important part actually the most

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,690
important thing is that we do not make

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,890
this a blame game it's not just because

00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,440
we don't want to point fingers at

00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:08,170
anybody but also it's such a massive

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,630
system and a small change here can beam

00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:12,940
disaster over there it's a mistake that

00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,890
anybody can make and we don't want to

00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:18,700
put all the pressure on to just one

00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:21,340
person its collective ownership of our

00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:25,900
problems and collective ownership of the

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:28,090
efforts to fix them we also have started

00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:31,360
doing weekly handovers and monthly

00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,550
reviews the weekly handovers happen

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,940
first thing Monday morning in both the

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:38,590
US and the UK basically all the

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,300
engineers who had been on call the

00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:42,580
previous week get into a room with the

00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,670
engineers who are coming on call the

00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,380
current week and they do a handover they

00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:49,900
say what were the problems that they

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,550
noticed during their during their stint

00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,920
the previous week are there any

00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,750
lingering issues are there any current

00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:00,820
ongoing issues that might come up during

00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:03,160
this week's this week's oncol stint we

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,560
also make note of all of the top alerts

00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,450
and what we had to do to resolve them

00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,690
and we have a fancy spreadsheet you

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,930
don't won't show on here its pivot

00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,550
tables in excel it's pretty boring but

00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:17,440
we keep track of this so that we know

00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,680
what are the things that we need to pay

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,080
attention to the most which services are

00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:26,380
the most noisy or active like or

00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,210
problematic also if any run books were

00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,400
missing for these services we need to

00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:35,470
make note of that and get that fixed as

00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:38,050
soon as possible also going so again

00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:42,070
going into the focusing on the noisiest

00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:45,490
of these services also because time

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:47,760
zones are really hard I have also had a

00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,320
time zone snafu coming here anyways um

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,690
time zones are hard it's really hard to

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,340
do the math in your head with you know

00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,770
calculating okay so London is eight

00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,100
hours ahead of San Francisco but there's

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,490
also daylight saving

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:05,120
as a daily or is it summer or winter it

00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:06,830
can be a nightmare so we only had the

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,799
on-call tech leads in each of the

00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:13,190
offices doing the handover between the

00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:15,530
UK and us this frees up the actual

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,179
engineers from having to stay late or

00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:20,270
having to wake up early in the mornings

00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:21,559
for these handover meetings and it saves

00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,110
us a little bit of coordination because

00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,330
there's only one or two people in charge

00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:28,940
of making sure that all the important

00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:32,480
things are communicated across the

00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,580
geographies and it also obviously means

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,760
that you don't have to again not

00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:40,909
everyone has to go to either 6pm 7pm

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:45,650
meetings in London or I don't know 8am

00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:47,360
meetings in San Francisco aside from the

00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:49,730
reviews in London we've also started

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,679
doing started a site effort to make sure

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,140
that the engineers are actually feeling

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,140
like their time on call is doing more

00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:00,679
good than not so we started doing these

00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:02,690
surveys they are completely optional but

00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,150
the engineers coming off call were

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:08,470
recommended to fill out the survey which

00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:11,630
had the same questions every single time

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:14,390
we basically asked about their mood

00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:18,230
before going before and after going on

00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:20,900
call just to make sure that they're

00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:23,150
actually feeling pretty prepared for

00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,370
whatever is meant to come up to them or

00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,919
you know maybe they had a really shitty

00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,900
week and they just felt like completely

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:34,669
exhausted by the end it's also important

00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:36,409
to note that to burn out we also had to

00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:39,650
make sure that we're actually improving

00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:42,080
so we asked things about did you feel

00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:44,809
like you were prepared were all the

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,600
proper run books available to you was

00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:50,030
your we have primary and secondary so

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,059
was the opposite person available when

00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:55,490
you needed them did your schedules work

00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:57,320
out ok were they available to cover you

00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,600
when you're commuting all these

00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:05,030
basically more of the personal stuff

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,710
rather than the technical aspects and we

00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,840
of course overall just wanted to make

00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,240
sure that nobody felt burned out at the

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,580
end and we wanted to make sure that they

00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,030
fell

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,710
heard their opinions matter too we

00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:19,050
didn't want anyone feeling like they

00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:23,160
were overwhelmed or on their own while

00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:27,450
they were on call but of course the

00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:29,550
biggest and worst problem of all is the

00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:34,680
fact that we just have so many alerts

00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:36,810
still we need to fix them all and in

00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,640
order to do that we started to try and

00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:41,490
break them down into bigger categories

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,850
of alerts so that we can obviously use

00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:47,880
different processes to fix them first on

00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:50,700
the chopping chopping block or her the

00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,010
noisy ones that are probably configured

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,040
wrong or something so if there was a

00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:58,530
threshold that could be bumped just bump

00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,410
it if it's not even alert that you need

00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:05,190
why do we even have it just delete that

00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:07,290
 flaky alerts are a little bit

00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:10,170
harder than this it could possibly

00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:12,750
resolve before you could even have a

00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:15,720
chance to go and look at it graphs could

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,190
be spiky but you don't know why and then

00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,210
of course there are also people working

00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:23,820
on projects that you know the service is

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:26,880
kind of falls under maybe they didn't

00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:30,690
tell you about it which is also bad but

00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:33,060
maybe they could also look at it too of

00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,460
course if it's an actual really bad

00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:41,160
problem we have to spend more time to

00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:46,050
dig into it sorry going back also to the

00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:48,570
flaky alerts we have we don't have this

00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:51,000
yet but we hope to eventually have an

00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:54,140
initial line of automated defense where

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,720
our monitoring systems can trigger a

00:34:54,140 --> 00:35:01,020
scripts that try to auto repair when an

00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,600
alert triggers if this fails then we can

00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,390
alert actually to the on-call engineer

00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,900
at least but by the time that a human

00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:12,720
looks at it we've tried at some comet

00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,340
we've tried all the common responses to

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:19,770
this type of alert especially if it's an

00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:22,320
alert that happens frequently all this

00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,910
probably sounds completely insane and

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,510
we're probably still really far from

00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,180
where we want

00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,730
to be but you know what we come a long

00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:32,400
way and at least we've seen enough to

00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:35,790
know better what path we need to take to

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,190
actually get to our end goal hell before

00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:43,830
we didn't even have an end goal but now

00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:47,010
we do and for us what that means is we

00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:50,580
want to get to a point where eventually

00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:53,310
we want to have only one alert per

00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,400
person per day so that's maximum

00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:59,400
absolute maximum of seven alerts per

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,350
week we are still quite far of that but

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,540
far from that but at least it's a

00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:07,710
tangible goal that we can set our eyes

00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:10,340
on and kind of work towards it would

00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:14,280
also help further with the fact that our

00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:17,130
rotations would have fewer people on

00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,230
call overall if the service owners could

00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,510
be responsible just for the services

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,370
that they are responsible for we've

00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,800
started changing our model a little bit

00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,750
where instead of having everybody

00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,960
working on all the different services we

00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:34,260
have now these domains or I think

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,320
another common term is like squad where

00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:40,710
a set of people work in a fixed area or

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,630
a specific business aspect of the

00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,420
product and they are responsible for

00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:48,090
this if they were to be on call

00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,980
twenty-four-seven that's not achievable

00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:53,070
at the current state where at so this

00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:55,380
one alert per person is very critical to

00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:57,750
actually getting to the second point of

00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,710
having people being on call for their

00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:03,540
services no matter what obviously as a

00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,240
side effect of that it means probably

00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,880
our systems are more stable anyways so

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,700
even if you're on call twenty-four-seven

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,990
for specific services hopefully that

00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,430
means you're not actually going to be

00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:20,520
woken up in the middle of the night

00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:24,180
anyways again this all comes back down

00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:26,460
to the mean time between failure vs mean

00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,250
time to recovery while we had been

00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,860
working on previously on the meantime to

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:34,860
recovery as I mentioned you work on one

00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,720
the other might go down by nature but

00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,700
then once one is good

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,619
you work on fixing the other thing so

00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,990
now that we're kind of at a place where

00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:45,390
we're okay with our meantime to recovery

00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:49,080
now it's time for us to focus on our

00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:52,260
mean time between failures so these

00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,900
goals will reflect that and of course

00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,359
once that's all done hopefully the world

00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:03,330
will be full of kittens and everyone

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:05,490
will be happy but why going as to a more

00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:07,440
higher level why go through all this

00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:13,170
trouble why put all the stress on people

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:16,380
isn't on called just for ops no that's

00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:18,690
all I really okay well so it's not just

00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,640
one team's responsibility it's the

00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:24,119
entire organizations responsibility as a

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,390
whole to to move towards being proactive

00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,910
rather than reactive everyone should be

00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:33,470
care that their product is stable that

00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:37,590
it's not affecting users negatively I

00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:39,720
also feel that as engineers we all have

00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,670
the sense of responsibility for the code

00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,430
that we ship and we shared this with

00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,800
every single one of our colleagues if we

00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:50,070
don't then I don't that's out of my

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,050
league we also take pride in the code

00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:54,540
that rewrites in knowing that what we

00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:57,390
deliver isn't just delivering value to

00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,099
our customers but also that and

00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,650
therefore our businesses business as

00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:04,200
well but also the quality of our code

00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:07,440
doing things like pull requests getting

00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,750
code reviews testing in pre-production

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,190
all these things or things that we do

00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:14,900
because we want to make sure that our

00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,900
code is as good as it could possibly be

00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:22,710
if we want to achieve this world full of

00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:26,190
kittens though we have to go through

00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:29,940
some pain no pain no gain it's not easy

00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:33,180
though at all and we all need a little

00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:38,490
bit of direction we all need to be

00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:41,250
herded going back again to isn't on

00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:43,440
called just for ops this is a quote from

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,089
Wikipedia so I didn't put it here

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,660
because obviously quoting Wikipedia is a

00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:50,710
little bit of a my professors will tell

00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:55,690
me that's absolutely no

00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:58,390
hey it defines you'll notice i wrote ops

00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,640
here some people might say what about

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,430
DevOps so this is the actual definition

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,160
according to wikipedia of what DevOps is

00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:08,290
it is a culture movement or practice

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,839
that emphasizes the collaboration and

00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,910
communication of both software

00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:15,550
developers and other IT professionals

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:18,310
while automating the process of software

00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:20,589
delivery and infrastructure changes it

00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,900
aims at establishing a culture and

00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:25,710
environment where building testing and

00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:29,859
releasing software can happen rapidly

00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:32,830
frequently and more reliably it has

00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:36,520
nothing about a single team it's talking

00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:39,849
about both software developers and other

00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,910
IDs so again alcohol isn't just for ops

00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:46,300
and DevOps should just be a goal for the

00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:52,420
organization not a team that you have I

00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:55,060
think so anyways so all of this it's not

00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:58,150
easy it's never gonna get easier I ever

00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:01,599
think I I hope that it will but probably

00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:04,119
not and because it's not easy we've

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,220
taken such a long and convoluted path to

00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,849
get to this place where we have some

00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:13,089
process that works for us now but we

00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:16,750
still need to work on it because nothing

00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:20,830
is perfect and we need some direction we

00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:22,420
need to hurt all of our cats thank you

00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:24,810
very much for taking time to listen to

00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,810
my story

00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:36,039
Thank You grace as usual if you have

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:38,309
questions you can find her here at the

00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:38,309
stage

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,860
