our next speaker is Andrew radife he's

00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,660
been working with whales for a while and

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,200
he's been in the back end at the front

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,240
end and most of the places in between

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:21,109
he's also a vim wizards and he's a

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,659
maintainer of vim Ruby in vim rails also

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:26,989
he's quite humble about it so I give you

00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:36,890
Andrew and his ruse walls and gentle

00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:40,100
guidelines hello hello everybody can you

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,019
hear me is everything ok ok cool so hi

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,199
my name is Andrew you can find me on the

00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:46,399
Internet as and you rot if and if you're

00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:48,949
having trouble with the last name just

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,899
remember it starts with rad and ends

00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:54,679
with death and it's basically what I am

00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,589
today I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,960
rules laws and gentle guidelines and the

00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:02,480
lower part of this comes from the law of

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,699
Demeter which we sort of inspired this

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,750
talk at the beginning now if you don't

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,730
know what the law of Demeter is

00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,950
basically goes you know if you have this

00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,840
dis survived Ruby code you see all the

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,700
dots over there that's bad you shouldn't

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,810
have that made dots what you should do

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,270
is you should replace them with

00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,370
underscores and you end up with a great

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,000
method name called user profile address

00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,950
and stuff like user first name order

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,240
order item and of course my favorite

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:31,420
created at to date all methods that I've

00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,010
actually seen in the wild by the way so

00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,250
okay this isn't exactly what the

00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,590
altimeter is about I'm going to go back

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,890
to the source until it's a it was

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,960
originally defined in a paper called

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,610
object-oriented programming an objective

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,550
sense of style I'll talk a bit more

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,290
about the objective bit a bit later but

00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,630
it was 1988 and the finisher in the

00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,830
formal definition which I actually kind

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,230
of stole from Wikipedia cuz I like that

00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:00,590
one better goes like this if you have a

00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,700
method M the final object Oh indeed in

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,790
the actual method in the actual method

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,780
definition you're only allowed to call

00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,000
methods on the following kinds of

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,250
objects on all itself so you know other

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,290
metals of the same object make sense on

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,700
em's parameters all right this is

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,540
interesting and we will talk about this

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,000
a bit later any objects that Eminem

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,189
it's any direct component objects of the

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,219
object so you know instance attributes

00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:25,900
and such and global variable well that

00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:29,019
has its own problems so let's not talk

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,099
about that one in other words you can

00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:32,049
pick your friends and you can pick your

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,989
nose but you can't pick your friends

00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:39,489
house unless they've been provided to

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:41,560
you in a method argument that works the

00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,569
best interpretation of explanation is

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,969
the log limited I've ever seen comes

00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,739
from an article with a book called The

00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:51,099
Paperboy wallet and the law of Demeter

00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:53,980
and in it the scenario is a paperboy

00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:57,310
delivers a paper to a certain customer

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,470
and the paperboard demands payment now

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,299
in order to pay the paperboy the

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,159
customer we get the wallet from the

00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:05,560
customer but we'd get wallets and then

00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,359
we call subtract money on that wallet

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,129
objects which you know see it's pretty

00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:11,560
reasonable the problem with this is that

00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,269
the interpretation is basically well

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,950
you're given your water to somebody and

00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,919
going you know take what you need and

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,799
leave me the rest which is not ideal in

00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,810
practice even if we don't talk about the

00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,120
Rio current interpretation of this it's

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,680
still not ideal code because the

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,290
paperboys being exposed to more

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,970
information that needs to be the

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,010
paperboy seems to know all about the

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,310
wallets about whether there is a wallets

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,260
or whatever the wall is no and we'd like

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,449
to decouple that code from the concept

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,799
of a wallet altogether we don't care if

00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:45,760
the payment is done with a wallet or

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,530
with a credit card bitcoin camino for a

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,049
paper maybe not appropriate but anyway

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,840
the point is david Bach suggests a

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,250
method called get payment which

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,750
encapsulate the payment logic whatever

00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,729
it happens to be and in this case the

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,949
code might look something like this now

00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:05,859
you might notice that the method is

00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:08,349
called get payment and not get wallet

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,150
subtract amount right we don't just

00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,459
concatenate the two methods together

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,290
right even if we call it something a bit

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,000
more sensible like subtract the mark for

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,459
more like even that it's not it's not an

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,220
ideal method name because it still

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,139
mentions the wallet there's still some

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,310
implicit coupling you know we don't have

00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:26,620
a wallet object now we don't care about

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,120
the API that much but we still mention

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,220
the wallet so you know which means we

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,400
can't really switch implementations that

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,960
city and this is mentioned to the actual

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,610
words on paper there's a slightly

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,670
different example by you know it is

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,860
similar subsection 7 the interface if

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,150
you're following all at home goes you

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,240
know the above method appears to be the

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:49,030
water meter but on closer inspection it

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,070
clearly violates the spirit of the law a

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,380
spirit of the law so it's not really

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,480
about replacing dots with runners course

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,300
in this case you have any more rubbish

00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,370
example replacing user dot address with

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,170
user underscore address right user

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,170
address is not a terrible name is it

00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:07,000
snow k name but it does couple this

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,910
methods implementation to the user what

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,650
if there is no user in the shopping cart

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,080
you know this is very easy to do it's

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:18,340
extremely easy to do this in a certain

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,630
framework that everybody might like it's

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,250
easy to just say you know delegate

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,730
address the user and you end up with a

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,740
user address but I'm a better name might

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,840
be shipping address or billing address

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,390
or any other method name that makes

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,370
sense in the context of cards that way

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,870
we can easily replace this wait well

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,640
what a proper relationship that has

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,350
nothing to do with user or we could even

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,150
use some sort of a card that doesn't

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,860
even have a user an anonymous card that

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,610
figures out the you know the address

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:48,479
based on geo AP and the actual products

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,580
are included in there like you know if

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,890
if the shopping cart includes I don't

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,970
know soy milk flavored like rivers

00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,570
that's you know it's probably going to

00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,520
Berlin so my point one that I want to

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,430
make about the altimeter is that naming

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,740
matters that you can't just delegate

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,780
stuff and call it a day because it still

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,870
end up having implicit coupling between

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,850
the methods point2 is that you don't

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,820
even have to delegate anything at all in

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,800
some cases you could resolve the problem

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,690
that the log limiter is pointing to by

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,430
striking a method parameter for instance

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,800
let's take a look at a user that has

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,330
like a dozen email related attributes

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,760
right and we might have a method that

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,650
you know ask the user should we send the

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,330
weekly email to that user now we might

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,250
want to extract all of these email

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,860
attributes to a separate object called

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,750
email settings let's say the problem now

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,030
is that we have a law Demeter violation

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,129
because we call user email address Emil

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:47,830
settings weekly summary right

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:49,899
now one way to fix it is to delegate but

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,239
it seems like we'd be taking a bit of a

00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,309
step backwards what we could do instead

00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:56,949
is we could inject the email settings as

00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:58,300
an argument we would call weekly summary

00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:01,209
on email settings and they did some way

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,610
we would use the user just to provide it

00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:05,050
to the actual email sending methods in

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,699
fact we don't even need to call the user

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,199
now because the API of the user is no

00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,209
longer relevant we can call it a

00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,800
recipient it doesn't have to be a user

00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:14,860
it doesn't have to be connected to a set

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,300
of email settings by doing this you know

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,499
most of the code that we currently have

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,539
it's probably going to be you know just

00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:21,580
going to look like these our first

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,709
argument user second argument that users

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,009
email settings but in the future we

00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:28,869
could easily sense giving you a user the

00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,599
first argument and give a different set

00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:33,219
of email settings for that user may be

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,499
from the organization they're in or

00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:37,599
whatever so with the couple of this code

00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:39,339
you know this code doesn't need to know

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,379
about the connection between the user

00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:45,669
and the email settings if a connection

00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:48,219
even exists now I say that and it is it

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:51,240
is more of a couple code is great it's

00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:53,860
amazing but to be completely honest if

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,449
if i were to refactor anticipating a

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,519
fella power to pull out an email setting

00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,959
subject and so on and so forth i would

00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,309
likely just do something like this i

00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,019
would like you poured email settings to

00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:04,119
the beginning of the method and then you

00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:05,469
know use them in and a bottom half of

00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:07,300
the matter does use email settings as a

00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:09,639
proper domain object which is useful you

00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,059
know it establishes that yes this is a

00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,619
useful domain object but it is of all

00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,240
the emitter violation you know we do

00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:19,119
have the coupling between the user and

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,919
the email settings but we also gained

00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:22,360
the you know the thing that again here

00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,699
is that we don't have to change the

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,369
signature of the method and this it

00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:29,529
might be you know you might say well

00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:33,039
sure it's not a big deal right we can we

00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:34,479
can wrap around we can change it but we

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,849
might also have another like you know

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,339
tend to 1020 methods that we need to do

00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,500
the same thing and it might be not a

00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,719
good idea to do this earlier on but

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,639
maybe we can do this whenever we do have

00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,759
an organization where we do need this

00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:50,139
this method to be the couple now you

00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,880
might disagree with me on this you might

00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,980
say well yes but it's better to

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,420
establish a precedence better to you

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,980
know the couple is called earlier

00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,839
on which is great because in that case

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,790
you're not telling me we should do this

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,160
because the law of Demeter but you know

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,779
actually make an argument here and

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,540
that's my third point that it's not it's

00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:09,550
not an actual law it's a you know you're

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,320
not going to go to jail if you break it

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,740
you're also not going to get a Nobel

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,160
price is also not that kind of a law it

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,139
is it's as much as long as the the paper

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,300
describes an objective sense of style

00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:25,269
especially considering that the actual

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,649
paper says something like well we in

00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:28,420
order to prove it we would need a pretty

00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,070
large scale experiment so we don't have

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,870
that but we do have fourteen thousand

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,320
knives of this code and it seems to work

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,639
for that so it's objectively good and

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,649
the funny thing is the actual paper is

00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,750
well it is very nuanced I mean it does

00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,790
have a section called trade-offs which

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,829
goes like you know writing programs the

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,959
folio of Demeter increases the number of

00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:48,730
methods the abstraction may end up being

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,380
less comprehensible implementation and

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,850
maintain some more difficult there might

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,160
be an increase in the number of

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,110
arguments passes on methods which kind

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,970
of reads like the you know like a

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,000
medicine bottle sort of the side effects

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,279
you expected side effects right here and

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,660
it is true if you know if you've been

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,820
paying attention to the examples you can

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,640
you can see how taking it to the extreme

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,589
might end up where you know you might

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,329
want end up with a lot of methods on a

00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:15,880
particular object we might end up with

00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,820
with a lot of arguments objects it kind

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,019
of depends so there's a trade-off here

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,790
which is why I really I really don't

00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,230
want to call it the law in either I kind

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,579
of dislike the name I really would

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,790
prefer it to call it the guideline of

00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:29,199
Twitter or something like that it's a

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,630
tool to understand your code it's a tool

00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:33,550
to figure out where there's coupling in

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,380
the code and you know at that point you

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,290
can decide on your own you're on your

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,660
own or with your team you know how

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,300
exactly to fix this problem or whether

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,670
to fix it now or delay the solution

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,980
until a later time and it's definitely

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:51,310
not a weapon to win internet arguments

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,880
which I seen it used more often that I'd

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:57,430
like much like a different principle

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,600
call srp very I think it's very popular

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,610
principal at least a single

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,889
responsibility principle and it's kind

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,779
of it's kind of obvious in terms of I

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:06,819
don't know the name really says it by

00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,400
single responsibility you know classes

00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:09,780
should have just one responsibility

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,200
should have just one response and do one

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:15,750
thing right let's say this class which

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,150
you know obviously updates the comment

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,550
it's right there the name isn't and it's

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,260
a sinner schweiz with a comment you know

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,600
we save the comment and transaction and

00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:27,150
with you two other things that are

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,770
somehow related to saving the comment

00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,690
updating comment just some sort of

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,640
dependencies of the comment that we

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,060
encapsulate and this nifty method called

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,200
update in DC class code update comment

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,200
which is you know it's it's okay it's

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,500
not it's not a backlash it's reasonable

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,200
does one thing until you see a not a

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,880
class called destroy comment which well

00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,910
it destroys a comment and any calls the

00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,470
exact same methods and all right so

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,360
these two methods are literally copy

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,340
paste between these two classes so i'm

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,010
not saying that both of them are not

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,630
single responsibility they are but maybe

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,570
there's a responsibility they are

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:07,260
sharing their it kind of is not in the

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:11,970
right place you know we could yeah we

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:14,340
could use callbacks with our or m we

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,340
could do that yeah that's not a Sharpedo

00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,590
I mean it's not as rupiah this aureum is

00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,510
not i sir piero it does so much stuff

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,010
it's not it's not okay all right what

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,480
about we still need to merge these

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,580
classes somehow I we still need to use

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,360
like just one class for you what if what

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,070
if we call the comment manager yeah

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,210
that's not a therapy at all how would

00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,250
you fight that blog post it said

00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,830
managers you can't call things manager

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,590
the dis bad alright how about we call it

00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,330
a comment lifecycle we give it a comment

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,830
we have an update method which does the

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,060
whole update dance we have a destroy

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,830
method which is called destroy dance

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,810
comment life cycle has a responsibility

00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,080
of taking care of your any sort of

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,610
changes to to the comments lifetime but

00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,320
we could add I don't like we could add

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,870
states they're publishing unpublishing

00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,390
motivation who knows yeah I don't know

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,670
though it's like two methods in there is

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:07,290
two methods in the class nah it's not

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,700
very sorry not very soupy at all or so

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:11,430
let's take a step back and talk about

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,440
the origins of SRB it was invented by

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,660
Robert world was named by robert c

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,300
martin and he sort of created it as a

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,490
natural extension to the concepts of

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,939
separation of concerns coupling cohesion

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,639
in the in the ninth

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:26,589
nice i couldn't find Lex the definitive

00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,529
definition but in one of his blog post

00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:32,559
he does explain it as each software mod

00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,689
who should have one and only one reason

00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,720
to change now this is interesting

00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,889
because the way I've heard it and what

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,289
I've experienced it in the way I've

00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:42,879
argued with people or you know people

00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:44,289
who argue with me it's it's more of you

00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,089
know it should do one thing right you

00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:48,729
look at the classical imagica what this

00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:51,309
should do one thing or it does too much

00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:53,579
it just it does too much we should which

00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:56,979
is split up or something but instead

00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:58,449
Uncle Bob names it you know calls it it

00:13:56,979 --> 00:14:00,399
should have one reason to change which

00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:02,049
is a bit different I would argue that

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,959
they're actually quite similar sort of

00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:07,149
different angles look at the problem but

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,489
it is a different angle and I don't

00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:10,989
really I really hear that much in

00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:13,439
arguments to be honest I haven't really

00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:16,809
had anybody go like well this class has

00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:20,769
two reasons to change and more than that

00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:22,629
is you know it does too much right so

00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:23,769
I'm now faced with the with the problem

00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,749
that i'm not sure which one of the two

00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:28,239
things to complain about so just

00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:31,149
complain about boat let's start with an

00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:33,009
example we have a test here that has

00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,319
like a ghost of registration page

00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:37,059
philsie login details I should have

00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,699
really should have like actually showed

00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:42,369
you the page as in actually designed it

00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:43,599
but was a lot of effort so I I didn't do

00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:45,459
it you're going to have to use your

00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:47,529
imagination it feeling login details it

00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:49,329
goes like well you know you fill in the

00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,649
e-mail with it with the parameters like

00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:53,279
you can imagine like this little box

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:55,419
with email and password rightness and

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,009
feel an address that's basically the

00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:59,499
same thing with like more input to the

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:02,169
box hope you can see it in your mind's

00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:05,709
eye and now i'm feelin banking it

00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:07,449
fulfills in the banking info and also

00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,249
clicks the submit button and i don't

00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:13,359
know about you but this part of me so

00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:15,489
much because it doesn't do it it does

00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:17,709
too much it definitely that I I think I

00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:20,439
would be safe to say this method does

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,119
too much a pretty easy thing to do here

00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:24,819
is to just separate into two pieces

00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:26,470
right here I'm banking it for what does

00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:28,509
it do well it fills in these fields

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,579
right the banking information submit

00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:33,549
form what is it do it clicks the right

00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:34,750
button Cole looks like this perfectly

00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:37,150
reasonable makes sense

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:40,120
all right but what if we did something

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,600
different what if instead of taking

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,250
stuff our would put some more stuff in

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,690
what if you put all the email fields and

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,130
a password feels like right there and

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,280
this method it's called feeling bank and

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:54,070
fo what if we also put the first line

00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,340
lose the register page now go and

00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,380
banking info does everything what that's

00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,390
terrible isn't it does it's way too much

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,670
right i mean i took a method that

00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,250
already did too much and I made it do

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,320
even more stuff well what if we name is

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,180
registered user then we let me to

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,890
register user as well what does it do it

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,540
goes to registration page fills in all

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,250
of the the fields in the user

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,160
registration form and then it submits

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:21,880
the form code looks like you register

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,740
user expect whatever register user can

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,420
expect that an email has been sent maybe

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,580
registry would invalid user parameters

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,830
we can we use this method over the place

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,540
and uh seems like it makes sense it

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,630
seems like it does one thing as it

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,690
doesn't register oosik user the thing is

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,580
the way I like to look at it is the

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,040
problem with looking at a better method

00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,810
than going well it does too much the

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,910
reason that it does too much might be

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,520
related to the fact that the name of the

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:51,339
method doesn't accurately fit the

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,930
contents of the method it's it's kind of

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:55,390
obvious when I say it like this way it

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,670
is a different angle to look at it so

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,310
there might be a name that we can use

00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,830
that would change this method to not

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,110
really do that much it would actually be

00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,689
a name that would fit the current

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,130
contents of the method which we work so

00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,560
again we kind of have a naming problem

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,089
here as in first of all it makes it's a

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,620
good idea to think about is this the

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:16,900
right name for this abstraction is this

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,000
why maybe we're feeling that we don't

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,490
that this method or class or whatever

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,280
does too much maybe there's a concept

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,199
here that we're missing right and it

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,590
also shows my second point that it's not

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,910
always about studying things up I think

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:35,740
I don't know I don't know about you but

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:38,650
I've often had this problem SRP is that

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,710
a lot of people you know the users RPS

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:44,080
sort of a reason to chop up the code in

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,910
little pieces and and you could do that

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,530
right well as you can see you can also

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,730
sort of redraw the borders in a

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,160
different way

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,480
you can add more stuff to it you can add

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,650
more stuff to this method and rename it

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,110
in a different way you can move things

00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,900
around and it still works in some way

00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,860
and I've showed you this example in the

00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,410
beginning but I didn't really explain

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,929
why this example is separating this way

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,370
why do we have four matters here there

00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,040
might be a reason there might be that

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,690
you know we use these address and

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,220
banking info is in the in other places

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,620
but we have other places that we feel

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,929
and the stuff but it might not be the

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,850
case in fact if it isn't the case by

00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:21,190
separating into four different pieces

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,350
yeah we end up just copy pasting this

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,020
block of four pieces every time we need

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,820
to register user right we could still

00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,940
expect it matter but there's a question

00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,230
of do we need these four methods and I

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,750
don't know if we do it kind of depends

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,130
on the context and well I made up this

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,100
example so I didn't really make up the

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,750
context for us but it is very easy it is

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,760
actually much easier to look at this

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,470
method and go well here's an easy way to

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,450
to fix the issue just just split it up

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,980
at that point it's very obvious and you

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,090
don't really need to look at anything

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,000
else you can just look at this one

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:54,669
method and you know limit yourself to it

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,830
and go if I split it it'll work but you

00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:58,870
might also take a step back and see if

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,270
there is a different way to achieve a

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,830
similar thing by now we're splitting

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,809
this message by by reordering the code

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,340
in different places we joined the

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,520
borders so how the reason to change

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,660
fitting the whole thing well in

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,910
principles patterns and practices Uncle

00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,790
Bob Robertson Martin described this

00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,799
example of an interface modem interface

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,540
which would formatted style hang up send

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,000
and receive and he he points out that

00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:24,640
the down hang up methods are you have to

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,410
do with the connection and the send and

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,290
receive have responsibility over the

00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,850
actual message passing right and he says

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,679
you know these are two responsibilities

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:36,340
and they are you could name them in this

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,980
way should you well it depends on how

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,720
the application is changing if the

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,190
application is not changing in ways it

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,290
calls are two responsibilities to change

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:47,169
at different times then there's no need

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,000
to separate them if they were changing

00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:50,140
you know separately independent

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,030
different for each other maybe they were

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,500
even handled by different teams I mean

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,200
this kind of example it's a bit

00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,090
difficult to have this idea but think

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,190
about separating HTML and JavaScript for

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,370
example were you know HTML and the

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,320
database layer

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,670
if you happen to be a web developer all

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,180
my examples are wavy I'm sorry about

00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:10,280
that anyway what he says is that an axis

00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,710
of change is only an access of change if

00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:17,180
the change is actually occur it's not

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:18,470
wise supply the srp dsl principle or any

00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,590
other principle for that matter if there

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,270
is no symptom that's what Robert see

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,410
Martin said the actually I'm the person

00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:29,300
that introduced srp and this is why sort

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,030
of my last point is that reasons to

00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,400
change is a bit of an estimation you

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,920
can't really tell what the reasons to

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,270
change are definitely going to be you

00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,280
can make an estimation based on your

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,900
experience general experience experience

00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,090
with the project experience with this

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,910
particular team stress with the business

00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,429
even as to how things will change in the

00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:53,059
future and you know it's very likely

00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:54,710
that you might be wrong but again this

00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,240
is yeah it's just the tool to understand

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,650
your code it's just a tool to look at

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,390
the code of a particular perspective and

00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:02,679
go well it seems to me like this is the

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:05,210
way it might change and it's not really

00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:08,360
appropriate to just go well this isn't

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,370
srp let's cross it out and let's do

00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,380
something else you might want to explain

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,840
why you think this is the case because

00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,309
it's a bit of a fuzzy principle of all

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,929
of these principles are kind of fuzzy to

00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:19,809
be honest like I which also had a dime

00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:22,100
to you know to go over all of them and

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:23,809
explain why I think they're refers II

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,030
but I don't have the time I really wish

00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:27,830
I did I don't really wish idea because

00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,720
it would be a lot of effort but you know

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,559
I wish I did have the time and also

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,700
infinite willpower that wedding right

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,970
but I don't have time for that so I'm

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,160
gonna talk for about one last principle

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,679
which is very close to my heart not in a

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,080
good way it's easier to ask forgiveness

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,580
than it is to get permission not exactly

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,500
a program in principle but you know

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:53,030
often using this context i discovered

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,170
and i have a story about this one i

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,059
actually have a lot of stories about

00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:58,730
this one did all start in the same way

00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:01,070
with me coming into the office you know

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,710
in generally good mood I'm getting cup

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,800
of coffee I'm very happy and joyful and

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:09,200
then pulling from gay and in this

00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,140
particular story when I pulled from gear

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,260
I discovered that somebody has been hard

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,460
at work at 3am in the morning

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,730
you see there was this uh this one

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,620
partial Justin HTML fragment is being

00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,940
reused across the application something

00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,180
like that buy you some product or

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:29,210
whatever and it was gone it wasn't there

00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,070
anymore I was wondering why that might

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:33,260
be the case where is it right sorry to

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,930
look for it the place where is actually

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,610
rendered what isn't rendered in the

00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,300
Senate rails were anymore its vendor

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:43,430
with some method called him some class

00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,290
I'm sorry good okay more worried because

00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,820
I'm looking around for this class and

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,310
ripping around for this class in the

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,500
application I can't really find it can't

00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:55,100
really find the class anyway where is

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:58,490
the class why do I cannot find how this

00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,950
partial is output and and then I

00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:05,030
discover that there is a new gem in the

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:06,980
gemfile some internal gem which at that

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,800
point I'm going to really reword because

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,810
why would this part this one sort of

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,910
HTML fragment be taken out of the

00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:16,850
application like I don't know how many

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,680
of you web developers but it's the CSS

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,060
for this partial is in the application

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,770
like all the JavaScript it has to do

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,990
with it like if you ever have to change

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,790
anything like styling or whatever on it

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,800
you you have to know that it's not

00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:30,170
separate whether when the library name

00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,790
doesn't really make much sense in

00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,040
connection to this particular partial

00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:36,490
and very confused sign into panik's

00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:40,280
aren't they have a really bad day now

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:45,320
but then I look at the actual gym and

00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:50,530
I'm enlightened you see the gym had a/c

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:55,510
extension at the six tension had a a

00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,510
macro which was a

00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:07,649
anyway

00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:10,710
a lot of web developers the team had

00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:15,629
noticed this and we sort of got together

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:17,279
and we we couldn't talk the actual

00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:19,529
person he see the actual person was not

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,840
he wasn't exactly in the development

00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:24,809
team he was kind of administrative but

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,059
not exactly he was a sort of he was sort

00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:29,549
of a genius I don't know if you know the

00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:32,299
kind the one that commits stuff at 3am

00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:34,679
in the morning entry in the morning babe

00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:37,470
we talked to CEO who is fully on board

00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,950
he was yo this is great this is actually

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,989
it's very fast it's very fat which is

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:45,389
now listen to be fair it was very fast

00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:48,269
it was very fast it was in fact almost

00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:54,450
as fast as it used to be when we were

00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:56,549
cashing it with memcache but you know we

00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,590
would need to catch a whim cash if it

00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,960
was just called it properly it wouldn't

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:04,759
be necessary to cash it would be just we

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,820
working code it properly and see a

00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:10,590
phrase that hughes was used the best

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,359
tool for the job which is another

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:16,470
principle that i could talk for another

00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:18,269
10 to 15 minutes for but you know this

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:22,529
example is gonna have to suffice to show

00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:24,779
my opinion of it there was yeah there

00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:27,029
was yeah we're not really gonna touch it

00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:29,009
again it's not it's just there it's fine

00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:31,230
it's working it's okay it's not really

00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:32,429
gonna this was empirically disproven by

00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,629
the way because we you know in the next

00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:39,049
three months we had to implement the

00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:42,330
minor stuff like translations and they

00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:49,320
formatting and parsing with localization

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:50,909
in time zones and HTML escaping turns

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,759
out that the printf family functions

00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:57,559
does not automatically HTML escape its

00:25:53,759 --> 00:26:00,179
inputs there's not even a flag for it

00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:05,039
one might argue that maybe it isn't the

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:08,070
best tool for the job then but I would

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:11,519
it touch it again with it but this this

00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:13,230
last point since last point he made this

00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,090
is the reason I'm putting it in this

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,419
bucket here in Anthony stories it's

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,879
already done

00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:22,269
it's done it's it's right there I'm

00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:23,980
worried you do reverted his hard work he

00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:27,909
put in at three in the morning without

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,499
consulting anyone this is why I hate

00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:31,809
this principle to be honest because it

00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:34,059
is absolutely true it's easier to ask

00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:35,769
for well the forgiveness part to be

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:39,730
honest is kind of optional it I've

00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:41,289
noticed anyway I did I can't really

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,970
remember a situation in which the

00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:47,619
forgiveness part ever sort of occurred

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,659
but it is easier it's so much easier to

00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:52,600
just you know you just not don't care

00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:54,009
about what anybody else is gonna say

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,980
about it you just do what you want and

00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:58,659
then they will probably thank you in the

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,649
morning I'm sure that the older but oh

00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:05,289
I'm so glad that this was implemented

00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:06,549
like you know if but yeah I know what

00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:08,919
you're gonna say right this is a stupid

00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,299
example it's an extreme example right

00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,200
you wouldn't you wouldn't do something

00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:12,460
that's right you would never do

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,139
something it's like if you were to do

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,789
something like this it would be correct

00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:19,989
like it would be it would not be stupid

00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:21,580
which may be the case you know it might

00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:24,759
be that yeah you know you know that

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,340
everybody else is I'm not gonna say

00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:29,289
stupid but maybe to set in their ways to

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,139
appreciate whatever it is you're trying

00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:34,779
to do for them but even if that's the

00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:37,210
case even if you are category right like

00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:39,129
even if I like if I went around all my

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,249
co-workers workstations and I replaced

00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:44,799
their sublime text with them now I'm not

00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:46,419
saying that them is you know better than

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,119
sublime text or anything although it is

00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:50,950
true but what I'm what I'm saying is you

00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,659
know it's even if it were true right

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,590
even if it were one hundred percent

00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:58,989
objectively true which it is I kind of

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:01,059
feel like you know anything I talked in

00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:02,950
CT yelling I got him on board oh we have

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:05,859
been now every wise the newest

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:10,330
woody and you know I kind of doubt that

00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:12,609
people would just go oh well I guess I

00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:15,190
have to learn to like them now two days

00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:17,559
before my deadlines I guess that's just

00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,330
what I have to do I'm very glad that

00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:24,999
somebody did this without talking to me

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:27,129
and trusting my judgment in any way it's

00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:28,299
not a no it's there's a lot of context

00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:30,070
involving the whole thing right i mean

00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:32,050
maybe there is a context

00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,510
which this does make sense maybe there's

00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:36,220
a context in which we go just go away

00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,720
there's servers on fire you know what to

00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,670
do we're not going to go around and ask

00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,850
people what to do right I'm gonna

00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:45,700
consult with people right but it you

00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:48,010
know it kind of you can I have to think

00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,910
about that context you have to learn to

00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:56,010
apply this context you can't you can't

00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:58,630
really fit a complex context-dependent

00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:02,350
programming principle in a tweet length

00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:03,970
sentence although funnily enough this

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:08,340
one fits quite nicely in for 140

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:10,330
characters when I first learned about

00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,670
pretty much all these principles I

00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:15,520
devolved meter I was it was eye-opening

00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:17,140
it was like oh like this is why I mean

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,940
in such forget it it's why I'm writing

00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,370
all these chains of methods and I know

00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,260
not to be so tighten couple is well I

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:26,500
didn't like I didn't call coupled at

00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,880
that point I suppose but but every new

00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,000
principal would give me this this

00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,890
additional understanding of how you know

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,780
how to write better code how in what way

00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:39,580
my code fails badly but in time I would

00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,710
also come to her and you know the

00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,200
drawbacks the what happens when you take

00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,360
it too far but it happens when you go

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,460
overboard with trying to you know with

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,650
creating like 30 delegations that

00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,650
delegate 230 delegations which dedicate

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,210
to you need it you end up in a place

00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,980
where you could just call any method and

00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:03,040
it would call anything in something at

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:05,560
some point it's about figuring out with

00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,350
time okay when I was preparing for this

00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,540
talk I even you know I read the actual

00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:14,310
paper like the original paper objects

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,750
you know objective sense of style and

00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:19,420
most of the stuff I read there I already

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,130
knew like you blog post videos you find

00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,300
out if you find stuff out yeah some of

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,940
this stuff usually find out about

00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,650
yourself but I did discover actually

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,060
something brand-new I did discover that

00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,350
there's a strong law of Demeter and a

00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,210
weak law of Demeter I didn't know about

00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:34,150
that I don't know if if any of you know

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:36,610
about that but I do think that this was

00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:38,140
it was actually something brand-new ever

00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,290
and for principle that I've known for

00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:43,120
three years and knowing all this stuff

00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,399
trying to learn the stuff trying to to

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,169
push

00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:47,779
after all this stuff ends up to being

00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:50,659
able to apply it better ends up to being

00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:52,399
able to figure out you know what is the

00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:54,710
good way to apply when should I not

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,109
apply it and when should I just know hey

00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:59,029
this is it's good and all but at this

00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:02,299
point in time it's not a good idea to go

00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:03,589
in that direction maybe yeah and the

00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:05,690
last advice I can give you is don't

00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:09,259
force push the semester at three in the

00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:12,379
morning I will write a white paper if I

00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:14,619
have to please don't do it thank you for

00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:14,619
your time

00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:28,970
thank you Andrew I really love these

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:31,250
wars time stories like it's everyone

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,870
heads of them if you have any questions

00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,050
for Andrew find him in the hallway and

00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:38,050
talk with him I have a lot more stories

00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,050
yeah

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,410
