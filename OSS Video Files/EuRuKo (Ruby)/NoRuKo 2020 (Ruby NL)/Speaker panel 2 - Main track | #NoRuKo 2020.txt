- Julik Tarkhanov is a software developer at WeTransfer where he is responsible for the backend components of the Transfer product, enabling effortless transfer of creative ideas. Prior to WeTransfer he worked in the visual effects industry creating images that inspire and befuddle. On his free time he explores weird user interfaces and plays trumpet.
