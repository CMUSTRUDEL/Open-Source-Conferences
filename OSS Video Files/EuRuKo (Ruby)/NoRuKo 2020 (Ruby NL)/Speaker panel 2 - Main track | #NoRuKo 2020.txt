	00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,240
hi there

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,240
thank you so much to the both of you

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,880
that was absolutely wonderful

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,560
so we are coming on pretty close to our

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,600
to the time slot for our

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,480
panel discussion so i don't know do we

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,480
have time for a quick question writer

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,000
um i think we're gonna go straight to

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,439
the to the panel

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,960
so we're waiting for for tom to join

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,680
and there he

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,680
is

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,520
you've moved i've moved yes

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,000
tom has teleported well

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,920
welcome everyone so thank you julie here

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,760
for your for your talk

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,760
um so we have some questions for you

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,840
um here can i start with you

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,680
so did anything announced that was

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,760
coming to ruby 3 this year

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,880
jump out q and why

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,760
personally i'm really excited about the

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,479
actor pattern coming to ruby and the

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,520
raptor

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,759
implementation uh that's in progress

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,280
i've been closely watching the

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,000
vr open on ruby slash ruby on github and

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,799
trying to get my hands dirty playing

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,040
with actors

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,040
and learning the the new ruby model and

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,600
providing feedback

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
so i'm excited to see where it goes

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,799
thanks eunice how about you

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,399
um i think i'm uh i'm really excited

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
about the work samuel williams

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,520
is doing and about the non-blocking i o

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,439
because i think

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,960
at the moment uh most of these

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,920
especially network-bound

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,159
uh applications that we write in ruby uh

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,320
they could benefit from more concurrency

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,680
uh and a lot of performance bottlenecks

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,680
are i o bound and if

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
all of the i o could become non-blocking

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,439
this would really

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,719
put ruby back in the same leagues with

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,960
node and go

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,000
in terms of i o performance and

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,280
concurrency therefore

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
so i'm really excited for those

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,640
thank you ramon you have a question for

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,840
tom

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,680
well um before i i want to give tom the

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,360
opportunity also to tell us what he

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,879
is excited about in ruby three if

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,680
anything that jump if there's anything

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,680
that jumped out at you

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,680
uh for me it's probably the the pattern

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,239
matching um although i think that's just

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,280
becoming stable in 3.0

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,959
the erector metal reactor model is also

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,360
very interesting to me

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,560
i would very much like to see how that

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,680
becomes defined on what

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,680
final product that becomes

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,239
awesome thank you all so much um here's

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,519
more of a

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,400
cheeky question if i may uh what's your

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,319
go-to karaoke song

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,239
by the way we do have a sign up sheet

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,519
for karaoke later today

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,159
it's going to be dot lee slash no ruco

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,800
dash

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,319
karaoke i hope the link will come up on

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,440
on the youtube chat below

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,480
so sorry yes uh yulik do you have one

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,159
oh last time i went to karaoke i was so

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,080
drunk that i actually forgot

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,799
so it's gonna take too long for me to

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,159
remember which song that was

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,360
probably something from the village

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,480
people that's a big choice

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,840
how about you care

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,400
uh yeah personally i think i almost

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
never

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,120
been to karaoke or at least like i've

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,440
i've passed by my friends uh

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,319
singing but i've never done that myself

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,440
so

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,480
not sure i have one yet but uh maybe

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,319
i'll have one once once i try it uh with

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,040
some ruby people

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,040
tonight tonight

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,680
you've got a chance today how about you

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,480
do you gotta a go-to song

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,120
uh not really the only other time i did

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,159
karaoke was yoruko 2019

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,040
uh otherwise i would say like uh

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,239
backstreet boys i want it that way

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,040
that's a good song

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,840
it's a good karaoke song passionately

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,359
nice

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,359
okay we'll remember that

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,720
so um i'm curious uh eulek um

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,000
how did you get started with with the

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,280
with ruby how

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,800
old were you when you started

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:37,120
programming how does two questions

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,000
um so when i started programming that

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,080
was in

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,120
in high school and we just had to

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,880
program a little bit

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,479
in basic which was which was just part

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,720
of the regular you know

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,960
high school curriculum but i didn't pay

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,120
much attention to it and then i got into

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,520
programming when i was about 18

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,440
and i just needed some web work done

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,759
because i was a designer on a project

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,360
and the guy who was supposed to be the

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
web developer on the project

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,199
he just said i'm not i'm not programming

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,800
that this stuff that you were designing

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,039
and then i was like well okay then i'll

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,360
gotta try myself

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,160
and uh with ruby i've been busy for

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,320
maybe 12

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,360
13 years i think i started using ruby

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,039
around the same time

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,280
as uh um as the

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,039
uh victor who was given a presentation

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,800
earlier um on the

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,759
on the community tracks about 14 years

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,759
ago 15 or so

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,560
something like that

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
14 15 years ago uh that's a really one

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,360
time

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:43,039
yeah i know uh how about you care

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,639
um so i've started programming when i

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,360
was in still in school maybe like

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
13 years old i was doing some html and

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
css

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,560
websites because that seemed fun and

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
then i wanted to

00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,000
to add some more dynamic things to those

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,360
websites so i've learned php

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and uh i started making some

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,800
cash uh doing websites for for other

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,880
people

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,680
uh still back in school i mostly use

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,880
that to buy more games for playstation

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,000
um and uh

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
a few years after that i discovered that

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,639
there is

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,080
uh rails and ruben rails and it takes so

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,039
much less time

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,080
to do all the crud applications with

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,240
rails than i used to do with php

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,319
it's literally like one day of work

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,039
versus a week of work

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,400
um so i started getting into rubin rails

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,960
uh

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,720
and i think that was about uh ten years

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,240
ago

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,360
so i uh and that's yeah i can't believe

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,400
i've been doing

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,280
ruby for already 10 years

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,280
wow 10 years how about you tom

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,639
uh it's been a while and remember i

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,039
started out with html and dreamweaver

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,880
i'm not quite sure when that was

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,000
but i started the actual first

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,840
programming language was probably

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,080
visualbasic.net around 2005 2006.

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,120
then switch to php and then ruby and

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,759
then

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,240
git at the same time i remember that

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,599
that was

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,440
uh when i was doing my bachelor's

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,440
so that's a couple many years ago now

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,280
awesome so you know um

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,680
eureka kira you just gave us a a pre uh

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,240
a

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,680
really wonderful well choreographed

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
pre-recorded talk and i'm

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,880
and i'm wondering how how is that

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,000
experience for you is this your first

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
time doing something like this

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,199
i don't know for for me it was the first

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,280
experience of doing uh of doing a

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,400
talk in uh in a duel and it was

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,360
challenging

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,759
for me it was challenging because like

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,599
the

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,080
the timing the timing wasn't right the

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,960
tools weren't cooperating all sorts of

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,160
all sorts of challenges it was also

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,280
different

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,160
do it live sorry sorry keir

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,680
go ahead i'm sorry i was saying that it

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,120
was also the first time for me

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,160
doing it um doing it pre-recorded

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,960
and also first time for me doing that

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,000
many

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,680
transitions between uh speakers

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,280
um and as elix said that was uh

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,960
a bit trickier i'm not sure if we would

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,800
if that would be easier if we did it

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,440
live because transitions

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,279
live would be could be terrible and now

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
at least you like was able to cut some

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,320
of the

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,839
uh gaps

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,920
yeah i i pro i probably will try this

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,399
again but it was it was really um

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,160
it was really special i i didn't have

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,320
this experience before

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,440
yeah it can be pretty hard right how

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,680
about you tommy yeah

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,839
you got some experience with uh doing

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,760
this kind of pre-production

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:05,040
um well i oh sorry

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,760
so you you were you were addressing

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,120
i was i was asking tom sorry yeah

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,240
i do not have any experience with the

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,480
pre-production of it i probably would

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,680
get too much into detail like trying to

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,240
get it all perfect

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,000
take out all the small gaps i make and

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,399
never get around to actually

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,760
finishing it so probably better that i

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,959
just do it live and accept

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,519
any faults in the in the presentation i

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,200
understand

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:36,240
eulek i'm sorry please please go ahead

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
uh well i'm i'm saying like uh

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,839
it was it was super challenging but also

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,250
very very rewarding

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,440
uh that's good to hear

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,560
[Music]

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,839
awesome excellent so um tom

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,839
what are your favorite tools for

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
development

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,800
i already mentioned one in my talk

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,399
i love him i love using that um

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,240
really thankful to the people who told

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,959
me to like hey maybe you should

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,680
try film when i was using sublime text

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,440
uh

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,800
back in the day um of course i

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,600
also love git uh like i get a lot of in

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,600
the detail and

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,640
the magical commands that some people

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,000
stay away from

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,000
so i love that and personally like for

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,880
personal automation i use hammerspoon a

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,880
lot on my computer

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,680
mission that's in my system is done

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,880
through that all the shortcuts all the

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,519
window management

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,640
i can just write everything in lua and

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,640
go crazy basically

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,760
awesome and how about you akira what are

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,200
your favorite development tools

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,920
i'll throw uh some uh some

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,480
some tools that are kind of on the edge

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,680
uh

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,240
to to make it interesting uh lately i've

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,519
been

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,800
enjoying using sorbet to to type my ruby

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,120
code

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,839
especially for areas of code where

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,959
the price of a mistake of or of no

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,240
method error

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,240
would be too high

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,399
and i think at this point sorbet now as

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,760
a is pretty mature

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,720
as a library as a thing to adopt

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,640
and another tool uh that i've been

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,760
exploring and enjoying lately is

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,120
is nix uh it makes managing

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,920
local dependencies so much easier uh

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,200
you can think of it as a brew but

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,680
without

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,120
all the versioning and conflicting uh

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,320
things that you might have

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,360
experienced with brew um

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,519
and uh yeah those are two things i would

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,240
suggest uh

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,959
um checking for anyone who is curious to

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
explore new tools

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,279
nice and uh eulek what are your favorite

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,279
development tools

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,480
uh so i would say my development tools

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,240
are uh well first i i'm probably one of

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,000
the few dinosaurs who are still

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,360
firmly with mate yay so that's even less

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,880
than ten percent because somebody is

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
suggesting that there are ten percent of

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,680
emacs users where there are even less

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,360
text materials

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:25,120
uh and the other thing that i

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,360
uh use a lot and ruby is actually

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,200
one of those things and i think this is

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,079
something we do not have nearly enough

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,800
of these days

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,399
are things which are dynamically

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,240
dynamically changeable

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,480
meaning languages where when something

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
doesn't work you are allowed to take a

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,240
big crowbar

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,959
and go inside the thing and change the

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
way it works

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,000
ruby works this way javascript until you

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,920
introduce

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,680
sophisticated pre-compilers works this

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,240
way small talks

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,079
use this way so anything that brings us

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,120
kind of closer to mutable computing as

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,120
they say

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,399
uh i guess those are my my tools of

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,800
choice because i think i

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,639
i think this just makes it just creates

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,839
a different relationship between the

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,839
computer and the and the computer user

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,040
awesome thank you all right why don't

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,720
you

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,440
maybe tell us a little bit about your

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,440
favorite tools

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,360
yeah for development um

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,079
well i've been uh thinking out around

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,120
with the

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:31,279
film as well a bit um

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,519
but i'm not i'm not still i'm not very

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,440
experienced just yet

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:40,800
and um well actually my tools are pretty

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,120
pretty basic i don't have that much

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,120
experience just yet so i'm taking all

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,839
the advice i can get and try and think

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,079
around a bit

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,600
it's not like i'm i'm like still willing

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,199
and able to try out

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,880
a lot and i'm still learning so again

00:13:53,199 --> 00:14:00,399
um i just switched from uh from atom

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,800
to to to film and it's it's uh it's nice

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,680
but i still have to like learn a lot

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,560
it's a lot of muscle memory so

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,160
yeah so everyone yet like if you have a

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,959
nice tip and then i'll just

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,079
i try see if i like it but it's not like

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,040
yes this is it

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,720
and and if i don't uh it's no it's not

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,760
this or or die

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,079
how about you ramon um

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,040
yeah i think i'm also in that uh in that

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,160
vim boat

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,160
uh i enjoy it very much uh just

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,519
feels super fun to do i do look at

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,480
people using uh

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,800
visual studio code and and thinking like

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,199
i

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,320
i'm like i'm almost ready to to check it

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,720
out and then i'm like but

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,399
like my vim keys are making it hard for

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
me to make the transition so

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,519
like i dabble in it every now and then

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,720
but i just it's

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,040
i don't know old habits die hard i guess

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,000
um if i want to give a shout out to a

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,399
tool

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,440
i was having a problem that uh i use

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,880
tmux to manage

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,079
my my windows in my terminal and i was

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,920
having a problem where it was getting

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:06,560
really slow to open

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:10,160
a open a new uh console in my tmux

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,560
and i found that the culprit was a nvm

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,199
node version manager i had a lot of node

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,959
versions

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,399
installed and so that was slowing me

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,440
down quite a bit getting it into my

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,360
environment

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,199
and someone pointed me to a tool written

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,839
in reason which is a programming

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,320
language

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,240
called fnm i'm not affiliated with them

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,560
that someone recommended it to me

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,440
and that cut my my startup time from 10

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,720
seconds to

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,000
a couple milliseconds so shout out to

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,660
them thanks for the work

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,660
[Laughter]

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,639
yeah so um so tom have you been trying

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,639
out any

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,639
new other programming languages

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:53,839
lately um

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,240
not lately i've still been i'm i'm still

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,680
trying to learn rust more

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,160
i'm trying to get more familiar with

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,759
that is very happy to hear that

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,759
i like rust yeah that's good

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,399
yeah i mean too like we we use that app

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,839
signal and i want to work more on the

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,040
parts that use it a lot

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,120
and currently still have to get really

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,079
i get a lot of help trying to get things

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,120
sorted out

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,120
understand what's going on

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,839
how about the rest of you care

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,560
i've been uh playing with rust as well

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,360
especially during the lockdown i think

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,000
for

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,759
a month or so all of my spare time i was

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,399
learning and playing with rust

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,839
i would love to shout out to a few

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,800
people from the rus community who do

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,759
youtube tutorials especially those where

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,759
where they

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,000
take a problem and start coding and that

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,800
youtube video is maybe like

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,680
60 90 minutes but they go through all

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,079
the

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,279
language features that they use and why

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,600
they use them

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,360
and and what are some of the things that

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,959
are not super obvious

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:07,439
so i learned a lot from that um and

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:10,559
i think rust is pretty cool for um

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,120
for stuff like uh tcp proct practice at

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,319
work

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,640
uh i like

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,400
a lot of uh stuff with scale in shopify

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,280
has to do with introducing a proxy

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,559
between a client and the server

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,039
so rather than connecting from

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,079
rails to mysql directly rails connects

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,400
to

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,120
a multiplexing proxy in between which

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,320
helps to

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,400
take a lot of load from my sql and uh

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,640
there is a proxy like that for pretty

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,240
much every um

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,440
every database type that we use and uh

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,720
i've been playing with rust uh writing a

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,520
database proxy in it

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,559
uh i really enjoyed it and i hope i get

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,760
a

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,400
bit more time to get back to rust maybe

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,400
at work even

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,400
nice and how about you ulek

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,120
um i have been playing with crystal a

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,240
lot

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,039
um and i have been working with golang a

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,640
lot

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,520
crystal was especially kind of

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,400
inviting and and nice and we transfer we

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,600
actually even run

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,320
a service um in crystal in production

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,480
i didn't write it but uh some of my

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,440
wonderful colleagues did it

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,000
and we even done some work on kind of

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,799
looking into

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,160
how we can do things operationalizing

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,919
crystals or how we could

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,080
do things like error handling and things

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,120
like that i think crystal is very

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,640
noteworthy for a rubies to look into

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,679
um i didn't honestly i didn't like go

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,200
very much i mean it's it's completely

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,000
workable and it's a really nice language

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,480
i just don't

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,840
i don't really subscribe to the

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,840
philosophy

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,080
and i guess the thing that fascinated me

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,000
more of these

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,080
like in just in general it's not

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,640
necessarily the languages themselves

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,360
but how to in how to do something that

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,760
works well

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,039
in uh that works well in an ecosystem

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,559
like for example what uh

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,400
tatiana was presenting today about

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,440
opengl like imagine you want an

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,039
application

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,600
which needs to put a window on the

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,000
screen and draw a line on the screen

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,360
uh you can use whichever language you

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,840
want and you may

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,760
even be familiar with this language but

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,520
before you get all the libraries and all

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,440
the frameworks on your particular

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,080
operating system to cooperate before you

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,160
figure out

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,360
why the linker doesn't work before you

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,840
figure out why

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,600
why the why the compiling fails all this

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,120
kind of stuff

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,360
you actually spend more time than

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,960
writing the uh the the logic

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,840
in the code itself and what fascinates

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,160
me more than

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,160
languages to be honest is how how can

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,200
this problem be solved like is there

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,360
something that makes

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,880
this ridiculously simpler than it is now

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
like imagine i want the window with a

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,520
button

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,400
in with native os controls what should i

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,160
use

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,760
except electron maybe that's uh

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,760
that's kind of a fascinating topic

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,520
well one question that we asked to our

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
panelists in the in the previous panel

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,440
was

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,000
and that i would love to hear from you

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,520
as well is uh

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,919
you know during this time have you been

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,440
watching a lot of talks and if so

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,440
is there a talk that you would recommend

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,640
that to pass on that you could give a

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,559
shout out to for folks

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,840
it doesn't have to be at this conference

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,039
uh can be at

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,960
other conferences that you've seen

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,159
particular talks that have really moved

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,159
or influenced you in the last

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,159
time

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,480
uh yulik why don't you start us off uh

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,919
i'm trying to remember i yeah so i think

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,320
there i think there is one

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,039
and that was the last talk by sendimetz

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,280
which really

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,200
uh which was really impressive for me

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,039
which kind of revealed the impact

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:57,120
that generations have on uh equality

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,200
equity and uh enablement

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,840
and you know acquisition of wealth in a

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,679
way because for example in in most of

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,159
the the countries where we are located

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,559
you know

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,840
questions like do you do you even get to

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,400
own a property

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,080
when you are at a certain age you know

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,720
where do you go live with your family

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,120
is your job going to be safe in a decade

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
when

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,039
the technologies change and the

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,720
accessibility of technologies changes

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,320
uh things like that i think this was the

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,960
highlight really for me for of the

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,080
recent

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,400
talks i saw that talk it was

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,799
excellent it was a i believe rubyconf

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,720
last year right i think so yeah

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,400
yeah the talk is called lucky you i can

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
highly vouch i can highly recommend it

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,080
it's great

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,360
i'm sorry got excited kier how about you

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,280
is there any talk

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,360
that's been jumping out at you

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,039
um that talk that elix mentioned sounds

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,000
really interesting i would love to watch

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,159
that

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,080
uh i personally haven't um

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,840
watched too many things in maybe last

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,960
six or nine months because this year has

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,600
been kind of crazy for

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,840
for all of us so maybe i'll pass it to

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,840
tom

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,840
oh tom you're still there

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,840
he looks happy ah there you go

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,720
you are

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,159
you're dropping a alright i am

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,760
ah so my

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,679
selfish programmer by jesus uh it sounds

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,000
a lot like what my talk is not about

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,039
about communication it's about it's more

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,360
about how you do

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,840
programming and how you can be practical

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,840
in this kind of development

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:54,080
oops i think the connection might be a

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:58,799
bit off

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:02,880
yeah i think the connection might be a

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:06,080
bit off i i kind of missed it but uh

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,840
we'll see so ramon how are we on time

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,240
how many

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,880
uh questions can we still

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,159
i think we we've got time for one more

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,120
shortish question

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,640
um and i'll make it a a quick one if i

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,360
may

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,440
go ahead if if all goes well

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,919
will i see all of you at eureka last

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,919
next year

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,799
yes that's yes okay cool yeah champion

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,120
it is the one that's going to be in

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,039
helsinki finland right correct

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,799
yeah i used to live there for a few

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,880
years i'm really looking forward to come

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,400
back for the conference and to see

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
all the people from the local ruby

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,240
community that i know from the meetup

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,720
and as well as all the rest of ruby

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,080
friends

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,679
from uh the rest of europe and the royal

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,080
world excellent how about you tom and

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,080
eulek

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,039
i would say i i'm looking forward to it

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,840
i actually bought a ticket last year

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,559
i just couldn't you know uh use that

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,520
ticket so

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,520
i hope it's still valid

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,600
how about you tom yeah if it's safe to

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,919
travel again

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,840
and have large gatherings then i would

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,960
definitely look into it

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,600
excellent excellent right i hope you too

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,400

taking the time to answer our

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
questions it's been an absolute pleasure

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,799
talking to you

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,240
