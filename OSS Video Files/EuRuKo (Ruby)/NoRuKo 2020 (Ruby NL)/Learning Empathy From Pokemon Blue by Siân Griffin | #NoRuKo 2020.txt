Description: 
	Have you ever looked at a bug and wondered why it actually happens? It's easy to chalk it up to sloppy coding but that's almost never the case. In this talk we'll be dissecting a exploit from Pokemon Blue known as the "Missingno" glitch. We'll look at the details of each of the seemingly random bugs behind this exploit. We'll look at why these bugs happened, and the lessons we can apply to our Ruby code more than 20 years later.

Siân Griffin is a former Rails committer, and co-leads the team responsible for crates.io, the package repository for Rust.

Welcome to the #NoRuKo conference. A virtual unconference organized by Stichting Ruby NL.
