	00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,200
we're having quite a discussion here

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,160
about uh uh the choice of pizza and

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,199
basically

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,359
where the the i cannot get over this

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
people here actually want to have

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,119
pineapple on their pizza

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,920
like what i cannot like get over there

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,920
because well

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,160
it's it's it's almost a dinner time so

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,640
we're ordering pizza here for everyone

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,360
is there actually people here ordering

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,800
pizza

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,040
with pineapple don't don't give me that

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,079
look i can't see you there no it's it's

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
not like

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,360
do you have an opinion about this

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,719
because i have

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,520
strong feelings so so my

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,719
my preference is to not have pineapple

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,960
on pizza

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,160
but i i think like we should just let

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
people have their own

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
things that they like you're my next

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,559
best best friend now forever

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,000
like like if people like pineapple on

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,360
pizza they should be allowed to have

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,040
pineapple on pizza i don't like

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,680
like if you're a group of people

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
ordering a pizza get a second pizza one

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,400
without pineapple like problem solved

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,280
right like i

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,600
no no it's like no no you can ask like

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
every random italian person they will

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,600
tell you it's not supposed to be on

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,439
a pizza like no way

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,040
yeah sorry it's like where it's getting

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
that we we're getting very heated

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
discussions here because dinner time

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,960
everyone is grumpy and hungry

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
we're ordering pizza and then this comes

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,759
up

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,360
like it's not supposed to be an issue

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,159
right

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,000
sure i mean like you know i like i sort

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,200
of again i run to like just let people

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,320
have their preferences

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,280
like is that like how is your enjoyment

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,920
of a pizza that

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,479
doesn't have pineapple on it in any way

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,320
reduced by somebody near you who does

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,719
enjoy pineapple on pizza enjoying that

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,719
pizza

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,240
okay coco

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,000
oh well then i'm not having pineapple mo

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,239
pizza

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,319
so tatiana i want to ask you something

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,760
uh uh what do you look forward most in

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,680
in ruby3 i mean

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,520
did you get the chance to watch matt's

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,879
talk

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,120
uh yeah i like i watched mostly the like

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,239
biggest i guess biggest part of it so

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
like uh

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,920
i really like uh looking forward to

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
improve

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,360
performance because like it's uh

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,319
what other communities are picking on us

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,440
every time

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,599
and like we can just like pick on them

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,800
but anyway like a proven performance

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,120
will be

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,090
better for everyone and it'll be i guess

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,239
never enough so

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,120
[Music]

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
same question for you penelope that's a

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
really that's a really interesting

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,239
question i think

00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,640
um so so i have

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,959
i've had like a lot of curiosity for um

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,159
what can be achieved with the ruby type

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,159
profiler

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,760
um like it's it's actually like it's

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,480
really interesting right so like

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,040
um i attended ruby kaigee uh the last

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,800
time

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,239
it occurred like physically in person

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
which is sort of like the first time we

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,120
got to

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,560
see the type profiler and like having

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,800
seen it now evolve

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,560
um like some to me like there's this

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,280
like like the determining what the types

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,560
of the program are at runtime through

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
type profiling

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
is really compelling but like what you

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,599
will notice from max's talk is we don't

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
actually

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
have like an officially sanctioned ruby

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,760
type checker yet

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,000
yeah like ruby like the ruby team did

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,360
not introduce a type checker today

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,200
and they also didn't introduce one at

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,120
ruby kai like as far as i'm aware the

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
ruby team has not really expressed an

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,840
opinion on what form

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,280
uh type checker will take um and as

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,799
someone who is currently in

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,519
the process of building developer

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,239
tooling for the ruby language

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,000
um and actually like uh more importantly

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
like i have some secret

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
in the works after ruby format projects

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,680
that will benefit very

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,519
heavily from type profiling um i'm like

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,120
very curious to see what we do with that

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,879
so that's kind of what's interesting to

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,639
me

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,000
thank you both i'm i'm curious you know

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,240
um

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,360
it's uh it's been a good it's good been

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,600
a good while now

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,560
um we've i've had the opportunity to

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,240
attend a few

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,919
i'm wondering and and and penelope i

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,680
knew i know you were at uh you you

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,000
mentioned you were at brighton ruby

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,280
how's how's the feeling been of of

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,880
online events

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,639
for you overall so okay

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,360
as a speaker doing an online event

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,080
is so much harder than doing an

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,199
in-person

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,320
event like it turns out reading body

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,280
language reading noise reading laughter

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,240
from a crowd is actually like super

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,360
critical

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
uh to uh actually feeling good while

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,360
giving a talk like

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
and just having nothing come back is

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,039
like

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,400
it makes it really difficult um i

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,520
actually it's funny uh

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,160
sean who is speaking later they um

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,400
for rostconf pre-recorded their talk and

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,160
had us all join in a zoom call to be

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,919
their audience so like i actually got to

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
watch their talk early

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,840
and like was part of the virtual

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,440
audience in a zoom call which i thought

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,440
was a really interesting way

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,880
of doing it um but yeah that's tough

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,639
i mean like i'm also a conference

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,560
organizer right um

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,000
and so like it's it's also like it's

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,320
interesting to note like

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,680
definitely fewer people attending um

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,320
fewer people

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
uh submitting talks i have generally

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,600
found so like

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,120
it's also tough it's just like like we

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,240
should be frank this is a really hard

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,000
time for everyone

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,720
right like it's a global pandemic um and

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,919
yeah i don't know i like it i do think

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,240
however it's great

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,600
we're pulling the community together

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,120
right to do these things like

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,720
like doing something for the community

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
is definitely doing better than doing

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,120
nothing and so like for the organizers

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,680
like thank you so much for making this

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,720
happen like this is feels like ruby

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,319
conference-ish

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,039
in a way that is activating those parts

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,639
of my brain and it feels really good

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:24,000
hmm yeah so yeah it weird times uh

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,960
right so um i'm curious tatiana so how

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,479
are these uh

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,680
the these times reading you like uh um

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,199
you have you been working remote uh only

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,039
or have you been going to the office

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,880
once a while or is this like

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,639
i will never go to the office again

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,000
because this is amazing

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:45,759
so how has been how has this pandemic

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,400
been treating you

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,160
so i'm working in gitlab which is like a

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,479
like fully remote company and we don't

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,199
have

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,080
any office and i've been uh working now

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,120
like

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,479
for about two years in uh like from home

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,680
and i found it great and but like we

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,599
have a few our developers here in

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,800
kharkivara leave so like sometimes we

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,039
went together

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,039
for the co-working day and it was like

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,520
it was really nice to see people

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,800
but when this looked down and pandemic

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
starts for me it was like

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,080
yeah okay yeah i still like i'm working

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,400
from home i like

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,160
i still have to go out with my like

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,759
working out my dog so like nothing

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,479
changed for me like everything is the

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,759
same

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,560
but in a few months i find out that like

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
still like hitting me hard because i i

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,080
can't feel like if

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,840
even if i want i can't visit my family

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,560
or my co-workers

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,280
and it's still like it's like it's not

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,160
very good

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,039
like for anyone if like even if my like

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,080
day

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,560
uh style doesn't change like

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,199
any like it doesn't change at all but

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,520
still it's

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,080
it's a it's a bummer i guess for

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,319
everybody

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,400
yeah i can imagine i can imagine i mean

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,639
for i think for all of us it's been

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:06,560
something similar if not you know

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:09,039
it's tricky um so

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,039
i i i really appreciated that you both

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,000
came on today and and gave us your your

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,800
wonderful talks

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,080
um i want to throw in a cheeky question

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,840
if i may as uh

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,680
folks as you as you might know this is

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,360
all happening live

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,080
uh however um penelope

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,360
alluded to this with with sean's talk

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,440
some conferences are doing

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,120
pre-recorded talks while we're doing

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,560
this these live events

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,839
i'm curious for you as both

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,519
uh uh participants and as attendees

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,360
what's what's your preferred between

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,560
live and pre-recorded talks for these

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,279
online events

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,279
uh penelope so

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,360
it the answer is it depends actually

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,080
um there's like there's like a handful

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
of factors

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,839
right um so for example like if most of

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,880
the other talks

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,800
for a conference are going to be live

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,160
like i want to sort of like fill in with

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
the rest of the set

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,160
breit and ruby the talks were all

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,920
pre-recorded um

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
and like the interesting thing about

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,560
that for example is like you can

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,080
do multiple takes right i and like what

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,160
i actually did is i sent

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,440
andy the organizer of the conference

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,600
like a bundle i was like

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,800
like here's four takes like do whatever

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,440
you want with them right

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,560
and i i don't know if andy edited them

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,360
together or like

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,080
took one contiguous take um right it

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,000
also like

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,200
sort of let us iterate so like i sent

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,080
like a like

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,640
rough version and then took feedback and

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
it's like

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,000
there are some advantages and that you

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,399
can do like many cycles

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,160
the talk you see today is actually like

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,480
very directly adapted from the break

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,480
movie

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
um

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,560
uh i have at least found from the live

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,920
experience and so like

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,399
pre-recording is kind of like

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,399
compressing that giving multiple times

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,760
i have experience so like it's

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,120
trade-offs right i don't know that one

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,440
is better than the other i think for a

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,440
trade-off

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,760
so we have uh um we have learned that

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,959
we can make art with the program

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,640
programming languages draw

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:30,800
paint but do you know that you can also

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,760
make music or writing code

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,959
so i don't know that that uh um last

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,000
year we had uh

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,640
we had a talk well basically

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,560
it's it's like how to make uh music with

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,320
the programming language

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,920
and i think ramon maybe you can tell us

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,519
a bit more about our

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,880
nice musical uh intermetal

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,880
absolutely uh however um right

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,839
uh sorry to tell you they were a little

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,079
bit ahead of schedule

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:05,040
it's it's 5 30 right now

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,560
um cest so i would say let's keep going

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,640
with our panel discussion

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
until six o'clock uh if that's fine with

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,720
both of you

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,320
um until we have our musical break

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,760
with nerd disco and half bite so sorry

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,760
uh tatiana no sure no problem i was

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,959
30 minutes ahead of schedule no problem

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,800
so uh yeah tatiana um i i wanted to

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,480
ask you about what your opinion was

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,079
about pre-recorded versus

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,800
live talks in online conferences

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,839
so like basically for me personally it's

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,600
much easier to

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,839
do it live because like uh

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,360
whisper recorded like i've once have

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,720
been trying to

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,920
um get a if you

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,920
uh learn a video and uh

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,240
it's took like forever like the one

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,800
video to collect 15. it's like a long 15

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,639
minutes

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,240
and it took me again two hours because

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,240
you were taking takes like

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,360
better better better and it's like takes

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,399
a lot of time

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,320
but uh at least i don't know

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,440
uh like i spent a lot to say that it's

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,000
much easier to

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,279
do it live like with a uh with the

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,920
audience because you can

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,240
read by the language and you can like uh

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,399
see the people's faces and

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,920
uh you can understand like either are

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,279
they understand what you're talking

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,720
about or not

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,600
and uh i don't know at least this uh

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,279
when you're doing live online at least

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,560
this is give you some

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,399
uh notion of like some urgency that it's

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,720
like it's right now and it's not you you

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,519
can't

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,440
like undo it so it's like a special

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,760
feeling when you're doing some public

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
talks

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,839
yeah for sure uh no i don't know if you

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,279
wanted to add something penelope you

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,920
kind of look like

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,360
yeah i was just gonna say like i mean

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,000
like i agree

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,560
fundamentally like doing it live kind of

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,240
feels

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
most similar to getting up on a

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,079
conference stage right and that's a

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,959
feeling i've been missing

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,079
uh like like before the pandemic i think

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,320
i spoke at like eight

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,000
or nine ruby commenters the year before

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,160
right um and this

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,680
uh like this this year like it's it's

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,160
two um

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,040
maybe it will be three or four by the

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,760
end of the year

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:26,079
right so like it's a big difference

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,399
okay so um if you could change

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,440
so tatiana for your question if you

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,839
could change

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,680
like one thing about ruby what would

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,240
that be

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,720
it's a really a hard question i don't

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,160
know

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,839
uh so what would i maybe add something

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,600
or remove something yeah formatter will

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:54,000
be actually really nice to have so

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,000
uh no i don't know like uh

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,440
i guess i'm the person that like if i

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,639
know is like

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,079
if i know that this stuff works this way

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:07,519
so like for me it's easier to follow

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,600
the standard than like complains that

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,959
i'm missing some features that then

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,720
don't have

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,120
so like i don't actually i don't know

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,279
how to answer the question

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,800
how about you uh penelope if you could

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,839
change one thing in ruby

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,880
remove add change

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,600
yeah so like my problem is i have like

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,079
way more than one right um as as

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,160
somebody

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,680
so like this comes back to something i

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,399
said in my talk which is that like

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,880
the the grammar of the ruby language is

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,000
extremely complicated like the way

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,279
you actually write and express like ruby

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,959
programs there are so many different

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,120
ways to express the same

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,639
thing like and we're adding more right

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,600
like mats is adding right hand

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,040
assignment

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,079
to ruby in three like um

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,680
like my hot take on that is it's a bad

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,920
idea and we shouldn't do it

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,880
um like like just just like

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,560
fundamentally because like

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,240
so and so here's how i think about this

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,279
and this is actually something um

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,600
a friend of mine uh james coughlin

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,320
helped give me some real clarity on

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
a while back which is that like um if

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,199
you add

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,680
features to the language that don't give

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,199
you any new capabilities that aren't

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,079
more powerful

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,000
than existing constructs like you're

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,360
effectively increasing the complexity of

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,639
the implementation of the language for

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,680
no additional

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,639
benefit to the folks writing in it right

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,199
and so if you if you made me pick one

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,079
thing

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,199
i would change about ruby i would remove

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,920
the one nine

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,800
hash syntax with the the like colon at

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,880
the end

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,199
uh and go back to only having hash

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,279
rockets uh which is like this is one of

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,279
the most controversial takes

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,279
in like all of all of being a ruby

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,079
developer is that hash rockets are good

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,120
actually

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,040
and that like the um the one nine style

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,839
syntax where you have the colon

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,240
at the end and then an expression is is

00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,920
is

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,839
bad actually because like if you think

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,360
about it right when that syntax was

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,040
introduced we didn't

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,720
gain an ability to do something we

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,040
couldn't previously do

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,320
like um we could always put simple keys

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,839
in hashes before

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,839
it just made it so there's slightly

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,680
fewer characters to do that

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,440
and like the the argument i hear a lot

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,800
is that it reads more like json except

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,720
that it's not actually compatible with

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,600
json because if you put quotes there

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,000
it produces a symbol and not a string um

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,240
and

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,079
so like everything in that family of

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,440
like the new

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,800
one nine style hash syntax is just like

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,639
and calling it new at this point is

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,040
ridiculous right because one nine

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,639
came out what like seven or eight years

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,199
ago maybe more at this point

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,839
uh it's it's new to me in the island a

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,880
ruby

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,600
that didn't have that feat but like

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,240
yeah so like it's and to sort of move up

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
a level it's

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
it's stuff like that it's things in the

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,279
language where

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,120
we didn't gain the ability to do

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,279
anything new by adding it

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,639
i think a stuff that we could take out

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,240
and it would be just fine

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,240
right of course we would break people's

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
programs and max doesn't want to break

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,000
people's programs so we're never going

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,760
to get

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,919
that but that's what i would remove

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,839
actually i i know works like after

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,839
vanilla patoka actually know what i want

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,520
to remove and i i would love to remove

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,360
one like single quotes

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,559
because like we have double quotes and

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,319
like insects so

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,760
every it's stuck it's confusing every

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,039
time it's like sleeping to the merch

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,880
request and you like

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,400
you start like for single quotes when

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,080
you add parameters string

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,919
and you have to change it and like you

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,039
have to like in like in the other

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,840
direction

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,480
and it's just like please change use

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960
different

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
chords like in your mod request review

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,200
and like it doesn't

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,640
provide any like it's a lot of hustle

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,760
but it doesn't provide any

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,120
like reasonable value for all of us so

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,440
so tatiana

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,600
uh i will be pleased to tell you that

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,360
ruby format replaces single quotes with

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,400
double quotes everywhere

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,320
just like like in fact all all string

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,799
literals apart from hair docs

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,320
uh ruby format normalizes them to being

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,280
double quoted so like if you do like

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,080
percent

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,039
is it percent q or percent w or whatever

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,039
the like weird

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,480
syntax for starting a string is like it

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,360
will also normalize those to being

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,280
double quoted

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,600
um and so like ruby format takes an

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,160
extremely hard line stance on this which

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,360
is that

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,559
double quotes are the right way to

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,559
express strings in ruby

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,880
well there you go today the problem

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,880
solved

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,120
you know in the chat today i've actually

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,679
seen when when matt was mentioning

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
um the or when matt showed some some

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,120
hash rockets for the

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,440
for the right side uh right right

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,760
alignment assignment sorry i'm i'm

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,360
messing it up but i was i was actually

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,880
kind of surprised to see that folks were

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,720
were pretty excited to see hash rockers

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,240
like hash rock it's hard emojis so

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,679
i was like okay people do like that

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,480
i kind of came on ruby after the after 1

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,640
9 so i got

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,640
used to the to the dub to the dub to the

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,600
colon but uh

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,640
but anyway yeah it's uh it's interesting

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
to see

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,080
i mean i mean so like i have i have sort

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,840
of like

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,559
i have questions about that so like like

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,600
for example in a in a hash literal it's

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,520
completely valid

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,400
to say like uh like i think now you can

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,440
say

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
like some ex like open parenthesis some

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,840
expression

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
fat arrow variable name close

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,840
parenthesis

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,760
fat arrow value and that that will work

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,120
um because of like how the ruby grammar

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,280
is structured like

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,640
um right hand side assignment will be an

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,400
expression and then like

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,640
that expression if you put wrap it in

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
parentheses can go in a hash key

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,840
and like so like and this is what i mean

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,480
right um

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,280
like if we're adding capabilities to the

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,360
language let's

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,520
look not make sure they introduce like

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,000
new ways of being extremely confusing

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,960
and

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,840
my guess is uh this will end up being

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,120
one that people

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,960
tend not to use

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,480
thank you that's i i really appreciate

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,760
the the the candor

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,240
and and like the question coming from

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:10,159
from your opinions

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,440
i i'm well known for being sorry

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,799
i was just gonna say i'm well known for

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,159
being someone who has strong opinions

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,159
about ruby styling

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,840
i mean i'm inventing a tool to enforce

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,039
my opinions on ruby styling on other

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,880
people so like

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,080
of course i have strong opinions about

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,159
it

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,440
well it also kind of sounds like you

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,200
you've been coding

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,039
like forever i mean how long how did you

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,760
how long have you been coding and how

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,840
did you why ruby

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:41,440
yeah so so that is a question in two

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,960
parts um i started programming when i

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,640
was like 12 or 13. uh in

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:52,080
java 1.2 um

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,919
which uh yeah uh probably probably dates

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,400
and ages me a little bit

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,840
um and so i did that like i learned some

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,400
python some haskell

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,200
some see like like i i was fascinated by

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,440
computers from

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,919
the earlier stage um there is in fact a

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,640
photo of me as a baby playing with the

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,840
uh ibm pc portable that my parents had

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,960
at home

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,360
um and yeah so like

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,880
uh the way i came to ruby is like it's

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,200
kind of an interesting story

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
i was um taking a web applications

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,280
course in university

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,000
it was like here are some languages with

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,159
frameworks

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,919
and i picked ruby on rails and then they

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,720
were like you must write automated

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,080
testing for

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,280
this web application you're developing

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,840
because they were like trying to teach

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,440
us

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,280
like good software development practices

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,840
or something i guess um and i was like

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,440
okay so let's take a look at aspect

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,000
and then i started running into bugs in

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,360
arsbac um and so

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
that's actually how i ended up becoming

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,640
an aspect committer is basically like

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,760
sending bug fixes

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,080
to the aspect tracker from

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,360
while i was in university building my

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,600
university rails

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,600
application uh so yeah that's the story

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,240
wow ever since you were 12 wow and how

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,440
about you tatiana

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,840
so actually my first language was kind

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,480
of embarrassing it was visual basic

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,360
uh but it's not my fault this my mom

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,799
told me uh

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,799
teach me not embarrassing at all

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,799
but i was actually supposed to i wanted

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,840
to be a game developer

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:25,200
and i was really like into it

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,400
when on during universes universe

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,880
tears but one day actually i discovered

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,799
like

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,320
it's also quite funny story how it

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,720
discovered about ruby

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,240
and uh i found out there is like a

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,159
company there search for

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,640
like junior developers and they are like

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,240
close like the next uh

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,280
places from my house so i decided like

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,039
it would be nice to like

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,440
have a job there because it's like easy

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,200
to go and they were actually searching

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,799
for developers on ruby and i

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,640
actually tried like what is actually

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,120
exactly this language

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,760
and i'll start like uh reading the

00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,600
syntax

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,840
and i really love it and i like because

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,159
i was white on the

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,880
our slogans that it's like a best

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,080
friend's

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,720
best friend for a developer and since

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,880
then i've

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,440
like uh and actually the job was on um

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,159
uh into web development and so i was

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,000
like

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,679
also with rails and i've just like i was

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,159
really i was impressed by syntax and i

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,320
really love it so i just uh

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
forget about uh game design and i

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,520
switched to

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,880
computer networks because i didn't know

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,480
like anything about

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,559
about it at that point of time and i

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,039
decided it would be really fun and it's

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,000
still

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,039
really fun and i didn't get that job but

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
i get another one

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:47,679
and uh since then i'm like a

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,799
happy ruby developer wow

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,039
but but okay so so initially a game

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,720
development so so what is your favorite

00:23:53,039 --> 00:24:00,559
game actually uh my favorite game

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:04,159
actually uh the last one i really liked

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:07,840
uh it was um

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,720
sorry i i've like i i didn't manage to

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,440
like pass it

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,000
on playstation so i've just forget the

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,559
name

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,320
but i like i really like a fan of

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,760
adventure games so like

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,400
i guess siberia was my like best like

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,400
uh i really loved it so much uh when i

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,720
was a kid

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,880
and now these days you you also play

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,320
games nowadays

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:36,640
uh nuts not so

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,640
like not frequently but sometimes

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,799
awesome penelope are you like

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:48,400

playstation or yeah i play i play a

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,480
decent amount of video games

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,400
it's it varies um but recently i've been

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,559
playing a lot of factorio

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,480
um and a lot of a game called monster

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,600

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,799
it's a card roguelike and i see ramon is

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,559

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,880
yeah ramon is very excited i get excited

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,880
easily

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,440
oh that's that's that's that's excellent

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,799
i think you know especially now that

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,799
we're spending a lot of time inside

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,720
you know it's a great a great way to

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,240
keep yourself busy and i think uh

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,919
i really like that nowadays people are

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,279

and and free to share their their their

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,120
hobbies when it comes to this sort of

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,240
thing um it's really helped me

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,480
you know come out of my shell and put

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,520
you know where the my hobbies with pride

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,559
as well

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,120
um that said uh i'd love to hear you

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,640
know

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,720
mentioning penelope you mentioned that

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,679
you were doing a little bit of rust yay

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,880
um i'm curious are you are both a

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,320
question for both of you but i'll start

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,480
with penelope are you doing any

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,000
uh any other programming languages that

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,120
you've been dabbling with that you

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,520
want to share with us a little bit yeah

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,559
so like like the answer the answer to

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,320
the question is complicated and

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,679
multifaceted um

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,799
in my job i do a lot of ruby

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,240
and some go um so so

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,159
i i like uh i'm actually in in my

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,320
not previous job but the one before i

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,760
did a lot of work in in go

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,840
as well so i've been programming a lot

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,720
of go um ruby

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,240
like like 90 of all the code in ruby

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,200
format is written in rust

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,279
so like obviously rust and um also

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,480
actually some of ruby format is written

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,159
in c um because the like the ruby

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,799
interpreter is written in c

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,159
uh we have to connect like the ruby

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,039
interpreter to rust

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,039
somehow to do that

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,679
um

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,400
very easily this is this now a dog

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,799
conference um no uh so we have to write

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,279
some c

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,720
code to integrate the ruby interpreter

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,679
into the rust program

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,600
so i also like program a bunch of c um

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,000
those are like the main languages i work

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,880
in

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,960
in a daily basis uh like javascript

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,720
every once in a while i have

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,480
some experience i wouldn't say i'm good

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,480
at javascript but like

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,960
i get along i think that's that's true

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,000
for a lot of us um

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,039
and then like i i'm fluent in a in a

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,240
long list

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,320
of languages um i think perhaps the

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,799
weirdest one that i'm i'm fluent in that

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,360
people

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,799
never expect is haskell uh i have i have

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,360
built some truly large haskell programs

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,320
uh in my time and that has always been a

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,360
really interesting

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,720
experience oh thanks that's that's

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,960
that's really interesting to hear

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,960
um how about you tatiana have you been

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,080
messing around in other languages and

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,880
got strong opinions for us no i actually

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,559
don't

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,039
have strong opinions i'm like

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,760
fair enough yeah i'm just like i'm

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,960
balancing against this group

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,679
so uh but yeah i'm looking basically

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,240
like for the like for the daily life

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,159
they

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,360
like i'm written um in uh ruby

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,159
and uh we say in ruby i guess we should

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
i should say

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,360
rails because it's i'm working on the

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,919
rails application

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,399
and uh yeah like um the goal is the

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,919
second

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:23,200
uh second language that we used in uh

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,559
for writing our tools in my team but uh

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,080
like right now like mostly it's ruby but

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:33,679
i've been uh like as i said i was

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,880
written a lot in c sharp uh c plus plus

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,559
yeah and a bit of lisp i guess

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:45,840
so something like that nice

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,840
yeah and really really poor javascript

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,039
i understand i feel you feel right

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,520
yeah well thank you both um so i'm i'm

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,240
curious

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,799
again staying in spending lots of time

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,120
um

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,320
online and and indoor and and indoors

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,039

participating in in the uh

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,159

uh publish it online somewhere and

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,320
i guess i would love to promote ruby

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,279
meditation events which is happening

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,399

uh organized next

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,399
lovely and then on my side

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,240
like um so

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,600
there's like since the pandemic has

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,880
begun uh

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,559
i would say like the

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:33,200
new speaker i was not aware of

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:36,320
prior to like this is um brian cantrell

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,440
who is not actually speaking about ruby

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,279
subjects at all uh brian uh sort of

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,360
comes from the systems and ops

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,880
world and gives these like very

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,080
compelling talks

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,200
about uh taking the unix philosophy

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,640
and applying it to cloud um which as as

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,320
a reliability engineer as someone who

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,640
leads teams of engineers building

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,080
complex cloud systems is like

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,240
fascinating to me

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,159
um so like if if folks are sort of in

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,039
the ops reliability

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,480
um like cognitive systems engineering

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,039
space i would highly recommend

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,320
looking up brian and bingeing on his

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,720
talks he has like

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,159
a big archive which is really nice and

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,960
then um

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,720
i will give a shout out to sean's talk

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,120
um i have seen it

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,559
it is great if you played pokemon as a

inspires you

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,919

i totally agree yes katrina

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,039
uh how about you uh penelope who is your

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,679
community hero irwin

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,559
yeah i of course i of course agree on uh

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,600
katrina owen

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,799
i think she's fantastic um sandy mats

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,519
is is a big name that comes uh

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,720
forward to me as someone like i look up

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,159
to you and i had

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,279
great conversations with over the years

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,159
uh i think perhaps uh

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,360
lesson lesser known figure um who is

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,960
having an outsized

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,240
impact on uh the ruby language

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,720
is uh mamey uh yusuke endo

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,399
uh is his full name but he goes by mommy

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,519
everywhere on the internets

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,240
he's a ruby core team member he does a

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,039
lot of work

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,240
on pushing forward uh the actual

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,279
internals of the

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,760
ruby language and not a ton of folks uh

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,279
know his name but that's uh someone who

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,559
is less well-known but i think is is

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,000
very important

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,679
and i guess i guess perhaps also

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,919
actually um eileen

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,960
you should tell uh probably deserves to

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,399
mention here as well

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,919
like it's funny because like eileen is

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,600
an extremely good friend of mine and so

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,559
it's like hard to describe as like a

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,679
hero

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,399
but um eileen basically single-handedly

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,040
has been working on the major and

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,040
important

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,560
feature development in ruby on rails for

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,240
the last several years

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,520
um there have been other folks who've

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,399
been sort of like contributing and

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,000
maintaining

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,240
but like eileen has implemented some of

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,480
the headline features and the new

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,760
rails versions and the work she's doing

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,040
is just so important

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,560
for our community oh yeah

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,320
yes oh for sure that

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,839
i know you're still since you're on the

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,599
panel

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:44,960
oh uh oh okay you're a ruby hero

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,040
who is my ruby hero oh my goodness

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,839
um i just put you on the spot right

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,839
there

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,720
i i guess um that that all of you

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,640
haven't mentioned already

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,400
um you know i have massive respect for

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,359
people like katrina and

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,960
and yusuke and and and and and so on and

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,240
um

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,960
and and and of course i lean and uh

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,760
well i think for me what what what's

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,000
really been

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,040
been focusing for me is what where what

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,359
the what the

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,040
what the people come from making the the

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,680
ruby community

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,200
uh better uh i guess i would give a

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,640
shout out to folks like uh

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,520
kaya santro who uh gave a talk at yuruko

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,079
last year

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,200
uh she's running code the code curious

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,320
formerly known as

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,720
uh rails girls berlin group in in in

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,000
in berlin and she's she and amer who's

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,359
another ruby hero of mine

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,359
and is speaking at this conference um

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,440
they've both been doing such a fantastic

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,839
job of keeping this this this

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,560
this need to learn this urge to to to

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,400
cooperate

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,320
going for me and that's that's something

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,520
that's that's been mattering a lot for

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,839
me lately

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,760
um just just keeping going keeping

00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:02,560
learning staying yeah

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:06,000
and yourself writer how about you hey

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,480
oh well actually it's it's uh um for me

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,880
the the the heroes are actually the

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,000
people who keep the community going so

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,440
it's not just one

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
particular person but it's like uh

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,640
the the the people will have this this

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,079
passion

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,440
this this love for ruby and um wants to

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,720
keep there and they want to keep

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,640
connecting people

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:31,760
uh helping them out so organizing

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,839
also organizing meetups

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,800
and and getting people together

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,440
connecting them

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,640
basically they i consider them my heroes

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,040
because i learn

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,240
a lot from them not i mean not just the

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,440
organizing part but

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,720
like the events themselves um so

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,280
so for for me basically the the

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,480
the and i get all my inspiration from

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,079
from them as well

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,599
as in as in uh um like how would you

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,320
how do you how do you if i have a

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,400
question about a certain topic and and

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,520
i would like to learn more about it and

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,240
then maybe

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,079
um the community members can help me

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,119
with certain questions or get many

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,240
contact with

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,680
and um so for me basically

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,160
um within ruby i i find that the

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,280
all the community people they're my

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,000
heroes

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,640
that so it's not just one name it's all

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,040
of them

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,760
sorry i know i know how you feel it's

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,880
hard to

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,000
to pin it down so um

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,240
i think we're just about coming up to

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,200
our last question for today

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,560
so one thing that that i found in my

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,320
experience is when people

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,720
are starting out as programmers and they

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,040
ask me things like

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,960
what is what is the perfect what is the

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,200
lang the programming language that will

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,640
solve all of my needs that i that i will

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,760
spend all of my time learning as my

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,800
first language

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,480
and then i'm set for life and i it's

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,560
kind of i kind of struggle to

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,560
to to answer this question so i'm

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,560
curious how how do you feel about this

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,240
i could write a whole talk on this

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,160
question um

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,599
i think okay so there's like an easy

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,760
answer and a bad answer

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,359
and like a more complicated answer the

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,200
easy answer is

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,119
if you want one language that will

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,800
probably give you the easiest learning

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,920
and the most leverage

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,880
javascript is probably the right one

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,520
it's accessible on on server on client

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,920
um

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,200
the community is is very strong like

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,640
great ecosystem

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,400
and there's great there's great learning

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,480
resources right like and also

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,079
like you can keep someone javascript

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,520
from a thing they already use every day

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,079
to browse facebook and twitter their

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
browser

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,440
right you can keep some javascript in

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,720
the browser without them ever having to

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,960
leave which is trickier with other

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,400
languages

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,000
the more complicated answer to that

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,359
question is that there is no silver

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,480
bullet there is no ideal programming

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,960
language and everything is

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,480
in technology as a trade-off if you're

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,320
extremely new

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,960
you your brain literally is not capable

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,320
of even

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,640
seeing what the trade-offs are yet um

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,520
and so you can pick basically any

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,480
language

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,320
and have as much like effectively like

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,680
within orders of magnitude as much

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,160
leverage as any other

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,520
like if you pick cobol you're probably

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,880
going to have a worse time than if you

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,240
pick javascript right

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,520
like nobody's really programming in

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,200
cobol anymore it's hard to get the

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,079
compilers there's not a great eco but

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,760
like honestly

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,359
learning how to program in cobol and

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,359
then transmuting that knowledge out to

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,839
something like javascript or ruby

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,200
like it's actually like there's that's

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,760
already gonna have brought the learning

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,680
curve

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,119
down right and here i'm obviously using

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,240
cobol as a straw man

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,280
like nobody should be learning cobol in

00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,920
2020.

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,200
so so like so like like my sort of

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,000
response to that question is it's a

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,160
badly formed

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,079
question like that because the answer is

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,960
the answer is no there is no like one

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,240
language

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,839
that will solve all of your problems

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,280
forever in every context um

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,000
and so this is where i come to like

00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,000
javascript's extremely pragmatic answer

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,839
for a whole variety of reasons as to

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,040
like what's a good language to

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,280
start learning in that said

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,560
like obviously i'm a ruby developer i

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,839
like a lot of ruby

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,480
it would be nice if there were more ruby

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:16,000
developers in the world but like

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,160
yeah thanks a lot

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,280
i think i i agree with a lot of that i

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,119
think it

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,520
it is like that like when you said

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,480
silver bullet i was like that's the word

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,680
um yeah sorry to tiana how about you do

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,440
you have a

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,720
an answer or an opinion that you would

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,640
share

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,000
yeah actually i'm stronger agrees that

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,200
there is no like

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,880
one language to rule them all and like

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,880
we have to carefully

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,480
choose like the tools for every task

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,760
that we work on

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,359
and uh like like we are like like with

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,839
experience yeah you hear you really like

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,839
you

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,880
you know these traders and you actually

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,000
can understand

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,800
for which like task you can apply the

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,280
riddle like this one or another one but

00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,880
uh

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,440
talking about like the first language

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,599
that the like

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,720
like new developer should learn i don't

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,400
have actually this

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,560
answer for it i remember that we have

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,079
like big discussion in the university

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,280
like a long time ago

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,240
like what um our professor like uh like

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,560
we discuss it with

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,359
what our like uh students on their first

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,240
like a year

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,359
what uh london cruises they should learn

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,480
first like

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,520
uh like on which they should

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,359
run uh write their program and i still

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,480
didn't know because i was like my first

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,640
language university was c and i

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,760
like i still grateful because like i

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,680
spent few months

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,040
with like i have no idea what i'm doing

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,680
i was just like

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,319
copying stuff and it's magically worked

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,720
and sometimes

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,800
it doesn't work and i didn't know why

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,560
but in few months i realized and still

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,280
this knowledge helped me to like

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,640
basically helps me to understand how

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,119
actually everything works

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,680
and it still helped me to write uh

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,880
better

00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,040
programs in ruby but uh

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,000
i don't know it depends i guess ruby

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,680
could be a good choice

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,079
if you want to just quickly start and

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,720
jump in and see how like get some

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,640
results

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,079
like be encouraged to learn more when

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,599
you get some results

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,079
but uh i guess like i guess my answer

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,200
will be

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,720
not learn one but learn different and

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,319
understand what's the difference between

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,200
them

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,680
wonderful thank you thank you so much
