Description: 
	We all love our Sidekiq’s and our Resque’s. But they do let us down sometimes. Not because they are bad, but because the queueing theory is limiting us. There is a way to break out of the madness though - let’s explore how to get our job queues under control. 

Kir Shatrov is a platform engineer at Shopify where he works on scalability and reliability of one of the world’s largest ecommerce platforms. When not into working, Kir enjoys cooking, gastronomic tourism (he even has a GitHub repo with his favourite spots!) and exploring London on the bike.
Julik Tarkhanov is a software developer at WeTransfer where he is responsible for the backend components of the Transfer product, enabling effortless transfer of creative ideas. Prior to WeTransfer he worked in the visual effects industry creating images that inspire and befuddle. On his free time he explores weird user interfaces and plays trumpet.
