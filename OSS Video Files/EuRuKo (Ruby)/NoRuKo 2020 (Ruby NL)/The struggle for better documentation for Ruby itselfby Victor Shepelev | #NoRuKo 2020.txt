Title: The struggle for better documentation for Ruby itselfby Victor Shepelev | #NoRuKo 2020

Description: 
	Ruby is known to be "complex language for writing simple code" and "designed to make programmers happy". Yet while those principles are fully embodied in the language spirit and logic, the documentation is traditionally more problematic, especially for newcomers who are already programming-literate and expect a quick and deep dive. Let's talk about several aspects of language and standard library documentation, its history, current state, and the future, expectations it should ideally meet and some unfortunate road bumps. 

Victor Shepelev is an Ukrainian programmer and poet with twelve years of programming experience and fifteen years of Ruby programming. Working at Verbit.ai, mentoring students (including Google Summer of Code-2016-2018, as a mentor for SciRuby organization), developing open source (Ruby Association Grant 2015).
