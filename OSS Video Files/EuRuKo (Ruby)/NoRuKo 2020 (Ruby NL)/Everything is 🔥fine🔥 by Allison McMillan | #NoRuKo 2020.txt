the developer dilemma is do you prefer

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
to work remote

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,840

much for having me

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,960
so today we're living in a completely

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,079
different world than we were only a few

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,159
months ago

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,680
and the choices that we're making the

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,720
way that that we're living our

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,399
day-to-day lives

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,720
everything has changed and it all

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,119
changed really quickly

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,360
this new way of living is tough for

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,079
everyone

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,799
and as we navigate this pandemic around

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,119
the world

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,399
you don't have to look very far to see

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,000
that working parents

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:06,640
and mothers in particular are drowning

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,759
article after article after article

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,720
highlights the long-term effects we're

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,959
expected to wear

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,959
so many different hats right now i mean

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,520
even as i'm delivering this talk

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,520
i am waiting for information about my

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,200
daughter's preschool reopening which is

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,360
supposed to start next week

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,080
um and my son's virtual kindergarten

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,720
schedule login etc i'm sure all of that

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,599
will go

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,000
amazingly um and doing all of this while

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,319
working doing grocery shops for my mom

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,480
navigating our overall family's health

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,440
and well-being and more

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,360
every day is a sprint of decision making

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,560
and new situations that i need to make

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,840
decisions about or react to

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,879
but this is also not a sprint it's a

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,519
marathon

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,480
and you can only run that fast for so

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,000
long

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,800
before burning out i have two wonderful

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,959
children

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
a five-year-old and a two-year-old they

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,120
have both become

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,080
very good at math squares

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,319
and uh like my intro set i'm also i work

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,400
at github as a director of engineering

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,480
i work on code spaces and a variety of

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,879
other teams i'm on the board of ruby

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,879
central where the cfp is currently open

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,720
to speak at ruby conf

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,560
a mozilla tech speaker and i run a

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,360
podcast called parent driven development

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,440
about being a parent in tech

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,280
now not all of the problems that we're

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,280
seeing are completely new

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,319
uh when i first went back to work after

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,959
having my son

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,239
it was after only six weeks and it was

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,159
intense

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,480
there was so much that i was struggling

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,640
with and the isolation of being a parent

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
in tech the challenges of balancing it

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,920
all

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,239
um if i'm being really honest there are

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,120
times in the last handful of years where

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,519
i just wasn't sure if i could remain in

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,080
tech

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
and be a successful mom i thought about

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,920
leaving tech more than once

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,840
and going back to different fields or

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,560
positions that i could do well or could

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,040
do a little bit more on autopilot

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,439
you see cute pictures of parent life or

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,480
kids on facebook or instagram

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,480
but it's not always like that and for me

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,120
especially in the early days of both

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,479
kids it wasn't usually like that

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,440
it was hard and tiring and frustrating

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,919
it was also amazing and encompassing and

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,919
sometimes really lonely

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,840
i reached out to other parents to ask

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,800
questions which led to me putting

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,759
together a survey

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,919
so here's a little bit of what i found

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,960
in an industry that values open source

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,280
contributions

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,040
github as your resume and keeping up to

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
date with the most recent programming

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,120
developments

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,360
parents were already struggling

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,440
they were challenged by job interviews

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,080
that sent that sent home code challenges

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,919
saying

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,040
don't worry it should only take four to

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,040
six hours of focus time to complete

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,759
do you know when the last time that i

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,160
had six straight hours of focused time

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,520
outside of my work day was i think it

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,000
was about five and a half years ago

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,440
before my son was born

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,320
and they were also challenged with

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,880
staying sharp a study from outlet baby

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
care

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,160
found that parents lose a total of 44

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,800
days

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,919
of sleep in their child's first year and

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,600
a newer study

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,120
found that parents are sleep deprived

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,000
for six years

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,479
after they have a child and again all of

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,960
this

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
was pre-pandemic where at least we could

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,560
head to our easier

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,360
day jobs when i asked if having children

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,600
helped or hurt their career only a small

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,919
portion of respondents self-identifying

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,919
as

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,240
fathers said that it had hurt their

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,639
career they felt it either helped or had

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,120
a neutral impact

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,199
about sixty percent of respondents uh

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,400
self-identifying as women though it said

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,880
that having children

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,639
hurt their career and even more said

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
that it didn't hurt their career but it

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,400
changed it

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,080
many women said that it slowed their

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,240
career affecting their overall

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,639
trajectory and growth potential

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,160
now i venture to say that those changes

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,280
are actually in fact

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,080
hurting mothers careers so here's the

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,919
total breakdown

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,440
of parents based on if they felt that

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,520
having a child helped

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,240
hurt had no impact or both helped and

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,240
hurt their career

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,160
and here are those same choices based on

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,520
mom identifying answers or data

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,319
identifying answers

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,800
so as you can see well in this last one

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,960
the pieces are pretty even

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,639
um when you break it down it's much

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,479
different and one thing that i do want

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,240
to note here is that i don't have this

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,400
information breakdown for

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,360
non-binary folks or for respondents who

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,199
don't identify

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960
as a mother or a father because i don't

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,440
have enough survey results yet from that

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,280
population

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,039
and this data is backed up by additional

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,199
research this 2018

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,080
study on children and gender inequality

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,240
in denmark

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,639
shows these results based on gender and

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,880
earnings

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,639
so given all of those challenges i

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,319
wanted to talk about some solutions or

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,720
some things that might help especially

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,199
now

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,400
in these in these coveted times so we'll

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,440
start with some company based solutions

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,319
first allowing flexible creative or

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,120
unconventional work options so i'm going

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,080
to mostly

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,319
bypass remote work for now since many of

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
us

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,080
are working remotely but if you're not

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,199
actively offering that already it's

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,880
definitely a must-have

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,639
many parents right now aren't just

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,000
dealing with regular benefits of working

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,840
remote right like it's not

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,440
just having to take into account time

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,759
for commuting etc

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,080
but even for places where schools and

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,000
child care facilities are reopening

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,560
they're reopening with an incredible

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
amount of rules and restrictions

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,080
and i'll say that i'm all for these

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,479
roles we tend to be

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,599
more cautious than than some of the

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,560
folks around us

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,479
um but i also realize the burden of

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,440
needing to keep a toddler home

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,960
when they just have a runny nose like if

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,960
my daughter ends up going back to

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,720
preschool i'm sort of wondering if

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,560
she'll even be there at all between the

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,840
months of october and march when a runny

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,680
nose is pretty much the norm

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,160
and for those with school-age children

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,720
at home even older kids need some sort

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,039
of extra attention or supervision

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,400
and that need increases the younger the

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,879
child is

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,319
most adults i know have a difficult time

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
spending hours per day

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,080
in zoo meetings and so we need to be

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,720
empathetic with our little ones

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,639
and with the parents supporting them and

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,879
what creative working solutions or

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,880
hours looks like will be different for

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,479
different parents and kids at different

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,399
ages

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,599
for companies looking at what can be

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,959
offered

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,039
there's no one-size-fits-all here

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,800
second companies can take a much more

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,720
proactive role in creating support

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,880
systems

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
a simple example might include a

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,279
parenting slack channel where parents

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,440
can share

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,600
experiences issues and resources with

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,760
one another

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,959
another more involved option might be to

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,519
connect parents with

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,880
kids who have uh with kids of similar

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,000
ages who are trying to figure out

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,480
similar things

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,080
so a hot topic right now for us at work

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,959
is looking for shared resources

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,480
on worksheets or home schooling or

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,000
literally anything that keeps our

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,519
children engaged for more than five

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
minutes at a time

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,519
and so setting up these structures

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,600
allows it to be safer space

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,320
for folks to discuss these successes

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,760
issues and challenges

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,320
finally train managers

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,399
so managers will play some of the

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
biggest roles in this pandemic

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,640
at the moment in terms of determining

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,120
whether parents stay or leave

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,279
managers set the tone for boundaries on

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,920
teams for working hours for meeting

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,279
cadence

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,880
and for expectations in general managers

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,120
must be trained on how to be

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,959
accommodating how to have constructive

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,560
and empathetic conversations and how to

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,800
support their employees through this

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,800
time

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,320
third create realistic expectations for

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,959
parents at work

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,240
so if your company operates off of kpis

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,839
or goal setting

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,079
recognize that these goals should be

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,120
different this year

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,800
for parents encourage small goals help

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,040
them determine how much they can

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,000
realistically accomplish and do not

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,160
penalize them

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,360
for being able to accomplish accomplish

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,680
less this year

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,959
or setting more realistic which can be

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,160
viewed as lower

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,079
expectations for work-related goals

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,160
retaining parents in your workforce is

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,040
incredibly beneficial and incredibly

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,959
important

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,880
and if your company doesn't have a good

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,640
answer right now for the question

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,320
how are you supporting employees during

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,600
this pandemic then

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,600
you have some thinking to do

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,959
if you're a manager encourage realistic

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
goal setting

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,680
so again this goes back to supporting

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,240
and retaining your employees long term

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,880
work with them and let them dictate

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,720
what's realistic right now

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,920
so again these solutions are creative

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,160
working options

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,959
support systems and realistic

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,959
expectations

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,920
these items when put into place have

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,160
positive benefits for the entire company

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,680
the open acceptance of diversity and

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
intentional support around the

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,240
uniqueness of a teammate's life

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,160
creates that atmosphere on a team as

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,320
managers and company employees are

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,600
trained to establish and seek out things

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,480
like support systems

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,399
or create realistic expectations anyone

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,360
going through any sort of hardship or

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,240
life adjustment

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,920
feels supported and once you've created

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,600
these systems and benefits

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,200
it's easier to see how similar

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,720
accommodations for others

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,800
enable teens to really thrive

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,760
support systems could help folks from

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,760
burning out

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,440
and normalizing being open about

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,279
struggles and successes

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,800
makes it more likely that somebody who

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,839
is burning out will speak

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,600
up earlier realistic expectations

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,079
encourage teams to craft better

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,839
guidelines around work and promotions

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,519
which often help underrepresented

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,000
minorities succeed

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,200
and creative working options help

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,760
companies attract

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,399
the attract the best talent regardless

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,560
of where they reside

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,880
there are also things that we could and

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,600
should be doing as parents

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,959
first get rid of your parent guilt i

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,440
know it's easier said than done there is

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,600
so much parent guilt right now there's

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,760
so much that we can't do with our kids

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,399
and so much that we have to let drop so

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,480
that we can balance it all

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,079
but that's simply the reality of the

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
situation at the moment

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,360
we need to realize that working and

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
doing things that we

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,240
love is is still important for us and

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,360
for our children to see

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,880
next schedule

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,839
self-care days it took me

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,760
a long time pre-pandemic to do this but

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,120
now with the pandemic a lot of folks

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,279
aren't taking time off

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,040
because you can't really go anywhere but

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,920
taking time off is critical

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,040
i took a week off in june where one day

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,120
my only goal

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,320
was to take my nintendo switch and walk

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,880
into the woods and play

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,079
animal crossing for as many hours as i

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
wished

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,760
my partner and i have been working out

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,720
breaks over the last few months

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,000
just a chance to not be on duty for a

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,560
full 24 hours

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,560
it's important to not put off these days

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,279
and to make sure that you're taking time

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,279
to recharge

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,360
third we can only make this better if

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,519
we're united

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,959
at work we have a parenting channel and

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,880
so many folks have said that the

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,360
existence of that channel and being able

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,760
to share

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,959
ideas stories hacks and struggles with

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,240
one another has been incredibly helpful

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,399
we're also in the process of

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,320
establishing a new parents erg

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,560
or employee resource group so that we

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,199
can come together and focus on what

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,880
parents need

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,560
being able to speak with one another and

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,880
share challenges solutions and

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,399
suggestions is invaluable

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,240
just like having a support group when

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,240
you have a newborn supporting one

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,959
another as parents in tech makes us

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,120
stronger

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,040
and better and gives us a more united

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,760
voice

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,880
next share the mental load

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,360
so i'm going to talk about moms

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,199
specifically um because mothers are dis

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,480
disproportionately affected by the

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,480
weight of mental load

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,160
um although this happens in non-hetero

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,600
partnerships as well

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,040
in 2015 a pew research center study

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,440
surveyed

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,639
1800 parents in households where they

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,279
both work

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,680
they asked who does the work of managing

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,160
your children's schedules and activities

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,639
and who takes care of the kids when

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,639
they're sick

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,000
there have been dozens of articles about

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,639
the amount of mental load among other

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
things

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,160
that primary caregivers are experiencing

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,240
right now

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,560
in addition to this headline another

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,040
article stated that millennial mothers

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,320
are nearly three times more likely than

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,880
millennial fathers

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,040
to report being unable to work due to a

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,600
school or child care closure

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,920
even though in the u.s more than 60

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,079
percent of mothers are now the sole

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,079
or co-breadwinners of their households

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,920
i'll give a pre-covet example let's say

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,160
you have a partner

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,000
and let's say that that partner is great

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,000
which i've actually already found to be

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,440
a pretty big assumption

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,120
let's say that you feel like you've got

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,800
a pretty okay split of work

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,160
you share pickups and drop-offs you

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,759
share who stays home with the kids on

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,759
days off you share cooking cleaning etc

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,360
but what about all the other stuff

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,440
who thinks about what the kids are going

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
to eat for lunch who schedules doctor's

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
appointments

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,079
who knows what day schools is going to

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,680
are going to be closed

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,920
who knows what the next thing the child

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,440
needs developmentally is or sort of what

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,759
what's coming next

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
who buys the birthday presents for the

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,639
birthday parties that are coming up

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,560
who reviews homework plans and packs for

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,040
family trips

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,720
and now think about how many more

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,880
decisions you're making

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,639
or how many more things need to be

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,279
coordinated or thought through in

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,199
advance

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,360
with coronavirus considerations

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,240
if you're already splitting this load i

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
applaud you

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,800
but for many families that isn't the

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,600
case if you're not doing it already

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,440
share this mental load i have a link on

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,320
my website to a worksheet that can be a

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,800
great jump start to this conversation

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,079
one example of a thing that i did was i

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,639
put a checklist on our

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,079
door of who needed what in order to

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,880
leave the house in the morning

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,800
because i realized that i was taking on

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,800
the mental burden of having to make sure

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,560
that everyone was ready in the morning

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,920
even on the days that my husband was

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,320
doing off

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,120
with that list on the door we could both

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,800
make sure

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,040
that everyone had everything that they

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,800
needed without me having to bear that

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,519
burden

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,560
okay so that is disappear parent guilt

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,640
self-care days

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,720
find a community and share the mental

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,360
load

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,760
for your teams remember that just

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,000
existing as a parent on your team

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,160
makes your teams better you are

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,079
organized you need to set boundaries

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,160
you must have some sort of work-life

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,160
balance

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,600
being this role model helps everyone

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,559
even if they don't know that you're role

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,880
modeling it

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,280
so for example last year my team had an

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,679
off-site that i brought my family to

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,919
and in order for me to be available for

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,240
dinner and bedtime each evening

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,080
our day ended at five and we didn't meet

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,880
up for dinner until like 7 or 7

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,919
30. my team brought this up as one of

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,320
the things that they

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,320
loved about our off-site schedule not

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,320
knowing that i had created that break

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,039
because i needed to balance running the

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,679
off-site

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,440
with being present for my family when i

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,240
told them the reason why the break

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,360
existed

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,480
they saw that not only um that not only

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,360
did it benefit me

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,960
and my family but it also benefited them

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,160
by giving them a chance to recharge

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,320
before evening activities

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
finally let's talk about what colleagues

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,520
can do

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,720
colleagues with or without children have

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,120
lots of power

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,559
and ability to be better teammates and

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,120
make companies better for all parents

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,360
first if you don't have children or if a

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,400
majority of your team is childless

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,799
don't make parent stuff weird

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,720
these days i take many meetings with a

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,640
child on my lap

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,240
i often have to pause for a moment to

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,720
answer a question or hear about

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,919
something

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,720
urgent that my child needs to share and

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,320
i am in fact not sorry when i need to

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,480
pause a meeting momentarily

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,000
or hop off a camera for a minute or two

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,000
to start a zoom meeting for a child

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,919
you can also ask parents what they

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,640
prefer you do when a child walks into

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,880
the room

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,880
so i actually dislike it greatly when

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,039
somebody asks if i need to go or if i

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,000
need to attend to my child

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,640
trust me i see them standing next to me

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,919
saying

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,880
mom mom mom mom over

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,400
and over again i am not answering them

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,320
because i do not need to

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,320
and they will probably walk away within

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,240
the next two minutes

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,000
other parents might feel like they can't

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,799
interrupt a meeting in order to respond

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,280
to their child

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,240
so they may prefer that folks ask them

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,480
if they need a pause

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,840
though under no circumstances should you

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,320
say to a parent

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,520
especially a mother it looks like you're

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,520
busy now i'll let you go

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
second be friendly

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,799
so this one's so simple just asking how

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,720
folks are

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,799
right checking in with each other shows

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,480
that you care it shows that parents and

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,400
just all individuals are

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:54,880
appreciated and supported at work

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,880
third make your voice heard

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,080
parents are so tired right now

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,720
they're so so so very tired

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,200
and yet while we're already wearing many

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,360
hats

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,440
and trying to balance multiple full-time

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,360
jobs at once

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,360
we're also trying to hold it together

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,000
and remain emotionally available for our

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,000
children

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,840
and meant to be mentally available for

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
work and colleagues

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,400
and at the same time we're also being

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,960
tasked with identifying exactly what we

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,039
need

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,440
what solutions work for us voicing our

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,520
concerns on teams or with teammates

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,960
when unrealistic expectations are being

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,280
proposed and

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,600
many are fearful that bringing their

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,799
whole self to work right now and voicing

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,720
these concerns

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,120
could put them at risk of losing their

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,120
jobs

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,280
did someone suggest everyone work late

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,600
or schedule a late meeting

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,520
see someone criticizing a parent for

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,320
needing to take time because their child

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,080
is sick

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,480
or they have a child who needs to be

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,440
homeschooled or supervised

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,559
parents feel guilty and parents are

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,080
concerned about

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,280
how long about how long we can continue

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,600
to pull this whole charade off it's

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,720
helpful if others on the team speak up

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,480
as well

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,080
and say something like i know this

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,640
meeting is running over and we want to

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,880
be respectful of those with a hard stop

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,919
or is there any chance we can schedule

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,440
this meeting earlier

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,159
i know it doesn't work for everyone's

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,400
calendar or even

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,280
let's record this so teammates who

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,679
aren't here

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,640
or can't be fully present can catch up

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,960
later

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,480
and a special hack for parents if you're

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,720
catching up later

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,720
watch it on 1.5 or 2 times speed

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:44,559
and finally if someone uses a word or

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,919
concept that you don't know google it

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,159
i like to think that most of us are

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,480
pretty good at googling and we generally

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,559
like

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,760
learning new things um so if you don't

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,640
understand

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,559
child care costs or sleep regressions or

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,520
anything else that a parent on your team

00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,280
mentions

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,400
just google it there are some really

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,679
great resources out there to learn more

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,960
so this final summary is normalize it

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,960
be nice speak up and use google

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,960
while there are specific things that

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,080
colleagues can do to help parents

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,039
these actions benefit everyone and makes

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,559
teams stronger these suggestions really

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,880
boil down to increasing

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,640
empathy curiosity and an interest in

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,360
your colleagues and their lives

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
and a desire to understand one another

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,640
when these

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,679
factors are incorporated into a team's

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,000
dna

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,640
it leads to stronger more effective

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,360
teams that can support and understand

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,360
one another more effectively you might

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,559
speak up about something to support

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,480
parents on your team

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,760
but you're also learning to recognize

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,720
situations where different

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,559
accommodations are helpful

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,159
you're learning how to support teammates

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,080
by asking questions

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,320
and figuring out how to bet how to be a

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,880
better ally on your team

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,559
and teams that are strong in these areas

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,760
help attract and retain

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:09,600
more diverse talent

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,720
some days it all works and some days

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,600
it certainly doesn't some days i can

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,480
give 100

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,600
to both areas and others i feel like i'm

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,600
letting my child

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,679
my children or my job down

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,600
it's important though for all of us as a

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,000
community as developers as

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,679
colleagues as peers and as managers to

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,159
think about this

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,960
don't let us lose a generation of

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,000
talented

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,320
working mothers

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,240
a recent conversation with anna mckenzie

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
one of the co-authors of the parenting

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,440
playbook

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,360
she said that how we work and what work

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,120
looks like is a social construct that

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,279
hasn't changed in years

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,279
and it's true right and the same can be

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,640
said for our schools and how we educate

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,200
our children

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,600
i don't know what the solutions are here

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,600
but there is no box that we can check

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,320
that will accommodate everyone

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,279
there is no guidebook for how companies

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,120
individuals

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:09,840
or peers can best handle this

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,960
we need to throw everything on the floor

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,679
and figure out how to reimagine it

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,120
definitely for now but maybe also for

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,360
forever

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,279
we're getting ready for potential future

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,000
waves of covid19

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,600
and even for schools and daycares that

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,919
are reopening

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,039
parents are just waiting and trying to

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,080
stay prepared

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:36,320
for whatever will come their way next

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,880
and that vigilance is exhausting

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,520
the main question on my mind is which

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,640
will happen

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,440
first will parents break or will we

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,960
or will we be able to find a new way of

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,159
working

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,600
and for parents all i can say from one

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,400
parent to another

00:24:51,600 --> 00:25:01,840
is that you are doing a great job

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,840
thank you

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,240
wow allison thank you so much that was

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,240
incredible i i i you did a great job and

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,840
you are doing a great job that was

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,120
fantastic i think it's so important for

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,080
us to have a little more empathy for

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,919
different perspectives

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,240
when it comes to working in tech and

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,799
working in all other areas

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,320
so let's give you a second to have a

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,200
drink of water have us have a quick

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,200
breath

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,240
um i'm gonna share with you the results

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,120
of today's

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
final developer dilemma do people prefer

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,919
working in an office

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,760
or remotely the results are in

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:44,400
so anyway 85

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:47,600
of you prefer working remotely and 15

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,200
prefer working in an office

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,799
folks feel free to throw in any

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,600
questions you might have for allison

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,600
into the youtube chat in the meantime

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,360
allison thank you once again

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,279
um as a non-parent myself i'm curious

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,880
do you have any further reading or maybe

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,039
a parent driven dev

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,480
podcast episode that you'd recommend for

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,679
me to be able to get started and learn

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,880
more

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:14,799
yeah um oh man to do like a

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,720
super shameless plug here uh the parent

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,559
the parent-driven development podcast is

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,520
if you look at the episode list

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,440
um we just cover a variety of different

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,080
topics on there so it's good to get sort

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,159
of a

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,679
bite-sized sense and dig into anything

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,799
there um

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,360
i think also there are uh if your

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,720
company

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,799
has a parenting channel um i know that a

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,120
number of folks at github

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,799
joined the parenting channel just to get

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,320
a sense even if they're not parents to

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,000
get a sense of like what parents are

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,960
talking about what parents are

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,159
dealing with every day um you know and i

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,520
think the other thing is just

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,760
encouraging

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,200
uh sometimes it's just about encouraging

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,960
parents that you work with

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,120
that you want to know about these things

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,960
and feel comfortable sharing i think

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,320
there are a lot of parents that

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,159
worry about what it means to be a parent

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,799
at work especially a mom

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,640
um right they worry about how that may

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,840
change folks perceptions

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,279
of them um and so just sort of being

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,960
open and saying that you want to hear

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,440
more about that you want to like

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,720
hear what's going on is uh it's a great

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,080
