Description: 
	If you enjoy building projects using TypeScript, you probably wish you could build Ruby projects with a type checker. I've been in that boat! Recently, I stumbled upon Sorbet, a well-maintained type checker for Ruby. In this talk, we'll take a look at how we can use Sorbet. 

Ali Ilman is a software engineer from Malaysia. He works for Suria Labs as a full-stack developer. He writes Ruby and JavaScript and other than these technologies, he's getting his hands dirty with Docker and Kubernetes. He loves TDD and service objects. In his free time, he tends to have his head buried in a book.
