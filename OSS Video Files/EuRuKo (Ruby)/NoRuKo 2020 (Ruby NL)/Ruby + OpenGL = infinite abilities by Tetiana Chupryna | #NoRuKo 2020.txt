	In this talk we’ll explore what can we create using Ruby and OpenGL. We’ll talk about drawing pictures, designing animations and building interfaces. You’ll learn about the basics of OpenGL and eventually, how you can build your own game engine.

Tetiana Chupryna is a Backend Engineer at GitLab where she is working on security analysis. At my spare time, she likes drawing or painting with any materials available.
