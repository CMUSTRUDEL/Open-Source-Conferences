Title: Building Rubyfmt by Penelope Phippen | #NoRuKo 2020

Playlist: #NoRuKo 2020
Description: 
	In this talk I'll discuss Rubyfmt, a work in progress Ruby autoformatter. Why I'm building it, and how it differs from Rubocop, the closest similar tool that you might be familiar with. I'll get deep in to the weeds on some of the technical challenges of building a system like this, and what the overall goals for the project are.

Penelope Phippen makes Rubyfmt, and was previously a lead maintainer of the Rspec testing framework. She's been writing Ruby for just about a decade, and still remembers writing Ruby for 1.8.6.
