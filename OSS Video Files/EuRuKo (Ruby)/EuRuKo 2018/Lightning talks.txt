	00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:53,000
hello everyone welcome back time for the

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,950
lightning talks please take your seat

00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,250
thank you floor thank you

00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:08,380
[Applause]

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:09,510
so we start with fun with or programming

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,670
spreadsheets

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:15,250
yeah I'm not going to be doing that yeah

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:20,500
Mars no Thomas sorry Thomas

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:22,450
so so we have five minutes for each

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,130
stock we have a timer and then we will

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:32,940
be hitting the gun going after the five

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:42,210
minutes and this is mirrored pointer

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:42,210
left hand Mike all right hi I'm Thomas

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,790
you're taking away the precious time I

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,350
think all right so a excuse for the

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,720
strike four but I can ask the sensor my

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,850
advance to search all my slides so

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,650
there's a strike through so the original

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,060
tech was fine with spreadsheets but you

00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,980
know there's no fun with spreadsheets so

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,410
we're talking about programming

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,440
spreadsheets but why spreadsheets you

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,000
know like it's such a boring topic like

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,130
you know we are all programming just too

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,590
and we hope that we are not going to

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,170
have to interact with spreadsheets the

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,210
regular careers that's the that's the

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,620
idea but spreadsheets are basic tool for

00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,660
many professions there are many

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,060
professionals working with spreadsheets

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,680
on daily basis your organization

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,740
probably has one or many poor more

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,380
people they actually you know get things

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,850
done with those spreadsheets possibly

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,190
the critical stuff that you know makes

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,140
you our salaries go through and makes

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,570
the business run and basically most of

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,220
the SAS startups they first need to

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,660
complete of Exel they first need to

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,400
compete with a spreadsheet that's being

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,470
used by the people from a specific

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,450
profession to solve their specific you

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,590
know business problem but yeah we still

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,810
hate spreadsheets right I mean you know

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,640
even if we can I know like program them

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,160
a bit this programming is still kind of

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,000
limited kind of very very convoluted

00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:01,110
very very constrained there's no Ruby

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,010
and there's not much of programming

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,350
craftsmanship that you can show while

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,340
working with spreadsheets but

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,950
spreadsheets are not in decline

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,020
unfortunately you know the demon are for

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,580
30 years and I think they're going to be

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,620
around in a decade

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,300
in the next few decades so I think we

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,440
need to live with them but why should we

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,190
care you know we're not doing

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,160
spreadsheets

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,950
well because probably spreadsheets are

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,420
not boring they could be due to the long

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,340
Sanderson in recent years we can

00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,650
actually make the spreadsheets actually

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,260
kind of fun and kind of doing like way

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,660
more and way more automated way that we

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,490
are used to for example imagine if we

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,110
had a spreadsheet you know where I know

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,450
like some person from our organization

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,600
does something at the spreadsheet could

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,760
talk with an HTTP with an API over HTTP

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,650
grab some JSON and display this data

00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,540
from the suggestion the spreadsheet that

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,860
would be well maybe not pretty cool I

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,440
mean come on it's not cool to just

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,350
consume an API endpoint but still it

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,810
would allow this person to be able to

00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:01,600
automatically get some data from our

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,670
other software that we use or the

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,640
software that we provide maybe and

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,900
ultimately our work we would have a we

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,670
could have a specific you know a

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,830
specific case specific problem solved

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,120
while not having to build a whole

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,250
application right in Christ you write

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,230
the whole front end authentication and

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,170
make the deployment and maintained an

00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:22,120
entire application so what we've we

00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,440
could you know talk to internal API and

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,150
also script the spreadsheets with

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,950
JavaScript I know the JavaScript dirty

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,420
word and I haven't served this out for

00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,130
my slides which I'm really sorry I know

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,050
we're at the Ruby conf last night I

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,610
don't like JavaScript at all

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,140
but still it's our best bet if you want

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,700
if we want to something resembling a

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,910
modern programming language in our

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,350
spreadsheet so let's see if we can do it

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,180
actually we can so this talk is focused

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,160
on Google Spreadsheets but I know that

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,260
in office 365 by Microsoft there's also

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,050
a JavaScript framework that we can use

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,810
for programming and I'm two minutes okay

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,150
until the end that's that's cool I'm

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:59,440
going to basically speaks quicker and

00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,270
quicker as I see the counter timer so we

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,220
can just browse documentation and see

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,630
that we have actually a whole API which

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,920
is even synchronous so it's way better

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,960
than something that we got used to

00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,820
JavaScript in terms of input output that

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,590
can fetch data for external API and you

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,970
have a JSON parser and if we can write a

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,440
function that will just return an array

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,100
of data and put it in our spreadsheet

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,930
and we can write some simple JavaScript

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,330
for example like we can I'd know fetch

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,530
some code for external API yeah it's

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,790
kind of its kind of complicated because

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,199
it actually works you know so there's

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,360
this authorization stuff

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,740
options and then there's messaging this

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,419
data because we need to take the JSON

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,830
and then put it into an array of arrays

00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:38,620
and but if we run it this stuff actually

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,349
does fetch data from the outside

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,879
messages it and it's going to display it

00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:44,469
on spreadsheet so for example our

00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,569
accountant suddenly does not have to

00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:49,270
export the data into CSV copied over and

00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,159
stuff they can just use it to fetch it

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,319
automatically from the from the outside

00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,240
Internet and it works

00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,979
this was an act this is next to working

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,599
code this is of course recorded video

00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:59,919
for the Lightning dr. Sandhu not good

00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:03,310
life live coding

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,830
I'm not crazy enough for this I just

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,270
program spreadsheets and there's a lot

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,710
more we can integrate with Google

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,419
services we can integrate with any kind

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,069
of database that talks over JDBC which

00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,560
means any database really even the ones

00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,360
that you don't want to use and we can

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,860
even send the data away based on what's

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,979
in our spreadsheet what's in our data so

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,659
you know so just go ahead enjoy see if

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,729
in your organization you can help the

00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:26,199
person using spreadsheets to use them

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:28,749
better and not having to find the

00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,879
dedicated software to to stream like the

00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:43,000
work so that's it thank you I'm Tomas

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:45,399
and thank you very much so much so next

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,490
Anna will present another way to stay

00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:55,390
tuned with Ruby right play so Anna good

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,920
luck you have five minutes you can okay

00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,920
hello everyone

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:06,860
[Applause]

00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:09,740
okay today I gonna share my experience

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,410
with dealing with lots of subscriptions

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,890
accounts Twitter accounts medium

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:18,320
subscriptions RSS and so on so everyone

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:28,490
was one so stay tuned and everyone was

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:33,079
valued uninterrupted time okay so when

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:35,839
we are it is not enough to do your daily

00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:38,690
job and that's it everyone was reads a

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:42,230
lot and follows the fresh news that

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:46,190
emerge every time every day and we have

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:51,920
a lot of it takes a lot of effort to

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:55,160
read to read it on daily basis so yeah

00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:01,579
here is some of examples which I am

00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:05,029
subscribed I used used to use IFTTT year

00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:07,100
that put everything to my get pocket

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:10,160
count it was actually it's a good

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,370
application but didn't work for me for

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:18,170
example when I after after it I switched

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:20,810
to Gmail and I use and every every news

00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,959
that I am subscribed to follows to my

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:27,920
gmail account so and it turns out if I

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:31,100
if I was like I was taking out to the

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:35,480
business trip so I fell out of my daily

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:38,959
schedule I didn't have time to read

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,170
enough I didn't have I just forgot that

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,680
I have a lots of new to read so it if it

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:50,240
was one it was like about thirty thirty

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:55,310
notifications today's about 150 and if I

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,170
have an avocation it can be like 60 and

00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,000
some and some more it was really the

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:04,240
motivation to get back to this account

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,160
and to read these all amount of news so

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,130
yeah there was an other problems like

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,529
unused applications which also were a

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:16,000
little bit motivating and these news can

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,770
be can emerge in the different time and

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,040
you starting to read and then you're

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:24,040
realizing like okay I've been really

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,400
need some some time before so it was not

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:32,080
bad and there was another problem which

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:35,110
is unreal II want media noise about some

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,390
topics for me it was Jacob because I

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,990
know about Jacob and I don't want to

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:45,220
read about Jacob every every week like a

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:49,180
new post so I decided to build my boat

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,570
that sends news to me every day in the

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,660
morning and I had an ability to read it

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:59,410
it has some benefits it it provides

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:02,350
unique news it provides quite relevant

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,410
at least for me information and it is

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:08,410
daily so I don't don't get distracted to

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:13,000
it well in case you are using telegram

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:17,950
you can try here is a QR code that you

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,880
can well take a picture and open it so I

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:26,570
hope my boat with my news can help some

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,670
of you to be better developer thank you

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,820
[Applause]

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:34,230
[Music]

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:36,720
thank you very much Anna so on the next

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:53,070
talk miles will be presenting github

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:55,560
automation with CP 8 volt crystal yeah

00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,840
hey lots of people thank you for saying

00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,730
again thanks the organizers a fantastic

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,110
conference go to lots of conferences

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,810
this takes a lot of work to put together

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,220
so yeah thank them later if you see them

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,980
great job so yeah I just want to talk

00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,730
it's on here a little bit about at all

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,530
use in my company cook pad to help

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,610
automate flows and you know everybody

00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,290
we're all working lots of teams

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,650
everybody's making pull requests issues

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,870
and it's just a nightmare so we came up

00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:25,110
with this CP 8 bot that helps us get

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,660
through our daily work initiated by one

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,630
of our engineers yen's who I forgot to

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,810
credit so I should say him

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:35,460
yeah so what can cpa do our first thing

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,230
I think we implemented was to kind of

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,520
just it's quite contentious when

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,200
something's been hanging around in the

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,020
list for weeks and nobody wants to look

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,250
at it for whatever reason and we if I go

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,960
in and close something then you know

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,770
people someone's gonna come back to me

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,510
hey what are you doing

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,880
but if cpa does it it's like oh yeah

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,900
thanks.thanks ep8 it's a whole different

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,870
kind of feeling you know

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,370
beep-boop hi there I'm closing it put a

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,680
heart nobody cares so this is a great

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,340
way of just keeping stale things out of

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,200
your repos we also we have a lot going

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,020
on and we we want to optimize our time

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,370
so we don't want to have other

00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,970
developers reviewing things that aren't

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,630
quite finished

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:16,410
so we tag every pull request with a WIP

00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:19,830
at the front there which means WIP

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,090
working progress that's it and what cp8

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,640
does it doesn't sound like much and it

00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,320
will just automatically tag that pull

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,610
request but then you set your filter and

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,100
github and then you just never see this

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:32,640
stuff that isn't ready to be reviewed

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,140
and also if you remove the the WIP from

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:39,870
the header cp8 will go in and remove

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:41,700
that tag for you one of the one of the

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,710
really cool things also is this tiny in

00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,130
this review loop there's so much going

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,170
on

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,910
nobody nobody knows what's going on

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,710
let's throw more stuff in slack that

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,130
will fix it so we have something here

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:55,920
that when our new pull request is made

00:14:52,130 --> 00:15:00,630
cp8 will post into a review channel in

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,030
slack and I think if it's less than 50

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,560
lines or 100 line pull requests 100

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,630
changes we try and you know optimize for

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,420
small changes it'll start pinging people

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,400
directly otherwise it's a bit random if

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,750
you use a recycle sign it will ping you

00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,110
again that something's ready to review

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,480
and also will post in that channel when

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,460
something's been approved this one I

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,290
guess was Carl so it's a car so he knows

00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,620
his pull request is done just saves a

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,810
bit of time and we like this this is

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,790
something actually I implemented

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,670
recently so I do actually do something

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,170
in the company believe it or not but

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,030
yeah so we we want to have this kind of

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,720
issue where everyone in the company can

00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:41,280
add issues and ideas and projects to

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,960
that they want to get down and bugs into

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,270
a global inbox seem like a you know

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,650
great idea then we'll triage them it's

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,000
gonna be cool we're prioritize then

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,760
we'll move them to our squad repos

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,530
everything's gonna be cool oh no you

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:58,530
can't move things between repos we found

00:15:52,530 --> 00:16:00,030
in github but hey cp82 the rescue this

00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,350
is a bit complicated but basically just

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:05,520
by using labels you can specify

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,710
different repos that you want to move an

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,630
issue or a PR to and just label it and

00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,210
cpa will go and copy the original move

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,920
it to the new repo close the old one and

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,290
put a tag to it so that way we can still

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,020
maintain a master list of our just have

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:22,380
one central inbox but then you know move

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,430
things around to the right squads oh and

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,030
also it has a command-line interface

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,140
which is this was actually the original

00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,270
yeah original thing we did with this

00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,770
tool but you can do you know you can

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,230
start a pull request actually by doing

00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,660
CP 8 starts and a title like fix the

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,430
website or something and it won't open

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,710
create a branch and get you working and

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,000
then CPS cp8 submit will then create a

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,760
pull request and github and opened

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,130
github and yeah and then it can do

00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,170
whatever you want so it's open source

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,180
tons of open source on github comm slash

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:54,640
cook pad but CPA it's pretty fun to work

00:16:51,180 --> 00:17:01,060
with quite easy and setups easy

00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:05,350
yeah that's it thank you thank you very

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:07,540
much miles so for the next talk must

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:09,160
many of you probably have used already

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,200
microservice and maybe you do them

00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,579
really well but now we learn how to do

00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,490
micro-services badly

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:21,060
so welcome oz that's the title of the

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:21,060
talk by the way right it's all right

00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,150
thank you

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:35,530
I really regret having signed up for

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:38,230
this by the way okay how did you

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,760
micro-services badly my name is Maz I am

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,950
currently tech lead at not on the high

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,640
street comm which is a an e-commerce

00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:47,170
company in London we have just a bit of

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,100
background on us we have 3.5 million

00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:53,980
active users 150 million yearly sales

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,970
200 staff 40 tech team and the reason

00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,150
I'm saying this is because it's

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:00,310
important to know that you can have code

00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:10,330
of questionable quality in production

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:12,580
and still be making good money okay so

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,060
this this is what the rails app looked

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,610
like today three years ago important to

00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,470
note is that we had something like 240

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:24,040
thousand lines of code at that point in

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:27,610
time I mean it's really like 65,000

00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,620
application code so we're looking at the

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,720
situation we're like how do we add new

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,010
features how do we scale how do we move

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,990
quicker you know these are all things

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,220
that we're like this is getting really

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:40,090
hard

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:43,170
let's do micro services hooray yeah

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,280
trust me I'm a developer so we we have a

00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,600
clutter nice culture actually where we

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,070
kind of trust although we have several

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,670
development teams we trust them all to

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,430
condon we sorry sorry can you guys still

00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,860
hear me okay

00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,970
we we trust them all too we trust our

00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,230
development teams to kind of go off and

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,290
do everything and that's worked really

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,520
well for us so far but with micro

00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,220
services that proved to be a little bit

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,390
more complicated so just to give you an

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,830
illustration of what I mean if you

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,480
imagine that we have four or five

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:14,230
technical teams all working on this

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,550
monolith and then we say okay go off and

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,470
build some micro services and do it

00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,260
whichever way you want to do it so we

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,580
have one team that comes in and goes

00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,230
okay well I have a background in Java

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,990
and I really want to pay this built this

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,090
payment service in Java so I'm gonna go

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,940
and do that and then the Ruby people are

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,320
like well I don't like Java so I'm gonna

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,360
build another rails micro service

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,860
actually and then there's another Ruby

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,040
developer who's like I don't like Rails

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,420
so I'm gonna build it in just plain Ruby

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,560
and then we have a few other developers

00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,500
who are like well the model

00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,720
fine but let's just like put a few more

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,680
instances of it into production that

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:55,390
start the app in a different way because

00:19:50,680 --> 00:20:00,510
that's quite nice actually each one of

00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:03,190
those takes like 8 gigabytes of RAM yeah

00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,840
and then in the meantime the Java teams

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,650
you know happily building more things

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,690
and and then somebody else comes in and

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:15,330
goes go is a really cool language we

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:15,330
should use that that was me

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,180
so it looks like that now and then we're

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,750
like well how do all these services

00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:27,400
communicate let's build an event bus

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,580
that was us - yeah that was me that was

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,170
my team and then it's like well this is

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,780
really hard to work with let's just do

00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:39,850
serverless and screw everything and

00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:41,170
that's also my current team yeah so it

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:47,670
kind of got to a point where it coming

00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:52,330
to work felt like this that's me yeah

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:54,250
this is kind of tricky now so we're like

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:58,150
ok which maybe we shouldn't have trusted

00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:01,420
the developers this much but actually

00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:03,070
it's we realized that we put all our

00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,350
focus on solving the technical problems

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,940
right and we didn't put any focus into

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,830
actually getting the team together

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,780
getting working together and having the

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,780
same kind of tools and same kind of

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:18,990
approach and we basically didn't have a

00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:22,420
strategy to do this correctly so it's ok

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:24,100
we're fixing it we're working on it I

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,290
actually love my job

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,790
and yeah I it's actually a really cool

00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:31,800
place to work and if you want to work in

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,800

presentation by the way we are

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,980
exercising the gong it's just that I

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,510
think everyone is so scared of it that

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,090
they've all finished like with a minute

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,750
of advance but yeah here we go with Gabi

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,750
thank you

00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:22,000
[Applause]

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,210
hello everyone as you may already know I

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,280
am Gabriella and I come from Bulgaria

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,410
I've been working with Ruby for the past

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,660
three years and I want to dedicate this

00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:34,390
lightning talk to all of the Ruby's out

00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,630
there it's my first year at the

00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:39,490
University I started studying C++

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,640
unfortunately the teachers weren't

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:45,310
really interested in teaching and I was

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,110
totally disappointed and discouraged at

00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:49,570
the end of it year I was blaming

00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:52,120
everything on the language as it was too

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:55,420
complex and told me as I was not good

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:58,390
enough to grasp it so next year I took

00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:00,820
to Ruby courses which is by far one of

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,650
the best decisions in my life I came

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:07,030
across people who were so passionate

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:10,270
about teaching encouraging beginners and

00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:12,540
you know explaining concepts that I

00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:16,920
started believing in my own capabilities

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:19,930
so this was the moment I realized that I

00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:23,950
shouldn't be blaming C++ or me for my

00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:26,410
first fear first year failure and I it

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:31,300
occurred to me that with the right help

00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:34,030
and guidance I can do better so half a

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:37,060
year later I started my internship with

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:39,880
Ruby and another six months later I

00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:44,470
started volunteering at the Oscars event

00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:48,160
in Bulgaria as I felt inspired you know

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:52,270
to pay my knowledge experience forward

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:55,000
since 2015 real girls keeps being one of

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:58,210
the most rewarding and satisfying

00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,790
experience in my life so what I'm trying

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,950
to say here is that the Ruby community

00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:05,410
played a really important role in my

00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,370
shaping as a developer Ruby made me with

00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,620
wonderful people

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,780
it taught me it is okay to ask it is

00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,760
okay to be a beginner and not know

00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,520
everything because there is always

00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:18,600
someone out there who is willing to help

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,910
or at least give advice you know and

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,550
three years after my first Ruby code I

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,900
gave my first talk at the bakken Ruby

00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:31,120
conference in Sofia it gathered around

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:34,059
150 people and I was so nervous

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,820
scared because not because this was my

00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:38,620
first talk big talk but because I was

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,240
supposed to talk in front of people with

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,790
far more experience and knowledge

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,250
compared to mine long story short the

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:48,460
talk went good far better than I was

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:52,030
expecting actually and the positive

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:54,490
feedback I received there is the reason

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:58,180
why I am here giving a lightning talk in

00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:00,400
front of like 600 people you know so I

00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,140
just really wanted to say thank you guys

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,720
thank you for being such a good

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,550
community supporting beginners this

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,710
year's diversity tickets are just

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:11,890
another example that the Ruby community

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:15,700
really cares about its feature future

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:18,610
excuse me and and I believe that kind

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,230
words an appreciation matter so I just

00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,090
wanted to remind you how wonderful you

00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:25,300
are and to be sure to keep up with the

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:27,550
good work and to beginners really don't

00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,130
hesitate to ask questions to search for

00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:32,590
help to search for a mentor workshop or

00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:35,770
organization because people are really

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:38,830
kind and as much pointed out yesterday
