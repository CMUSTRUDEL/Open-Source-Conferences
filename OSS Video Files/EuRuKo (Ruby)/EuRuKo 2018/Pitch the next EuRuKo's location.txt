00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,969
little bit about Bristol which is my

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:04,199
town now what works so yeah why Bristol

00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:15,990
I want to try and play a video I don't

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:17,610
know how that's going to work but this

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,939

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,939
like that

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:39,560
this is all part of the full part of the

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:56,000
show don't worry this worked in in the

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:57,910

yeah with we're not at that stage yet

00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,660
but I'll get back to you so yeah this is

00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,740
this is my town Bristol and many people

00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,900
don't know this and actually a quick

00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,000
story I'd actually never been to Bristol

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,510
I'm from England originally but I've

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,980
been away for 20 years and I had the

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,330
kind of very fortunate position I've

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,190
been working in Japan for seven years

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,100
and my company said we want to open

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,780
office in the UK go choose somewhere so

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,150
I traveled around the UK went to many

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,430
places don't want to bad-mouth anyone

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,170
but Bristol kind of popped up on my

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,489
radar so let me let me try this place

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:39,170
blew me away instantly so let's see I

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,860
don't go back to the slides

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,590
I think covering a time so you're really

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,709
really blew me away about the people the

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:52,520
kind of the culture the diversity here

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:55,790

a really amazing food and I having lived

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,510

I must say that women are a large part

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:48,060
of our communities females get always a

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,310
major role in bulgarian society since

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,550
ancient times women fought even

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,800
alongside with men Bulgarian women have

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,399
always been a central part of the work

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,430
force

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,160
and you know Bulgaria is the European

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,949
nation that holds the highest share of

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,610
women involved in tech the company I

00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:11,430
