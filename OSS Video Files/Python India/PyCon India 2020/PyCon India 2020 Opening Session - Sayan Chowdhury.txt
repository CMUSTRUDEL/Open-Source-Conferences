          that                                has been uh going on for                                             and i would really                                uh give a huge shout out to all the

          so today as you know is the conference                                day um                                so october                                                             our conference day                                it would be followed by the uh workshop                                day which is                                october                                                                 and then we all are also having a                                developer sprint or                                as you call it death prince on october                                                                                   so um i hope you all have a very good                                time in the next four days                                and you get to learn a lot you get to                                interact a lot and you get to                                meet a lot new people we                                saw expected registrations around                                     plus people                                so it's good to know that                                we are having a huge crowd coming down                                to pike on india                                and being part of the community                                so now going forward i would like to                                introduce on                                how the setup is because sadly this year                                we                                the idea was to go uh we would be having                                a huge                                offline conference but then uh due to                                the unprecedented times we are                                we had to change our whole uh plan to an                                online conference                                so uh with this new setup every uh for                                everyone it is a new thing                                uh being the whole virtual conference                                the whole concept of virtual conference                                is pretty new                                so uh one thing i would like to tell is                                uh i would like to guide you through all                                the                                 platforms that we are using through this                                 event so the first thing we have hop in                                 uh                                 where you are probably seeing me live                                 doing this talk                                 and uh you will be seeing all the                                 keynote stocks and probably it's the                                 basically the                                 attendee platform that we have where all                                 the interaction would happen                                 we have the communication platform which                                 is zoolip uh zulip is a                                 platform where uh it's primarily                                 text-based there's no                                 audio video it's primarily text-based so                                 anything that you want to                                 do uh in terms of text so you can                                 hop over on zulip uh lastly we have uh                                 streamyard                                 so streamyard is our broadcast studio so                                 all the speakers                                 keynotes uh anyone giving a talk would                                 be joining a stream yard they probably                                 would have                                 received the guidelines that they will                                 be uh following through                                 and uh yeah so they would be primarily                                 following                                 the streamia guidelines and it would be                                 broadcasted                                 over to happen uh                                 now i'll try to take you through each of                                 the hopping stages because i                                 would love like or to speak like                                 it would be a great thing that you get                                 make the most out of the conference                                 so i'll take you through all the st uh                                 hop in                                 um kind of a demo so                                 first on the list is the stages which is                                 the most important part i would say                                 so we have a four stage five stages                                 which is                                 bengaluru chennai hyderabad delhi and                                 pune this is                                 uh why did we come up with the city                                 names so this has nothing to do with the                                 place you're living it's it's more on                                 i would say the hosting pike on india                                 uh city so we have had uh pycon india                                 hosted on this city so we thought that                                 it would be a good idea to                                 acknowledge just to add a tiny bit of                                 um that feeling of uh offline                                 conferences                                 so as the bangalore team was the one who                                 was                                 uh trying to uh do the groundwork so                                 bengaluru stage would be the primary                                 stage                                 where all the keynotes all uh would                                 happen                                 uh then we would have the chennai stage                                 which was                                             team we had the hyderabad which did the                                 pike on india for on                                      and they then we have uh delhi which did                                 in                                 uh                                                                      i recall currently it was in                                       so uh if you have any questions uh i                                 have                                 few guidelines on how to you can ask for                                 help                                 but i'll try to move forward now so uh                                 if you see                                 like this is probably this is the hop                                 into platform so we have the stages                                 and when you click on stages it is on                                 the left navbar                                 when you click on stages you will see uh                                 all the stage listed in there                                 uh so you have the bengaluru chennai so                                 whichever talk is happening                                 check the schedule and you can join that                                 particular                                 stage next one                                 important thing is on the top navbar you                                 will see a small                                 time left and a calendar so calendar                                 ideally tells you which talk is                                 happening or which talk is going to                                 happen                                 so this gives you a clear idea uh on                                 which talks you would like to attend so                                 uh                                 do check the schedule on which stage it                                 is happening and                                 feel free
