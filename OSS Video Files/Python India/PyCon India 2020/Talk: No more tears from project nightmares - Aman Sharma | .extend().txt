                 how you can be consistent across all                                these points                                how you can be efficiently carrying out                                all these tasks and                                obviously how your all team is expected                                to deliver everything at                                         so this is a small talk agenda let's                                quickly go through it                                we'll be covering about what are the                                things that are conveniently going wrong                                with normal and amateur                                project practices also what should be                                done in order to                                plan a project in a very efficient and                                smooth manner so that all these above                                problems doesn't occur                                and how you can set up a best                                environment so that                                you have a productive workspace your                                team is productive and working                                efficiently all the time                                and how you can optimize your project to                                make it survive through all the future                                jobs and turf sprints and whatever                                is coming along the final delivery day                                how you should plan                                to actually execute the final delivery                                of the product and for                                finally a quickly recap into everything                                that we covered in the today's talk                                but i want to clarify this thing i'm not                                a mba student or i haven't done any                                project management and this talk is not                                about project management                                this talk is about you delivering the                                best way                                a project should be done so                                if you find these helpful feel free to                                add more suggestions or any opinions                                so let's start the first point is what's                                going wrong                                you see that there is a usual project                                story chart that i have created over                                here on the y                                axis you can see it is a relation                                between anxiety shame and fear                                and on x-axis you have time which is                                first of all unproductive and finally at                                the end of the time it becomes more                                productive                                so usually this is the line that is the                                ideal line of a burn down rate                                and your anxiety shame and fear should                                get decreased by the                                time you are ending the project but it                                doesn't occur all the time                                at the starting point you nee knew                                everything that you need to do                                you assume that you knew what what you                                need to do but                                as soon as you start working as a time                                 increases the anxiety shame and fear of                                 completing the project                                 increases a lot and then finally this is                                 the point where you actually start                                 working which is a huge gap between the                                 time you're new and then the time you                                 start and that is where                                 everything goes into crisis then                                 everything                                 is a nightmare journey through all this                                 hell of this time in which anxiety and                                 shame and fear is decreasing and                                 increasing over the time                                 and this is what we'll categorize at                                 health                                 and this is the time where i'm trying to                                 make things easier for you                                 through this talk and after that                                 everything is fine                                 back into your productive space but you                                 have already wasted a lot of time wasted                                 a lot of energy and your team might not                                 like it so let's make sure that this                                 doesn't happens in your next print or                                 next project                                 and that's what this talk will help you                                 through one important thing that i have                                 found                                 during my career journey is to create                                 half products that's totally fine but                                 not create half as product and there is                                 a very good differentiating line between                                 these                                 two always shift the things that you are                                 fully confident with don't shift things                                 that okay                                 so one of the main reason why things                                 fail is because of poor planning                                 you see poor planning is like creating a                                 rail track                                 while the train is running or like                                 fixing things as they occur                                 so you are not actually developing                                 something you are just doing crisis                                 management                                 and it's you are not the only one most                                 of the problems occur                                 uh in in crisis management only and                                 that's because                                 mainly due to poor planning also another                                 problem that people usually face is                                 thought clarity every people                                 every person in the team has a different                                 perception about what the project needs                                 to be delivered                                 and some people like just not understand                                 what the thing that they are trying to                                 build                                 is mainly because everybody has a                                 different opinion different level of                                 thinking so they assume things                                 differently                                 how we can fix these things is also                                 covered during this talk                                 also many people are not using the tools                                 optimized my friends                                 professionals who have a quite good                                 experience will respect this opinion                                 that's                                 two tools should be very well used but                                 most of the people like this poor fellow                                 guy don't know what these tools are                                 or this guy who thinks that it's really                                 overwhelming to use the tools so just                                 get through this and                                 which actually wastes a lot of time of                                 your team everybody is not using the                                 accurate tool that they should be using                                 one important problem is also premature                                 optimization which is classified into                                 three ways                                 thinking too far you are thinking a lot                                 ahead story you are thinking of making a                                 product as comparison to facebook or                                 google                                 which is not possible at current time                                 also most of the people are thinking of                                 scalability they are thinking of making                                 the application run for millions of                                 people's                                 which is totally not true the                                 application that has been designed for a                                 thousand people might not run for the                                 next ten thousand so always just take                                 care of the current uh                                 load size that your application is going                                 to handle don't think of lot of                                 scalability that is going to come in the                                 future                                 also sometimes the scope of the whole                                 project is so much overwhelmed that                                 just starting and finishing it is not                                 making any sense                                 also another problem is if you don't                                 optimize your project at all like                                 premature optimization is wrong but not                                 optimization at all is also wrong                                 people think that if things are working                                 in the project then you should not touch                                 it                                 and things don't run constantly it                                 sometimes they run on some                                 piece of input and some other piece of                                 input it won't work                                 then people don't rigorously test things                                 they leave it to the users if there are                                 testing                                 happening it should be by the user's                                 complaint which is really wrong way to                                 do things                                 and of course unfavored production it's                                 not important that your machine or the                                 development environment that you might                                 be using                                 is exactly the same as the server or the                                 production environment                                 that will be over there so all these                                 problems leads no optimization at all                                 and creating a lot of chaos                                 let's come to the final solution then                                 how you should actually plan the project                                 so you see there are different                                 definitions of what people think about                                 you know project from moms to dads                                 to what clients think the project                                 manager actually does what you think                                 what project management                                 is and this actually is what you are                                 doing is like micromanaging everything                                 like                                 kittens playing on the road so one                                 important thing that i found very                                 important                                 is talking in terms of diagram if you                                 practice this thing in every project                                 trust me there won't be any thought                                 player any problem                                 or problem in delays talking in diagram                                 means that you create                                 a diagram of the fully functional thing                                 that you are trying to build                                 the benefits of this process are it                                 brings a lot of clarity in the whole                                 project                                 it confirms that everybody is in the                                 same page everybody knows what they are                                 trying to build and they are not missing                                 in the point                                 also it also avoids any possible                                 rundowns because all these modules are                                 labeled very well on the diagram and you                                 don't have any surprise modules or                                 surprise function or surprise                                 infrastructure that you have to add                                 in the middle of the project also it                                 helps you plan properly what resources                                 you will need                                 what kind of skill set you will need and                                 they don't create a                                 mid mid project crisis or anything like                                 that                                 but another question that arises is how                                 much planning or how much diagrams that                                 you should actually make                                 it should be just enough to get everyone                                 around you're not trying to plan                                 a whole indian project or something                                 you're just trying to get all these five                                 people's know about what projects you're                                 working on                                 it should be made with collaboration if                                 you are the project manager or the lead                                 of the project                                 it's not not just the responsibility of                                 the project manager but                                 the whole team if everybody discussed                                 comes on the same table and discusses                                 what and how the project should be made                                 trust me there won't be any problem                                 occurring in the future                                 also it should be regularly talk if you                                 have a practice common practice of                                 holding regular meetings                                 then try to get through this project                                 plan that you have just created in every                                 meeting                                 details are not necessarily it's not                                 important to nail down every detail                                 every touch point every single seconds                                 but just a simple overview that what                                 people                                 actually should know about the project                                 and finally                                 try to run through all these uh steps                                 that you have written down in the                                 flowchart like a stimulation what will                                 happen if this is coming what will                                 happen in this we're coming                                                                                                          these issues that might occur in the                                 production                                 solved in the diagram phase only and if                                 you are a team of highly skilled marine                                 you don't need to you are already expert                                 but most of us are not so let's try to                                 follow these steps                                 and how you should actually do that                                 first thing that i have always found                                 helpful is explore by a sample project                                 we are not expert in building everything                                 from scratch so it always helps in                                 trying to find an example project that                                 is very very close                                 to what we are trying to build it helps                                 you understand what kind of problem they                                 might have faced what kind of teams they                                 might have used how much time                                 it took them and there are they write                                 mostly blogs and                                 different foss software even have their                                 open source code                                 the diagrams that it the code is using                                 so it's very helpful to go through these                                 projects                                 always start by adding main elements of                                 the project first and then go through                                 the details                                 you should carry on like basic                                 structures like what databases you might                                 be using                                 where are the api interactions going to                                 happen where is the security                                 infrastructure that you are going to                                 put in place where is the identity                                 management like the basic stuff that the                                 important elements that your project is                                 trying to cover                                 this is the first thing that you should                                 put on the project then start with                                 specifying input and outputs try to                                 connect them with arrows like what is                                 going out and what is going                                 into different modules this helps you                                 plan if you are trying to create a                                 loosely coupled or micro service based                                 application it helps                                 kind of reduce any possible deadlocks or                                 any situation that is going to happen in                                 the future                                 lay down all the tools that you might be                                 using for the whole project                                 this helps the team learn in advance                                 what are the skills that they need to                                 have                                 in order to work on that project so that                                 in order to work on the project people                                 are not learning the skills going                                 through a lot of documentation                                 in middle of the project they are going                                 to do it just before starting up the                                 project                                 and also add any connections if your                                 application might be using any third                                 party api go through the documentation                                 very                                 very well and add these connections into                                 the diagram okay                                 next of course if you are working in a                                 team which is the most uh                                 cases if you are not a lone ranger so                                 this is some do's and don'ts that you                                 should follow first of all                                 tech talk regularly don't create uh                                 information or communication silos                                 between people                                 you should talk clearly all these points                                 that you are trying to discuss should be                                 discussed                                 very clearly and there is no stupidness                                 or shame that a person should feel                                 in order to ask any questions if you are                                 the leader                                 of the team you should lead by example                                 and you should be the first one who                                 should start asking stupid questions                                 and then the team will follow you                                 also connect efficiently it's not                                 important to                                 connect just for a chit chat your agenda                                 and everything should be laid down in                                 the                                 beginning of any meeting and that how it                                 should be                                 it should be carried out then every                                 responsibility that has been planned                                 during the project and that's                                 in the diagram should be shared                                 responsibly so that                                 everybody is assigned with a key thing                                 and whenever something goes wrong there                                 is an answerable person it's not                                 important that it matches his skills                                     but if there is a manager for a small                                 thing it really eases up the process and                                 doesn't delays the project a lot                                 also there are some don'ts that you                                 should follow while teaming up                                 you should not hold long meetings long                                 meetings create a lot of chaos                                 create light a lot of tiredness and                                 people will stop attending your meetings                                 in the future                                 don't add unnecessary people into the                                 team just because it's they are around                                 it's not important to add them into the                                 meeting as elon musk says if you are not                                 participating in a meeting you should                                 just leave it and it's no problem in                                 doing that                                 also you should not duplicate roles one                                 person should be assigned for one                                 particular thing                                 and that's it and try to                                 keep a regular energy and complete                                 consistent energy throughout the project                                 it's usually the case that people are                                 very excited in the starting of the                                 project and then after                                 an hour they are just okay so try to                                 keep                                 up the energy pace constant throughout                                 the whole project                                 next important thing that you might be                                 wondering is how you can predict the                                 resources resources                                 in prediction is very important in order                                 to avoid                                 any possible delays that might occur in                                 the future                                 what things you should keep in mind is                                 basically the time                                 now the time shouldn't be exactly                                 calculated                                 but it should be roughly estimated that                                 by when you are expected to deliver this                                 project                                 and by the time you start working on the                                 project and your anxiety level goes down                                 you will be more sure about when the                                 project is going to get finished off                                 also calculate the effort the difference                                 between time and effort is effort is the                                 output of the time it will take each                                 individual developer to complete a                                 single module                                 and the time divided by effort is the                                 actual resource of the amount of                                 developer time you                                 need also try to create a rough                                 estimation of what servers machine or                                 hardware you might be using                                 and they should be already kind of set                                 up before even the deploy                                 so that there can be uh possible                                 rundowns during the server failure and                                 any configuration failure can be avoided                                 on the final day                                 also calculate and try to keep all these                                 skills that the team needs on hand                                 before starting the project so that they                                 can start learning on things without any                                 problem in the future                                 another thing that you might be thinking                                 is setting up sprint uh                                 deliverable and milestone so for those                                 of you who haven't known the concept of                                 sprint sprint is nothing but                                 a regular consistent work uh                                 kind of schedule in which you try to                                 complete a particular task                                 and you can use tools such as github                                 issues to complete particular                                 uh issues and then assigned to it to a                                 label and then                                 completing these labels by one go and                                 then you can use karna burn tools like                                 trello which has been very helpful all                                 these tools are free and get crack and                                 timelines to measure the milestone that                                 your whole project will be delivering                                 these tools                                 are the things that you can use but what                                 not to do while setting up the milestone                                 is the important factor over here                                 don't add too much details to the sprint                                 sort and too much kind of                                 uh individual details like how this                                 thing should be made should be left to                                 the users how they feel comfortable                                 on how to create these things also don't                                 create a long sprints                                 long sprints causes a huge chance of the                                 project getting delayed                                 don't add large number of deliverables                                 to the project if there are large number                                 of deliverables try to split them into                                 the previous                                 print or the next print also don't                                 create half features half features are                                 not                                 good for any of the sprint even the                                 previous print or the next print so                                 either add completely in the previous                                 one or add add completely to the next                                 one                                 and don't add on the fly changes because                                 they are the major reason which are                                 trying to bring                                 and to the project that you are trying                                 to make people are not happy with it                                 your developers don't understand them                                 quickly and they won't be tested                                 also don't try to be the uncle sam who                                 promises false deliverable time and then                                 you can't actually deliver so be                                 reasonable with the times and project                                 timelines that you will be creating                                 now you have set up your time you have                                 set up the every plan that you have to                                 create now you are actually getting to                                 start the work and this is the time                                 where you should take care of the                                 environment that your team is going to                                 work in                                 the first thing that is very important                                 is the team communication you should                                 have a definitive meeting calendar                                 and you should plan it ahead all the                                 month calendar whenever you are going to                                 meet and talk about certain modules                                 it should be pre-assigned so that there                                 are no surprise meetings coming in along                                 and nobody can make an excuse about that                                 also after end of every meeting try to                                 keep notes what have been                                 talked about what have been assigned to                                 someone so that they can come back and                                 they can discuss the previous notes                                 first before going into the next one                                 also create a definite communication                                 channel that holds all the historical                                 data all the historical instructions                                 that you have                                 so that if somebody was not totally                                 attentive you can go back and easily go                                 through these points                                 it's not important to only use slack you                                 can use any communication tool                                 but it's very important to keep a                                 transparency and everybody uses the                                 shared channel of communication                                 and if you don't then you will be missed                                 like mr kim who orders something else                                 and                                 it causes a world crisis uh just because                                 of misunderstanding of the communication                                 now uh amateurs won't will have the                                 problem in this thing and professionals                                 won't                                 so just for the neutrality of the whole                                 talk we are going to talk about the git                                 ritual that i have made myself                                 so before starting any code like                                 whenever you start your machine and                                 start coding for the workday first of                                 all you should do a git pull                                 definitely so that you know what other                                 have worked on before you are not                                 working on that and also after you do a                                 significant change let it be a new file                                 edition new module edition try to commit                                 it with a well leveled commit                                 and also after every time you exit for                                 the day or for an hour for the lunch                                 try to push it to the kid trust me if                                 you follow this ritual this will                                 help you avoid this possible mis                                 price crisis which uses uh good push                                 force for everything and that causes a                                 lot of cures in the whole project                                 so this is the git ritual that you can                                 use and also                                 as uh the environment that we are                                 talking about the actual environment in                                 which you are going to work on                                 is as important as the as all these                                 points that we discussed                                 so this is a photo of my workspace that                                 i use you don't need to spend a lot of                                 money on doing that just                                 take care of basics like having a nice                                 ambient place to work                                 with a good lighting condition good air                                 coming in not a lot of noises not a lot                                 of kids or dogs playing around                                 just a nice place so that you are                                 focused on your work                                 dual display is a very good way to get                                 productivity out of your setup                                 it helps you debug things and code                                 things at different screens which is                                 very helpful instead of switching tabs                                 also take care about the ergonomics that                                 you have been sitting on it's not                                 important to spend a lot of money on                                 just a gaming chair but a good one that                                 has a good lumbar support                                 and you have a good posture going on so                                 that you don't get stressed if you are                                 not if you are stressed                                 then you won't be able to work good and                                 also                                 uh if you have mess around that would                                 lead to mess in your code also                                 so just try to keep everything clean and                                 light in your workspace and it will help                                 you in getting through the sprint on the                                 time                                 so here are some apps you might already                                 know about some of these apps which                                 i have discussed in the previous one                                 this is a quick recap of all the apps                                 and tools that you can use                                 which include trello for project                                 planning slack for communication                                 diagrams.net for creating diagrams                                 all these are free tools then you can                                 use other tools uh                                 ubuntu is a is mostly used for python                                 project just because of the                                 compatibility that python has with                                 ubuntu if you are a windows machine                                 users                                 your you have something called as linux                                 subsystems that you can install on a                                 machine and run                                 ubuntu inside windows without the                                 virtual environment                                 directly like a cli command and then                                 flask for the apis most of these things                                 you will already know                                 i use termix for cli client which has                                 been very good but you can use                                 any cli or ssh client but you should                                 have one so that you can easily connect                                 with the server                                 and then jupyter notebooks to test out                                 the code and github actions for ci cd                                 and then a perfect ide either pycharm or                                 vgs                                                           personally i use python because it is a                                 bundle of lot of tools that you have                                 seen                                 inside one and their community edition                                 is also very good                                 now you have created your project and                                 now you are trying to come to the point                                 where you are trying to optimize the                                 project                                 so this is where you should start                                 planning the project from the day one                                 your project organization should be in a                                 colder manner what form                                 sorry to interrupt just time check we                                 just have another five minutes                                 okay so the folder manner is a way that                                 everything that you are trying to create                                 a new module                                 is inside different mod folders you                                 should not add a lot of script into your                                 main                                 script if your main script is loaded                                 with a lot of things then this will                                 leave the same example with the other                                 project modules that you are having                                 everything should be enclosed within a                                 function and main should not be bloated                                 up with all the functionalities                                 all files and functions should be named                                 properly depending upon the aspect                                 of uh things that you are working on                                 instead of just the                                 puppy names that you thought were funny                                 to name but actually the                                 workable things that you can name them                                 and finally the comments formats logs                                 everything should be properly documented                                 if everything happens fine then the                                 python won't bite you                                 and there won't be any these kinds of                                 hurting things occurring in your way                                 this is a small note that people don't                                 usually follow usually in python people                                 install dependencies on the fly                                 and pip freeze is not a good way to use                                 uh twins                                 like create the dependency which i have                                 found uh not not that good so paper x is                                 a good                                 uh requirements management dependency                                 management tool that you can use in                                 order to create some well documented                                 recommend                                 requirement.txt based on the modules                                 that your current project is using                                 and also try to always work in a virtual                                 environment so that if everything goes                                 south you are not able to understand                                 environment you can just detach and                                 create a new virtual environment                                 from scratch so that it doesn't has any                                 impact on the production                                 and modern problems require modern                                 solutions so always try to find new ways                                 to                                 uh you know kind of get around with the                                 requirements and production things                                 we have covered most of the things and                                 your project is working fine and                                 everything                                 hope so everything worked fine you are                                 now on the final delivery date                                 and this is the time where you will be                                 thinking about how you should deliver                                 the project so there are three ways to                                 do that the easiest one is ftp                                 file transmission protocol or ssh which                                 is the easiest way to get connected with                                 the server                                 but it's a lot manual and you have to                                 change everything manually but if your                                 project is just in the starting stage                                 this is the best one to go because this                                 has the least number of complications                                 if your project involves a lot of                                 releases a lot of people are working on                                 the project                                 then you should set up a ci cd sprint                                 now you should check out a tutorial i                                 won't get into much of detail                                 about ci cd but ci cd is a way to                                 automatically push your code from the                                 code repository to the server with                                 testing and everything in place                                 and if scalability is a prime concern in                                 your project and you have been                                 into the all these edge then finally the                                 container comes along                                 so that it can handle everything very                                 easily and do the scaling on the fly                                 very easily                                 now this is the d-day plan which is                                 actually run down and backward                                 so that you don't have any code                                 imperfections or crashes happening while                                 you are trying to show the demo to the                                 boss the first thing starts with the day                                 minus                                                      start creating a checklist of whatever                                 things are left now from day                                             day minus                                                       checklist every three days                                 so that most of the things create a kind                                 of a pressurized environment on the                                 people and they started splitting the                                 task and                                 started creating things which are not                                 created yet                                 then on day minus three create another                                 checklist with all these things that                                 have                                 have been left and finally work uh one                                 thing at a time on day minus one to                                 check final things                                 and on day zero plan your handover so                                 everything starts with the                                 day minus                                                           person who loves to                                 stay dangerously then you can skip the                                 testing but of course you should not do                                 it                                 uh test everything that you have created                                 very well so that every nothing happens                                 on the fly                                 on the production environment so a quick                                 recap                                 so whatever we got through the first                                 principle is called less                                 whatever you do keep it less measurable                                 not                                 add a lot of things you are not                                 microsoft or google who can handle a lot                                 of                                 releases at once so just keep limited                                 things which you can easily measure                                 second principle is case which is keep                                 it simple stupid in terms of your                                 documentation in terms of your diagrams                                 in terms of your planning keep it really                                 simple                                 and the final one is don't miss it's                                 okay to miss the feature but it's not                                 okay to miss the deadline because it                                 creates a domino's effect for the future                                 sprints                                 that are going to happen so if you                                 follow all these things you should be                                 good                                 and that's what i could actually create                                 uh in this deadline                                 and ironically we finished it all the                                 time you're on time                                 exactly okay okay so briefly just just                                 jumping onto one or two questions                                 we have actually quite a few so one of                                 them was                                 i think this is about the big bricks                                 yeah                                 i love it so actually i tried to cover                                 this one so pip freeze means that if you                                 are in a virtual environment no problem                                 but if you are in a global environment                                 then freeze will take                                 all the dependencies that pip has                                 installed in your system and will import                                 it in the requirement.txt                                 no matter if your project is using it or                                 not but i found paperx is very good                                 because it goes line by line in the                                 python code and try to find all the                                 dependencies that                                 are in inside your whole project and                                 then create a pip requirements also it                                 take cares about the version which                                 cannot it takes the versions of your                                 system and also if you have any problem                                 you can just delete a requirement or txt                                 create a new virtual environment start                                 installing them again                                 so it's a good way to test if something                                 won't phase or                                 mismanage on the production environment                                 cool thanks amanda that was wonderful                                 i'm not going to the other questions
