	                              you are up next                               hey thanks let me know                               if i can see my screen enter                               screen                               able to say it yes i can please go area                               for                               and have five minutes thank you so                               what i'm going to talk about is how do                               you how do you build a code                                search engine which is primary for small                                teams and                                you know for your own personal needs                                at grammar we use gitlab to actually                                save all our repository                                um to to save all our code to repository                                and then uh you know maintain ci cd and                                and push the code regularly and so on                                but                                whenever someone wants to uh search for                                a code                                right what developers usually do is go                                to                                uh go online maybe search for a specific                                module                                and see and then modify the search                                results to see                                it's not exactly fitting their needs and                                they go to their own previous code                                uh previous code basis and try to                                find the right sample and then and then                                convert it further                                what i'm not proposing is a a very                                fine-tuned search engine                                which is specific to your need which is                                what most of our use cases are                                and and                                show you how to do that using simple nlp                                techniques                                so i'm just going to uh show you if you                                want to use                                if you want to define cache for my                                endpoints                                and whenever you you create your your                                apis you                                you don't want to paste your data each                                and every                                uh each and every time you want to catch                                it for a certain period of time                                for a certain period of time if they are                                static files like javascript                                or maybe some data files you may want to                                catch it for a long time                                maybe one year so                                and if you go to git lab and search for                                let's say how do you cache                                like because that's something you do you                                you realize that there are no results                                and then you actually need to select                                some project let's say i will select                                some project called                                running charts even here it is going to                                show me a bunch of results out of which                                i am to                                have to find out what my yaml file is                                and then then figure out the right                                snippet for that so                                instead of what discover provides is                                you can just search for the keyword                                cache and depending on whatever your                                index it's going to prompt you results                                for those from those specific projects                                and you can click the specific link and                                look for the cache                                and then and then just copy paste this                                snippet either from here or maybe from                                wherever you had the search searches                                so how does this work you can just go to                                the configure window                                uh and then add some specific project                                and then                                submit a request for for for                                indexing this is a ui aspect of it                                but in the background this is what is                                happening                                so let's say i've shown you the example                                for                                for yaml files but if you want to search                                for python files                                how do you do it you take every python                                function                                every python file and and and identify                                all the functions in the in the specific                                script                                and within each each function you you                                then identify                                the function name docstring function                                calls within the                                specific function and also the method                                calls                                 uh you then stringify each of it                                 uh maybe uh you know split it and then                                 identify if there are                                 if if the function name is let's say a                                 function underscore name maybe spread it                                 by                                 underscore i mean all these snake is uh                                 strings                                 and if you have camel k strings also                                 let's say function                                 uh function name with with end caps you                                 also split that                                 you do the same for each and every                                 string in the function name box string                                 and also the function calls and the                                 mother calls                                 and then you form the whole entire                                 string uh                                 the whole whole uh                                 document right then you do a tfidf on                                 top of that                                 what that will then give you is a matrix                                 of uh                                 matrix of rows and columns each column                                 will be your single word                                 each row is a function you're trying to                                 identify depending on how deep you want                                 to go                                 let's say maybe you want to just                                 identify the file first and then you                                 want to identify which specific function                                 am i looking for                                 um cool                                 so i i hope you liked it if you want to                                 check out go to                                 uh come up until discover workshop                                 thank you
