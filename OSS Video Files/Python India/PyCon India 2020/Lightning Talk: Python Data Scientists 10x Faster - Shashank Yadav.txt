this                               out                               yeah hi all so                               let's get started we are going to                               discuss five forest mainly                               so uh this is the                                                       for them                                i i'm from a non-tech background and                                shifted to                                technology i did some internships worked                                with opencv                                and you know deep learning and my name                                is shashank                                i'm so sorry i didn't introduce myself i                                hope you're having a great time here                                so uh pi forest is uh                                you know a library a tool which uh                                     labs has made                                for to make data scientists                                         faster and they really do that and                                i'll just show you how so i'll share my                                screen                                so i hope you can see it yeah so                                we will be discussing bamboo but we're                                short of time so it might                                you know we might overshoot so pi forest                                is an open source package                                that imports all of the python packages                                that you would normally use for a data                                science project                                like pandas matplotlib c-bond                                and i just skipped the uh bamboo lib                                section right now                                okay so as you can see there                                we're going to import by forest load a                                data set                                and we can just start using the                                libraries like                                map.lib cbon pandas etc                                and you know we don't have to import                                them separately                                no library has to be called for this no                                library has to be imported                                for uh if you're using a pie forest                                and you know uh pandas numpy seabourn                                maple lake                                uh are used uh                                i mean they are available right now                                and uh we can you know                                see for ourselves                                so as you can see we didn't have to                                import                                anything no cbone                                it is as good as importing it so                                so it is as good as importing a library                                and if we don't import it and just                                instead                                use uh pi forest                                we'll save a lot of time and using this                                has helped many people and                                you know over a few months over a month                                we a data scientist would end up saving                                a lot of time so this is really valuable                                tool you can                                keep building your projects without                                having a need for                                uh importing the libraries and let's                                now talk about bamboo lip this is a very                                interesting document about bamboo lib                                and                                we'll first go over this slide here so                                for bamboo lib now what it does is                                instead of typing the code                                you can just interact with the computer                                like a gui                                and oh you know you don't have to                                type in any code as you can see here i                                would                                give you the link in the chat so that                                you can go through it                                um since loading this would take some                                time                                can we just share this in the chat                                after your talk please go in the event                                chat and you can share                                yeah we can we will do that later we'll                                share it later                                um right now we'll just                                look at the look at how this works we                                install bamboo lip                                bam you now have to import bamboo lib                                import pandas and you can as you can see                                here you can start using                                this without writing code for                                you know displaying the data                                for any other purpose for any purpose                                 that pandas has used for exploring it                                 and these pages have not been loaded                                 okay i'm so sorry                                 okay so it's not worried this is                                 embarrassing i'm really sorry so                                 here you can see uh you know generally                                 we have to                                 use pandas for this but like you can see                                 you can filter you can drop                                 uh columns you can sort                                 the different columns without typing any                                 code                                 and once you explore it you will also                                 find that you can                                 um if you click on a button you can also                                 find the code                                 or the corresponding code which bamboo                                 uses bamboo lip uses                                 which panda sorry i'm really sorry with                                 pandas uses                                 uh along with it once you click on it                                 and you click on the code section you                                 can see the code as well                                 so this uh has saved a lot of time for                                 data scientists                                 i'm sorry over time okay okay it's fine                                 i'll share the code and                                 thanks a lot i'll share the link okay                                 bye thank you thanks
