the                                next                                                                                                      tool                                which can be used by anyone to perform                                churn analysis                                so before i uh start talking all nerdy                                here is a small introduction about us                                so i'm padma javad a huge data science                                enthusiast and a                                deep and a software developer at vmware                                so here i work for a team that enhances                                the customer service ability by                                providing proactive alerts and                                recommendations to our customers                                and bhagavad-girl is a deep learning                                engineer he has been a lead data                                scientist at many                                top notch companies and currently he is                                a founder and cto at binaz                                and to be honest he is one of the                                biggest inspiration for me                                to be in the stream of data science so                                enough about us                                so let's get directly started with the                                talk                                so this is how the outline of the talk                                is going to look like                                we'll start off with providing the                                business context behind this problem                                 we'll also look into the different steps                                 that are being followed to perform churn                                 analysis then we'll look into the                                 architecture of the tool that we're                                 building today                                 and finally if everything goes as                                 expected i'll promise you                                 a very awesome demo towards the end of                                 it                                 so let's get started so                                 uh we have seen that covered                                            a huge negative impact on the businesses                                 especially on the small scale businesses                                 and most of them have now moved                                 online and at this point of time it is                                 extremely important                                 for these businesses to ensure that most                                 of their customers are sticking with                                 their product for                                 as long as possible so in this highly                                 competitive online world businesses                                 cannot settle for                                 reactive approach where they first wait                                 for the customer to abandon their                                 product                                 only then they start taking some actions                                 it is high time we start taking some                                 proactive actions                                 where we we perform everything that we                                 can                                 in order to retain the customers for as                                 long as possible                                 right so before we dive into the exact                                 steps that are being followed to perform                                 churn analysis                                 uh let's zoom out a little bit and see                                 how exactly the                                 customer engagement life cycle looks                                 like                                 so it starts off with you advertising                                 your product                                 thereby increasing the awareness of the                                 product among the potential customers                                 right then uh those potential customers                                 they start engaging with the product                                 they start exploring the features                                 they really like the features that                                 you're providing so they even get                                 converted into paid customers                                 now you expect those customers to remain                                 loyal                                 to your product for the rest of their                                 lives now this is what you ideally                                 expect to happen but real world is never                                 ideal right                                 so that's why uh there are different                                 phases where your customers might start                                 disengaging from your                                 product and the first kind of                                 disengagement is called as customer                                 abandonment                                 so in this case the customer is really                                 impressed with the advertisement that                                 you have put out                                 so they come and they explore the                                 different features that you're providing                                 but after that point they never really                                 come back                                 so once uh so after this kind of                                 disengagement there's yet another kind                                 of disengagement called as                                 customer attrition so here the customers                                 seem to be really interested in your                                 product                                 therefore they even sign up for the free                                 trial version but                                 after the trial period gets over they                                 never really come back                                 now again this is called as customer                                 attrition and the third and the worst                                 kind of customer disengagement                                 is called as john so in this case                                 the customer is the customer whom you                                 thought was loyal                                 the customer who was using your product                                 for many many years                                 all of a sudden stop using the product                                 one day                                 now this has a huge negative impact on                                 the business because you would have                                 already invested                                 so much of your time and energy time to                                 nurture this customer                                 right trying to get this customer on                                 board for as long as possible                                 but if they stop using your product all                                 of a sudden                                 it has a huge negative impact on the                                 business and this is what                                 we will be focusing on in today's talk                                 how we can avoid                                 this exact same situation because we all                                 can agree                                 that it is much less expensive to retain                                 existing                                 existing customers than to acquire new                                 ones right                                 so uh the tool that we will be building                                 today                                 helps us identify this exact phase where                                 the customer                                 the active customer transitions from                                 being active to                                 being at risk of churning the system                                 forever                                 so our product will help will help you                                 understand the exact time frame when                                 this transition is happening                                 so uh since the beginning of the talk                                 i've been telling that it's extremely                                 important to perform churn analysis so                                 now that we have established that it's                                 important                                 to perform timely uh churn analysis                                 let's look into the exact steps that are                                 being followed                                 in order to perform the churn analysis                                 so the first                                 and the obvious step is that you have to                                 pre-process your data you have to                                 convert it into the format that your                                 machines can understand right                                 then uh then we'll be discussing                                 various different models that can be                                 used in order to perform churn analysis                                 and how you can derive predictions out                                 of the model that you have built                                 and finally i will be building a super                                 cool web application to visualize the                                 entire analysis that we have done in the                                 previous three steps                                 all right so for this presentation we                                 have used an                                 openly available data set called as                                 telecom chart which is                                 which which you can easily download from                                 kaggle                                 so here i have just picked a few                                 features                                 but in reality the data has lot more                                 features to it                                 let me tell you you can easily extend                                 the steps that i am                                 talking i will be talking in the next                                 slide to any kind of data                                 as long as you ensure that your data has                                 these three                                 features first is you need to ensure                                 that your data has                                 customer id which is the unique                                 identifier for your customer                                 then you need to ensure that the data                                 has this churn                                 uh column which says whether the                                 customer has churned or not                                 which is obvious because you are doing                                 churn analysis so and we need to have                                 this column for sure                                 and finally the most important feature                                 that you need to ensure that                                 ensure is this tenure now this                                         period                                 means slightly different for different                                 people okay for the customers who have                                 already churned                                 uh let's say for this third customer                                 this                                                              indicate that the customer has used the                                 product only for two months so the                                 entire lifetime of the customer with the                                 product was just two months                                 but whereas uh the customer who has not                                 yet churned                                 this                                                                     the customer                                 has been using the product from past                                    months                                 and will continue using the product in                                 the future so there's a subtle                                 difference between these two                                 but i think it's really important to                                 understand in order to do the correct                                 kind of prediction                                 so as long as you ensure that these                                 three features are there                                 remaining all features can be anything                                 depending on the kind of                                 uh business you are into right so again                                 depending on the type of data you can                                 perform                                 different kind of preprocessing steps on                                 it in this case as you can see most of                                 the features are categorical                                 we'll be going with the simple one-hot                                 encoding and                                 finders provides this very handy                                 function called as pd.get dummies                                 where you just have to send all the                                 categorical features and boom it creates                                 the                                 entire uh column of one hot encoded                                 uh features right so again if your data                                 contained                                 uh time series data uh which talked                                 about the way                                 your customer purchased with your                                 product then                                 you can probably use this ts fresh uh                                 package                                 which will help you create the features                                 out of your time series data                                 now again depending on your data you go                                 ahead with different kind of                                 preprocessing                                 in this case we are sticking to a very                                 basic kind of preprocessing which is                                 uh creating one hot encoding out of the                                 categorical data                                 so once we have converted the data into                                 the format that can be understood by the                                 model uh let's explore the different                                 ways                                 that uh we can use to perfor to build                                 the model right                                 so by looking at the model you can uh                                 sorry by looking at the data                                 you think that okay this is a                                 straightforward classification task                                 uh i'm so you can think that okay i'm                                 i can use a simple decision tree or                                 logistic regression to perform                                 this turn uh classification right which                                 is great                                 uh these models will tell you whether                                 the customer is going to churn or not                                 and will also give you the probability                                 with which the customer is going to join                                 but all that you are looking for in here                                 is uh                                 you're trying to build a model which can                                 tell you                                 at what exact point of time the customer                                 is going to churn                                 because you want to take the actions at                                 correct point of time                                 and that's when the survival analysis                                 models come into picture                                 so there are different kinds of survival                                 analysis models                                 uh but for this presentation we will be                                 sticking to                                 the cox proportional hazard model which                                 is the most most popular                                 uh one in the in the survival analysis                                 model                                 so um again uh python provides this very                                 useful package called as lifelines uh                                 where you can uh                                 play around with different kinds of                                 survival analysis models                                 so as i told before you can see in this                                 plot on the x-axis                                 you have                                                           y-axis you have the survival chances of                                 the customer                                 so uh you can see that the survival                                 chances of                                 one indicates that the customer has                                 loving the product                                 and will stick with the product for a                                 very long time whereas the                                 survival chances of zero indicates that                                 the customer                                 is going to join for sure so in between                                 these two periods                                 uh from the time the survival chances of                                 the customer                                 reduces from one to zero you need to                                 take some action                                 you need to send some offer to something                                 uh so that                                 you can increase so that you can                                 increase the lifetime of the customer                                 with your product right                                 so this is exactly why we are going with                                 survival analysis models it tells you                                 the exact time                                 when the specific event is going to                                 happen                                 so uh let's see how exactly we can build                                 this                                 using python although the the concept                                 might look a little complicated you can                                 see how                                 easy it is to build this model using                                 python uh                                 so all you have to do is you have to                                 import cox fitter from                                 this very famous lifelines package i                                 highly recommend you to go and go ahead                                 and                                 use this package so once you have                                 imported the model you just have to                                 split your data into training and                                 testing                                 and you have to initialize the model and                                 you just have to do model.fit and you                                 have to send the training data as the                                 first parameter                                 and then the duration column in our case                                 it's tenure                                 as the second parameter and finally the                                 event column                                 which in our case is whether                                 the customer is going to churn or not so                                 if you you just have to                                 follow these three simple line of code                                 in order to build your uh churn analysis                                 model so it is as simple as that                                 so after you have built this model if                                 you do model.plot                                 it will exactly tell you how important                                 each feature in your data set is so on                                 the x-axis                                 you can see the hazard ratio just think                                 of it as some coefficient                                 all right and on the y-axis you can see                                 the exact features that are being used                                 to train the model so all you have to                                 remember is                                 higher the hazard ratio higher the                                 chances of customer churning out                                 which is not what we want we want the                                 exact opposite                                 we want our customers to stick with the                                 product for a very long time                                 that's why we focus on the features that                                 has                                 the lesser hazard ratio right in our                                 case these are the last four feature                                 has a very low hazard ratio so now let's                                 just pick one                                 of the uh feature which is total charges                                 and see                                 how changing this feature impacts the                                 survival chances of our customer                                 so you can see the total charges has                                 decent                                 hazard ratio of zero so now                                 let's see uh how it impacts the                                 survival chances right so all you have                                 to do is                                 you have to do model dot plot partial                                 effects on outcome                                 and just send the feature that you are                                 interested to                                 learn about so here you can see the                                 black dotted line                                 indicates the baseline survival curve of                                 the data set                                 now by some chance if you just reduce                                 the total chance                                 total charges uh in the data set to zero                                 you can see the survival curve has moved                                 towards the left                                 which means the cusp the chances of                                 surviving customer surviving is                                 dropping down rapidly and it is dropping                                 right from the                                                           if you increase the total charges to                                                                      you can see that the customer is                                 sticking with the product for a very                                 long time                                 right only after                                                  chances start                                 reducing so which is obvious right like                                 if the customer is set                                 uh spending too much uh if if the                                 customer is spending a lot on your                                 uh system then it is obvious that the                                 customer is going to stick with the                                 product for a                                 very long period of time that is what                                 this graph is uh telling us                                 so ah now that we have built a model and                                 we have seen how each feature                                 ah impacts the survival chances let's do                                 the exact prediction                                 we need to know at what exact point of                                 time                                 our given customer is going to churn out                                 so that we can take a relevant action                                 before that right                                 so for that we will be looking at only                                 those customers who have not yet churned                                 but the customers who have already                                 changed you cannot really do anything                                 about that                                 so the for the customers who have not                                 yet churned they are called a censored                                 subject                                 so you all you have to do is you just                                 have to do model dot predict survival                                 function                                 and send the censored subject as an                                 input you get the entire prediction                                 of when the customer is going to churn                                 so this is how the                                 graph looks like the dotted line what it                                 indicates is the                                 is the survival chances of this specific                                 customer                                 and how it is varying over the period of                                 time you can see at                                                customer will definitely churn out                                 but there is a slight issue with this                                 prediction that the model has given                                 the model thinks that the                                                of                                                                    this customer with the product                                 which is not true as i had mentioned                                 before for the customers who have not                                 yet churned                                 this just                                                               that the customer has been using the                                 product from past                                                    continue                                 using the product therefore till                                      month                                 you're for sure you know that the                                 customer has been sticking to the                                 product right                                 therefore you have to condition your                                 prediction uh                                 by dividing each one of the value by                                 with the                                                                                                       bold line here you can see that till                                                                      month the survival chance of customer is                                 extremely high which is one only after                                 that it starts reducing                                 all right so here we have seen                                 the how the survival curve                                 of the customer is varying over a                                 different period of time                                 now if you want to take some action                                 let's say you would want to send some                                 offer when the survival chance of the                                 customer reduces by                                    then uh python provides this very simple                                 function again called as qth survival                                 times                                 so using the skewer survival times from                                 the lifelines package                                 all you have to do is you have to send                                 the percentile                                 and you have to send a conditioned graph                                 that we got in the previous                                 plot as an input and there you go you                                 will get the exact month when the                                 survival chances of this customer                                 reduces by                                    so you can see that at                                                survival chance of the customer has                                 reduced to                                    and you can see the remaining charges                                 obviously                                             multiplied by                                                          so we know that                                 we have roughly eight months uh of                                 to save this customer right so uh                                 we know that at                                                         to send some offers                                 now those offers cannot be some random                                 offer it has to be very much                                 relevant and targeted to the audience                                 that's why we again come back to the                                 future importance plot that we saw                                 in the beginning so as i had mentioned                                 before we will be                                 focusing on those features which has                                 less hazard ratio in this case                                 it is payment by credit card payment by                                 bank transfer                                 uh whether the customer has one year                                 contract or two er contact                                 if the customer has either one of these                                 four features                                 it there is a high probability that the                                 customer will use your product for a                                 very long period of time                                 now instead of just talking let's                                 exactly see                                 how each one of these features impact                                 the survivor chances                                 so again going back to this customer you                                 can see the original subscription                                 of this customer looked something like                                 this the customer had only subscribed                                 for credit card payment and had no other                                 subscription                                 so if you are sending some offer make                                 sure that                                 the customer subscribes to this two-year                                 contract so from                                 this graph you can clearly see that just                                 by getting the customer subscribe to                                 this two-year contract                                 the survival chances like more than                                 doubles from                                              as high as                                                             for other features as well                                 and also you can see that if customer                                 unsubscribes from this credit card due                                 to some reason                                 the survival chances drops so you don't                                 want that to happen                                 so till now we saw how to pre-process                                 the data how we can build the model and                                 how to send a targeted offer to our                                 customer right                                 so you are really happy with this                                 now you do the entire analysis now you                                 go ahead and present this to your boss                                 now if your presentation looks something                                 like this                                 uh all they're gonna think is what on                                 the earth is going on right                                 because this is not at all comprehensive                                 so                                 your presentation has to be such that                                 everyone                                 no matter what their background is have                                 should be able to identify what is going                                 on they should be able to                                 tell okay at this exact point of time                                 the customer is going to churn out right                                 so that's when you start thinking okay                                 fine what if i build a                                 web application out of it then you start                                 thinking okay i need to                                 start learning all this                                 web framework such as django or flask                                 and then                                 you start thinking about learning ui                                 frameworks such as                                 uh so different ui frameworks right                                 so what if i tell you uh you don't have                                 to learn or                                 any of those you can build an entire                                 end-to-end web application just using                                 python                                 so if you don't uh believe me so there                                 is this very cool package in python                                 called                                 streamlit it is the easiest and fastest                                 way to build                                 a web application using python and the                                 best part is you don't even have to know                                 any html and css for it                                 so if you don't believe me you can see                                 how simple writing the stream that code                                 is                                 so all you have to do is import stream                                 letters sd                                 and you have to keep embedding these                                 streamlet statements wherever you think                                 it's necessary                                 into your python code itself you don't                                 have to create anything                                 separately for this for example if                                 you're doing                                 a matplotlib all you have to do is                                 st.pipelot and you send the figure that                                 you have built using matplotlib and that                                 goes on to your web application                                 and if you think the plot needs some                                 explanation                                 all you have to do is you have to do                                 st.right and send                                 any write any kind of description that                                 you that you think                                 should go on the website right it is                                 as simple as that and running the                                 application is even more simple                                 all you have to do is streamlet run and                                 you have to send the                                 python file name and there you go you                                 have a                                 very nice web application running on                                 your local server                                 right so in order to make this                                 web application publicly available for                                 anyone to use on the real-time basis                                 obviously you have to deploy this on                                 cloud in our case we have deployed it on                                 heroku                                 uh so you can just follow these four                                 simple steps to deploy any                                 python applications on heroku                                 so for that you just have to ensure                                 these two files are present in your                                 project first is the requirement.txt                                 which has the names of all the packages                                 that                                 are that are required to run the                                 streamlit application                                 and uh you have this you must have this                                 proc file                                 so this proc file contains the command                                 to run the streamlet application                                 so in our case it is just streamlet run                                 and the                                 main python file name so as soon as long                                 as you have this                                 you are good to deploy your entire                                 application on cloud                                 so this is what the architecture of                                 today's demo is going to look like                                 we are going to feed in the csp file as                                 an input and we are going to build our                                 model using all these super cool                                 package that we just spoke about and                                 then we will be                                 using uh streamlet to build our web                                 application                                 so let's directly jump into our demo                                 yes so yeah this is the                                 final web application that was built and                                 you can                                 from here we'll be selecting the                                 our input file so you can see how nicely                                 it presents the entire                                 uh information on website so this is the                                 raw data that we saw                                 that our that our website                                 that our database contains and this is                                 the pre-processed data                                 and then let's go ahead and build the                                 model                                 so this is the different survival curve                                 how the survival chances varies with                                 varying total charges                                 and this was entirely built using the                                 cox proportional hazard model you can                                 read more about it here                                 and then uh we can see how the model                                 predicts you can select any customer                                 from this top term                                 uh for which you want to predict the                                 exact time when this customer might                                 churn                                 all right so let's keep the default uh                                 selection itself                                 so we can see that for this customer                                 at around                                                            going to john                                 and till around                                                   survival chances of customer is                                 completely high                                 right so you can hear we can see                                 here that at around                                            the survival chances of this customer                                 drops by                                    we can roughly see that from the graph                                 as well at around                                                  dropping to around                                                                                                        you cannot wait till the                                 till the survival chances reduces to                                    if you want to take action in the very                                 beginning                                 then you just have to increase the                                 criticality                                 okay uh just the second                                 we selected this data we built the model                                 and this is the very nice feature                                 importance                                 graph that we saw and we are making our                                 predictions                                 so if you inc                                 these the                                 [Music]                                 uh criticality of you will see the exact                                 time in this case we have increased it                                 to                                     so here we will see the exact month when                                 the to                                            all right                                 okay it just takes a while to run                                 so yeah it is coming slowly okay                                 okay at around                                                        the                                 survival chances of customer has reduced                                 to                                            and finally you can see how changing                                 each feature                                 impacts the survival chances of your                                 customer                                 right okay there are some issue but if                                 you look at the model diagnostics uh                                 ultimately you need to ensure that                                 whatever data whatever                                 uh model that you have built is good                                 enough                                 for any kind of prediction and here you                                 can see that the cust                                 for our model is predicting pretty good                                 for the lesser than your period                                 and for the higher                                                    model is not really able to                                 capture the entire essence of it which                                 is fine to some extent because                                 you would want your model to perform                                 really well                                 when the tendency of the customer to                                 churn is high which is in the beginning                                 of the                                 beginning stage of the customer life                                 cycle right so this is the entire                                 application that i've built within just                                 like a                                 day i'm sure you can do the great job if                                 with all your design skills and all                                 so if i can build this within a day                                 definitely you can do it too                                 so this is the entire summary of the                                 talk                                 we pre-process the data using pandas and                                 if you have distributed data go ahead                                 and use task                                 uh we predicted that predicted the churn                                 using it lines package                                 and then we built a web application                                 using streamlit and we finally deployed                                 all our changes on eurocode                                 if you are really interested in uh                                 playing around with this model you can                                 find                                 the entire code in here so these are the                                 references if you are interested                                 to learn more about this topic uh                                 and that's pretty much about all about                                 it uh                                 thank you so much for attending this                                 talk we are now open to taking questions                                 thank you for uh awesome talk to maja                                 um and now i                                 appreciate that you know kept it within                                 time and                                 also more from a topical study                                 a lot of people will appreciate that it                                 is                                 it doesn't actually require a lot of                                 code to go the last mile right because                                 that is the that is what people they do                                 all the fancy stuff but then they                                 struggle at the end how to deploy                                 exactly                                 [Music]                                 yeah so that was the whole idea of this                                 talk to make sure that                                 uh you not only build an amazing product                                 but you also present it in the most                                 amazing way possible                                 and with streamlit is it is definitely                                 possible to do it                                 without having to learn too many new                                 tools                                 right uh so there have been some                                 comments um during the talk um                                 all right okay what's up so one one is                                 this looks similar to our shiny so how                                 do you have an experience with our shiny                                 uh so this is like so this is like                                 literally and so of course shiny works                                 only with                                 r so this is like one take on how                                 it works but it makes a lot more you say                                 well obviously it's hard to compare                                 against shiny because shiny has been                                 around for                                 a very long time uh streamlight just                                 came it's been about for a year                                 uh but it's gone the venture route so                                 there's been a lot more                                 uh interest in terms of building this                                 and then                                 having more flexibilities but in the                                 python ecosystem                                 obviously this is the most popular one i                                 mean this is the only one that                                 provides the ease of use there is a dash                                 as well                                 so dash is predominantly for                                 dashboarding so if you think about these                                 two things                                 uh if you do dash dash is literally                                 packaging plotly and then                                 building dashboards right but what                                 streamlight provides us                                 access to apis so if you see this what                                 we have done is actually build the                                 models                                 and then provide the models as an api we                                 didn't have to explicitly go and build                                 a flask or a django app as that major                                 tool we didn't have to                                 do specific stuff okay do you know how                                 to do routing they know how to do                                 deployment                                 all those things are entirely abstracted                                 away to                                 some meaningful extent right so that                                 makes                                 it going to production that much more                                 easier and simpler                                 especially for a data scientist right                                 who doesn't have so much of                                 web skills to start with right                                 um all right so samir is asking can you                                 share the github uh can you throw up the                                 resources once more uh yeah so this is                                 the                                 link from where you can access the                                 entire code                                 yeah and um i for my part i will uh get                                 all the resources from padma and                                 bhargava and i'll put them up on this                                 room and again they'll all be on twitter                                 we'll send out the mail                                 all of those good stuff um i think we                                 are                                 excellently on time and we also have the                                 next speaker jennifer                                 in line so uh thank you so much                                 thank you for an awesome talk it was                                 very clear um i think                                 it was the pacing was perfect and it was                                 [Music]                                 i'm going to have you step down from the                                 stage so um                                 thank you
