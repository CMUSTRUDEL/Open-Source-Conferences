	                              a very energetic good afternoon to all                               the dignitaries                               and friends present here my name is                               gaurav verma                               and i work as a scientific officer with                               baba atomic source center                               first of all i would like to thank all                               the organizers of                               icon in india especially ritesh vikrant                                for helping out set up this particular                                well i had some technical issues and                                they have they were able to help me out                                in this                                so i would like to thank them a lot                                so today i'm presenting my topic which                                is                                infiniteness of finite elements it's                                prove to phoenix                                first of all i would like to start my                                presentation                                with this famous quote by a very famous                                computational scientist                                from massachusetts institute of                                technology he said                                finance meant an art to predict the                                future his name was                                jurgen bar he's a very famous man                                so here we'll talk about what is finite                                elements and what is                                infinite about it what basically is the                                what what infiniteness here what we mean                                by that                                so this is the outline of my                                presentation                                i'll be talking about the infiniteness                                of finite elements                                its exploration through the phoenix                                package                                we'll be doing some case studies here                                first case study will be on the solution                                of the heat equation                                using the phoenix package secondly the                                second case study would be                                the solution for the equation of linear                                elasticity and                                another finally there will be a summary                                of what we have presented and what we                                have talked about here                                so as you can see                                this is what do you mean by infinites                                infinitely                                infiniteness in finite elements                                basically means its infinite                                applications                                as you can see on this page there are                                four applications i have shown of final                                deletions                                have you ever wondered basically how                                when                                car manufacturers basically when they                                design a car they build a car                                and they when they before basically uh                                selling it to the market people how they                                basically arrive at such a such a                                beautiful optimum design                                they basically use this particular tool                                called finite element analysis                                this particular tool finite element                                analysis is based on a finite element                                method it's a mathematical tool which is                                which have been used by softwares to use                                for physical problems basically                                as you can see here i am showing you                                four applications first of all                                in the on my left top you can see a car                                having the doing the having the results                                solutions of displacement                                and with having a crash analysis                                and for the top right you can see it's a                                pressure vessel                                basically tank upon which when you apply                                some external loads                                external pressures how it deforms                                these colors the variation of colors                                they basically tell about the                                regions of criticality as you can see                                the red color shows                                that region is more critical and the                                blue color                                which is on the top side as you can see                                on the right side and side of the legend                                it means it's of less criticality                                now on the left you can see uh                                electromagnetic uh it's a transformer                                basically                                and using finite element model they are                                trying to                                basically estimate what are the                                temperatures one can achieve                                 in this transformer when it's working                                 and on my                                 uh bottom right you can see the model of                                 a heart                                 it's a finite element model of the heart                                 what is happening here is                                 the heart is pumping blood so they have                                 exactly modeled how a human heart is                                 and using the free structural                                 interaction module                                 they are basically showing what is                                 basically happening here                                 how the heart pumps the blood so                                 this uh finite elements basically it has                                 a name                                 word it is a word called finite in its                                 naming                                 but it has infinite applications it is                                 used                                 almost in every practical engineering                                 application                                 even people from science background use                                 it                                 so it may have a name finite elements                                 but its                                 applications are infinite so                                 basically but now we'll talk about what                                 is finite element method                                 what basically is finite element so                                 mathematical interpretation prediction                                 it is a numerical technique                                 for finding approximate solutions to                                 boundary value problems                                 for partial differential equations                                 basically what it means is that to have                                 a physical                                 system you would like to know what                                 what solutions you can achieve for that                                 you have to make a mathematical model                                 and then you have to solve that                                 mathematical model using some                                 mathematical tools like matrices and all                                 those stuff                                 and then you have to arrive at a                                 solution and physically                                 what does it have what physical                                 interpretation it has                                 basically the country what physical                                 interpretation it gives is the                                 continuous physical model                                 is divided into multiple finite pieces                                 called the elements                                 and the laws of nature are applied on                                 the generic element                                 the results are then recombined to                                 represent the container                                 basically what happens if you have a                                                                                                      have a book                                 it's a                                                                   basically a                                 rectangular cuboid you can see basically                                 any book                                 it has a big volume it can be broken                                 into multiple                                 small small small small volumes                                    volumes                                 and those                                                        can be divided into multiples let's say                                 we are dividing into multiple                                            you can uh what if you want to analyze                                 uh like                                 if you put a load on that particular                                 particular book like you put a                                 weight of your paper weight you put on                                 that book                                 how that load of the paper paperweight                                 will have an effect on the book                                 okay i'm taking just an example how will                                 that have an effect                                 this can be computed using finite                                 elements so what we tell you here                                 i'll show you the next slide basically                                 what a finite element method is                                 basically we were talking about                                 basically uh what uh                                 what is the relationship between finite                                 element method and finite element                                 analysis                                 in simple terms finite element method is                                 a method for dividing up a very                                 complicated problem                                 into small elements that can be solved                                 in relation to each other                                 it is applied to those problems which                                 either have complicated geometries                                 loadings and material properties where                                 analytical solutions are difficult to                                 achieve                                 for example as i told you earlier we                                 have taken a book                                 and we are putting a paper weight on it                                 as you are putting a paper weight on it                                 what is happening is it is getting                                 pressed at some location where the paper                                 weight is in contact with the bow                                 so now that you see this book is a very                                 uh simple structure it's a basically a                                 rectangle                                 extruded so it's a kind of a cuboid                                 but if you have a very very difficult                                 geometry like a car                                 where you have a lot of contours and a                                 lot of protrusions and extrusions and                                 all those stuff                                 there using basic mathematical laws and                                 physics physics techniques which you                                 have learned in school and colleges                                 cannot be applicable and if you want to                                 get very good results                                 like more accurate have to go towards                                 accuracies                                 then we have to use some mathematical                                 tools                                 to achieve those and those mathematical                                 tool                                 has to be solved using computers and                                 calculations may give you just few                                 numbers but                                 you have to be more accurate when you're                                 going for a                                 very something very important something                                 very costly                                 something very critical                                 so that particular thing is achieved                                 using finite elements                                 as you can see finite element analysis                                 is the application of finite element                                 method for performing numerical                                 simulations                                 now i'll fix the string                                 ah as you can see                                 how the finite element analysis works                                 i'm talking about this here                                 you see you have a physical system                                 physical system like                                 as it called either told you about a                                 book having a weight on it                                 for example a car moving at a speed of                                                                                                          this car is basically going to see some                                 drag forces because of the air which is                                 passing over it passing through it                                 basically so                                 you have this cylindrical system it has                                 to be                                 modeled mathematically in order to use                                 mathematical tools                                 it has to have a simple mathematical                                 representation                                 how will you idealize the whole physical                                 continuum into a mathematical model                                 that needs to be done then after that                                 that mathematical model is further                                 discretized into more simpler                                 uh simpler elements using finite element                                 methods                                 and then you find solution for those                                 discrete model                                 using the finite element tools and other                                 numerical techniques                                 you find the solutions for those and                                 once if you see if this okay                                 then it's fine and otherwise if you find                                 that some there are some more fittings                                 required                                 then you again remodel the whole                                 car thing with more uh intricacies and                                 you come out with a solution                                 and it's an attentive process until                                 unless you are                                 very much satisfied and you have a gut                                 feeling that now                                 this design will work and it's okay and                                 you have done a lot of tests on it                                 also so as to validate whatever you're                                 done is correct or not                                 then you have achieved your solution so                                 all we have gone through we have taken a                                 physical system which is basically a car                                 it can be articulate let's take a car we                                 have uh                                 uh we have ordered that car physically                                 on a computer                                 let's take a computer and we have to                                 model that car                                 then we take the whole model and divide                                 that a particular mode into small small                                 elements                                 and then what we do using those you                                 solve for                                 each element you solve whatever the                                 loadings are that are                                 on that element and then you                                 get a solution for it and then what you                                 do                                 ultimately also all the elements you                                 combine the solution                                 and you get the solution for the whole                                 car                                 how will it be so this is how the final                                 element basically works                                 now how does finite elements as                                 i say as i spoke earlier how it was                                 basically in finite element                                 analysis the continuum or the physical                                 system                                 or the model is represented as an                                 assembly of smaller subdivisions called                                 finite elements                                 and together they are called the mesh as                                 you can see on the right                                 is a small uh geometry which i have                                 divided into a number of small pieces                                 or these are basically uh rectangular                                 pieces as you can see these are called                                 meshes                                 each rectangular piece is called an                                 element and together are called image                                 these elements are interconnected at                                 nodes at the points where they are                                 connected                                 those are called nodes and basically we                                 find solution for those node values                                 the nodes usually lie on the element                                 boundaries and are shared with adjacent                                 or the neighboring connected elements                                 the mesh is programmed to contain the                                 material and structural properties                                 which define the behavior of the                                 structure under certain loading                                 conditions                                 as i told you when you make the model of                                 the car                                 could be made up of some kind of steel                                 something alloy would be                                 so you have to put that material                                 property of that                                 steel on that model so that when you                                 apply a loading                                 it it has an effect of that particular                                 uh                                 material you see because otherwise you                                 don't put any material you won't get any                                 enzymes                                 it's just like putting something uh some                                 some loading on something which has no                                 property                                 that that should not happen you have to                                 put a                                 material model what kind of material it                                 is is it a steel                                 is it aluminum is it something else is                                 it whatever it is                                 so you have to put a material model on                                 that and you put some loading                                 loading could be a force a could be a                                 pressure                                 or could be some kind of a displacement                                 placement means some kind of a                                 radiation you put so that could be that                                 has to be put on it                                 and then you are able to get a solution                                 for this so                                 so now we will say how this finite                                 element analysis works                                 how it works basically now this nodes                                 are distributed with certain density                                 throughout the model depending on the                                 anticipated resolution                                 level on a particular area the mesh is                                 programmed to contain the material and                                 structural properties                                 which define the behavior of the                                 structure under certain loading                                 conditions                                 the variation of the field variable it                                 could be temperature displacement                                 pressure velocity                                 etc in the model is defined determined                                 by approximating the variation of the                                 field variables inside an element by a                                 simple interpolation function                                 also called the basis function basically                                 what is saying it's saying here                                 that what you want to determine in that                                 particular car model if you take and you                                 have put some                                 uh some material on it and you're                                 applying some loading                                 what do you want to determine in that                                 thing it's like you do you want to                                 determine                                 what the displacements are going to be                                 like what deformation it can take                                 for example if you take a car model and                                 you it you're traveling on a                                    kilometer per hour                                 speed and hit the barrier to hit                                 like a crash test basically what we do                                 so what do you want to do                                 do you want trouble how much energy how                                 much deformation                                 is happening on this car or something                                 that is                                 your field variable the primal variable                                 and that you have to determine that's                                 what is mentioned here                                 and since you have put you have taken                                 appropriate                                 mathematical model to model particular                                 this thing                                 you have taken the correct material                                 properties they are applied direct                                 loadings basically the pressure load of                                 the force zone                                 you get the correct value of energy                                 absorbed by the car                                 or the displacement that the car is                                 facing or seeing                                 or whatever you can achieve that using                                 finite elements                                 differential equation of any order                                 cannot be solved                                 that's very difficult for and                                 particularly for very complex geometries                                 it's very difficult                                 so what you do you simplify that                                 physical model                                 sorry if you simplify that uh                                 differential equation                                 what you do is basically you uh simplify                                 it                                 bringing bring the order down like if                                 you have a second order differential                                 equation                                 you're bringing the order to the first                                 order so that it becomes                                 easy for you that that                                 lowering of the order that is what is                                 called the weak form                                 the original equation which you have is                                 called a strong form and when we lower                                 the order it's called the weak form                                 now what happens you uh you use this                                 weak form                                 for finite element methods as                                 the basic governing equation for which                                 you are going to solve the                                 solve the solve the solution for which                                 you're going to get the results                                 so that's right that's the weak formula                                 i'm talking about                                 so and how do you solve it you apply a                                 lot of mathematical tools like                                 you make matrixes matrices and you find                                 out                                 stiffness matrix and all those stuff                                 therefore mathematical terms                                 uh so what you want to happen is you                                 take you form these                                 matrix equations and all those defined                                 for each node                                 as i told you that each element                                 at its boundary have multiple nodes                                 connected to it so you find those values                                 at each node                                 and you try to find what are the                                 solutions like the displacement energy                                 and whatever you want                                 uh is is the value on that particular                                 node                                 that you try to find out                                 next uh so i'll tell you next thing                                 how this finite element analysis health                                 designers                                 basically the new age designers who are                                 coming after doing some uh                                 mechanical engineering and civil                                 engineering                                 after they are basically engineering                                 courses undergraduates                                 or anyone in first part people from                                 people from                                 r d of a car company or uh uh                                 like in in my particular organization                                 like uh power auto center where we have                                 uh                                 we make uh nuclear reactors basically so                                 how that helps                                 so what happens is this finite element                                 helps that it makes our life very simple                                 it somewhat replaces the need for an                                 extensive and expensive physical                                 experiments                                 because for each thing you're gonna do                                 an experiment like if you want to                                 uh if you want to uh model like for a                                 car                                 you do crash test analysis that is okay                                 but for like a rocket                                 will you uh how much how much can                                 experiment can you do                                 you cannot really fly a real a real size                                 rocket and                                 crash it somewhere and see what can                                 happen to the material of it                                 so there you do a scaled down test                                 that's okay and parallelly                                 those tests are compared with the                                 results of the finite elements                                 and seen how these results are secondly                                 it is easily applied to complex                                 irregular shaped objects                                 composed of different materials and                                 having complex boundary conditions                                 like if you have very complex geometry                                 like very different difficult contours                                 handheld hand solved uh problems uh and                                 uh                                 using hand calculations or calculators                                 it will be very difficult to                                 get the accurate results you might get                                 somewhat closer than                                 with uh                                                                could be there but                                 if you want a very accurate uh you might                                 have to                                 you won't be possible using pen and                                 paper you might have to use some                                 numerical technique and secondly                                 actually it is applicable to both linear                                 non-linear problems                                 what do you mean by that like problems                                 where input and output behave linearly                                 like whatever given input if your                                 given output is linearly proportional to                                 it that is called a linear problem                                 for example uh uh you can take                                 an example like like particularly you                                 see                                 if on the book the more uh the                                 early problem we have taken we've taken                                 a book                                 we have put up a paper weight on it the                                 more you                                 apply the more heavy weight your paper                                 where you apply on the book                                 the more deformation the book will see                                 about depression kind of thing with the                                 book see                                 that is the linearity nonlinear problems                                 are much                                 a bit difficult difficult and different                                 where                                 the relation is not linear for example                                 fluid                                 those problems are highly nonlinear and                                 this                                 and this finite element analysis is                                 applied to wide variety of                                 problems like solid mechanics fluid                                 mechanics electromagnetics biomechanics                                 transfer etc so it has really a                                 wide application                                 now we'll talk about phoenix software                                 this phoenix package which we are                                 offering                                 first of all it's an open source package                                 it's a python based uh software which                                 basically solves the partial                                 differential equations                                 using python and c plus the library                                 basically we have a lot of libraries                                 made for this and we basically if you                                 want to do some calculation or we do                                 a particular type of problem solve to                                 solve a problem                                 then we particularly import a particular                                 module                                 a particular library and then uh                                 using those library whatever tools are                                 there in the library we try to find out                                 the solution                                 and then now if you talk about phoenix                                 it is an automated programming                                 environment for differential equations                                 basically                                 if you know what phoenix there is i'll                                 explain in the further slides of                                 how it helps us phoenix provides a high                                 level user interface which allows easy                                 reproduction of                                 mathematical formulation and rapid                                 implementation of high performance                                 solvers                                 so instead then phoenix was basically                                 the phoenix was created in                                      under scenic's research and software                                 project in collaboration with similar                                 research laboratory                                 university of cambridge university of                                 chicago texas technical university ath                                 royal institute of                                 login some code                                 okay slides are not changing                                 but i'll try to it                                 i'll rebroadcast myself so that                                 sugar some you know we were expecting                                 some glitches sometimes you know we're                                 all connected from home so                                 that's all right i think it's now it's                                 available yeah                                 so basically what's happening is uh this                                 finnish platform was created with uh                                 basically with uh it's a people project                                 taken up                                 in the year                                                           and technical universities                                 around the world and they together                                 developed it and it's an open source                                 package it's freely available in the                                 internet and                                 it has literally wide and very it's very                                 powerful                                 first of all and it has a lot of epic it                                 it solves a lot of problems                                 physical problems physical and                                 engineering problems                                 so this is the basic architecture                                 of the phoenix application you can see                                 on the left hand side you have this                                 phoenix application in the yellow box                                 then you have this interface green color                                 box you can see that interface is                                 dolphin                                 so basically what dolphin is                                 is called performance dynamic object                                 oriented library                                 for finite element computations it's a                                 basically c plus plus python library                                 i just prime and it is a primary user                                 interface                                 then you again have other core                                 components like ufl                                 ffc ufc                                 these are the four this is these are the                                 core components these are the libraries                                 which are part of the phoenix                                 application but then there are external                                 libraries                                 like numpy which many of you are                                 familiar with                                 let us see last celebsi emf pack and so                                 on                                 btk and all this mitigation particular                                 uh                                 review image so                                 you have a lot of these uh libraries we                                 have to import                                 so as to get the uh lists                                 now what is the advantage of phoenix                                 phoenix basically is an automated fem                                 automated fm means                                 basically as i told you earlier that we                                 have elements and we try to find out                                 we have nodes and there we are basically                                 we find out the solution at those nodes                                 so what happens that we make all this                                 matrix matrices are formed basically                                 when you use                                 sr phoenix but however when you're using                                 phoenix uh                                 don't have to uh when a coding then you                                 would have to make all these papers and                                 all that                                 it's like it's when you write the code                                 and you using the weak form                                 it automatically gets it in that                                 particular thing                                 then we have this automated evaluation                                 of variational forms automated finite                                 element assembly                                 automated adaptive error control which                                 has so many other advantages you can see                                 these are the type of elements when you                                 describe a discretized                                 geometry a                                                       geometry or a surface geometry                                 these are the type of type of elements                                 which are applica which are                                 used in phoenix then some more elements                                 are here presented here as you can see                                 now we'll do one uh this thing uh we'll                                 do one                                 case study we'll talk about how the                                 phoenix is applied                                 like uh how the phoenix works basically                                 uh we are solving a poisoning what                                 poisoning equation is basically that                                 uh it's a kind of a uh there's any kind                                 of equation which is there like                                 and you're putting some beat and uh                                 distribution is that can be uh basically                                 some form of poisoning equation it is so                                 that can be                                 easily uh being uh but we can solve                                 that by poison equation and you can                                 easily get results                                 then uh you see like and then you have                                 the weak form basically that is a second                                 order equation                                 lower it down to a first order equation                                 and you solve it                                 using this this much amount of coding is                                 this this is a python code                                 recording and uh this much on the coding                                 is required                                 and you get the results basically how                                 the temperature distribution is                                 then again uh this is the linear                                 equation                                 like you take a beam you put some load                                 in one end and you fix the beam                                 on the other side how the that beam is                                 deflecting                                 how the behavior is that can be uh                                 basically                                 solved using a stretch using this uh                                 linear elasticity coding                                 and you can show it to other you can                                 give credits for this also                                 this kind of coding will be required                                 it's a again a                                 a patent-based thing and when you                                 implement all these uh this coding uh                                 sort of programs then                                 ultimately you get this solution like                                 how that                                 beam is deflecting you see how the beam                                 has deflected when i apply i fixed at                                 one side                                 and putting the loading on the other                                 side this is the case                                 some of the work done by us like this is                                 the fuel assembly                                 we try it's a nuclear field basically we                                 try to find out the natural vibration                                 using this fuel assembly                                 so what we do is this is the fuel                                 assembly called geometry you can see                                 these are the uh the ones which are                                 styled rectangular                                 these are called fluids we try to find                                 the natural frequency                                 and we have done that using phoenix this                                 is the approach we have used at the                                 diagram for the algorithm which we have                                 used and we have tried out                                 try to find out this solution like i'll                                 show you here this is the                                 fuel plates which are there we have tied                                 out the natural frequency how the                                 frequency                                 what the frequencies are for each                                 particular                                 plate for a given attack boundary                                 condition                                 if the plate is uh fixed on one side how                                 the plate will behave                                 what will it secure natural frequency                                 how those things we have found out using                                 uh this chaining software some more                                 results are here can be seen uh                                 so this is summary that finite element                                 analysis is one of the most vital                                 analysis techniques in engineering                                 technology applied sciences and its                                 popularity is expected to grow manifold                                 in the coming years                                 finite element method is a mathematical                                 tool for solving partial differential                                 equations                                 generally referred as pdes phoenix is a                                 powerful open source package                                 for solving pdes and was created with an                                 aim of                                 automated solution to mathematical                                 models so finite element methods                                 allowing easy reproduction of                                 mathematics formulation                                 and bracket implementation of high                                 performance solvents here we have seen                                 two kind of case studies                                 uh where we have used phoenix to find                                 the solution one was a kind of a heat                                 equation                                 and second was the elasticity equation                                 so that's all                                 these are the differences i have taken                                 literature references                                 other sources for the images i have                                 already mentioned                                 so thank you thanks a lot                                 take care of the great section thank you                                 yeah so could you also share your                                 camera yeah                                 wait yeah                                 we can initially face some                                 tech issues and great job resolving it                                 and getting back on the stage                                 yeah so quite quite an interesting topic

      interesting questions                                 um yeah if you're out of time maybe you                                 could                                 uh answer the controller yeah                                 yeah i just had one in question myself                                 okay so what what                                 the difference between uh sweeping and                                 phoenix hp                                 sfe there's a module                                      that's also for fps                                 uh actually basically uh first of all i                                 didn't name the get the name of that                                 particular software talking about                                 phoenix                                 hr sfp yeah sap okay i'm not                                 aware of this particular software                                 basically uh again it might be                                 an open source package basically there's                                 not not much difference                                 basically what happens here i'll tell                                 you what happens that every software                                 which is made                                 in a university level or thing it has an                                 objective                                 what kind of problem it wants it wants                                 to solve like uh                                 for example if you take any commercial                                 software like analysis you might have                                 heard of it                                 from that and any other software like                                 distinct                                 console so generally what                                 people see is console that particular                                 software is very good for solving                                 multiple problems                                 like even ansys can solve anything it                                 has a powerful                                 it has a potential for that also but now                                 this uh                                 console amps which the commercial                                 software is finally used it's a very                                 multiplex tool                                 it's like uh when you have a lot of                                 different fields interacting with each                                 other like a fluid hitting a                                 structure for the water hitting the                                 structure or                                 a like a sound propagating through a                                 solid or a liquid or medium                                 those kind of problems are each bit                                 easier to solve                                 in computer multi phase compared to                                 answers                                 however if you have a very difficult                                 problem yeah give it a very difficult                                 problem like uh                                 if you have like i thought you know                                 about number of meshes by the number of                                 elements you want to discretize                                 if you have like uh in millions like uh                                 in a                                    or                                                                      difficult                                 it has uh it has a potential i'm sure                                 but what we have seen in our offices                                 like                                 we generally go for answers for this                                 kind of problem which are heavy problems                                 like                                 you want to uh model very intricate                                 particular                                 areas of volumes or lines so                                 every software which is uh                                 yeah but i think we are on time yeah                                 maybe uh                                 you know the viewers are really happy to                                 go ahead and explore phoenix
