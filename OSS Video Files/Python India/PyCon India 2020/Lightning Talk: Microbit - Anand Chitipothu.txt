                   yeah sorry i couldn't figure out how to                                share the screen but                                going to talk about bbc micro bit                                yeah so this is a device called bbc                                micro bit                                small micro computer that can run python                                back in                                                       us uk pycon uh                                there was a demo of micro bits and i                                grabbed some of them from the organizers                                there                                and i've been using it on and off i did                                a session at pycon india                                after coming back from there uh and i've                                been giving it to uh kids that i know                                so do you because the pandemic uh uh                                my kids and uh kids from extreme family                                have been like not doing much                                uh having getting bored i thought let me                                choose programming so i took this thing                                and then                                uh introduced them for a week and they                                were quite excited and then uh                                started playing with so i'm going to                                show some of the interesting things that                                you can do with this                                before i get started let me kind of show                                what this device is about okay                                so this is a this is a device this                                device                                runs python natively and uh the                                it has very simplified interface you can                                see there's a five by five                                uh leds here and the two buttons                                and then there are uh extensions that                                you can connect any hardware to                                so this is a program that my daughter                                has written which basically                                she made a dice so you click on the                                button a that means this button                                it will roll a random number and then                                show the number that you can actually                                show                                so you can actually show different icons                                on the screen                                and it can support different gestures                                it can you can shake it you can                                throw up and down and you can show                                different icons                                i'll show you that in a minute so this                                is                                uh it is kind of showing a                                message on launch                                and when you press a button                                so i have some kids at home they have                                built all that i'm going to ask them to                                kind of show at                                the mic can you show what is this how                                does this work                                this is representing a smiley icon when                                you press                                button a uh it shows uh                                icon heart which blinks okay                                and when you shake it uh it shows                                and i can confuse symbol it's in a                                confused state actually                                so so what you can do is you can                                basically uh so these are things that                                kids have picked up uh in a week or two                                uh this can be programmed in block                                language python                                and javascript so uh                                so this you can play with these buttons                                and uh so i've seen two of the examples                                i'm going to other example                                this uh there's another small little uh                                circuit you can see here uh                                it's a micro bit connected to a ba uh                                that's that's driving that circuit which                                is a                                uh traffic lights uh i'll ask                                uh so she'll explain what is that hello                                everyone                                this is traffic light circuit if we                                press button a the the                                traffic speed the speed will increase                                if we press button b the speed will                                decrease                                 if we press both button a and b it comes                                 to the normal position                                 yeah so the reason i'm kind of showing                                 all this is uh these are the kids                                 with no programming background at all                                 and within a couple of weeks they could                                 actually pick it                                 and do all of that the other interesting                                 thing is it's really uh                                 gives a lot of motivation to kind of try                                 new things and then uh                                 learn programming do other stuff that's                                 it's it's so                                 that's about it okay so i would say like                                 if you look at some of these kids that                                 i'm talking with rick uh they wouldn't                                 consider themselves really smart                                 et cetera they kind of consider that                                 they're very uh                                 they don't really like mathematics etc                                 so there are typical bite kits that you                                 can think about right i mean anyone                                 who kind of get a simple device like                                 that and then start playing with that i                                 think that gives a lot of encouragement                                 and motivation to try new things                                 so it's a wonderful device if you ever                                 want to introduce programming to any kid                                 think about it uh people micro bit uh                                 this is now available also on amazon so                                 you can buy it as well                                 and yeah that's it and i'm planning to                                 do a buff uh sometime tomorrow on                                 microwave and                                 other hardware so please join and                                 yeah that's all i'm done thank you so                                 much
