                    um but there are things that i think i                                think                                need to be said sometimes so i guess i'm                                i'm going to try and say them                                um this is based a little bit                                on a talk i also gave it at euro python                                a few months ago somebody mentioned that                                on twitter and                                uh this sort of starts from the same                                point but                                i've been thinking about these issues uh                                a fair amount for the past six months                                and as i continue to think this is kind                                of                                where i'm at now and um it's called                                inclusion in community in the face of                                crisis                                i guess maybe it should have been called                                resilience                                inclusion and community in the face of                                crisis but that starts to get to be too                                long a title to fit on a slide                                um and um you know of course speaking of                                the slides                                uh you will see a bitly link                                to the slides uh on this page and it's                                at the bottom of every page so if you                                want to go look at the slides for what                                they're worth                                uh you can do that at at any time                                so um yeah well let's let's go ahead                                so as as mentioned i i used to be chair                                uh of the psf and                                um i stepped aside as of um                                the end of june this year um before that                                i'd been share the psf for three years                                i'd been                                on the board uh for five years and that                                certainly                                seemed to me that was probably enough                                and i i also believe                                that um organizations that are                                um sort of open and run by                                uh by volunteers uh like                                like the psf but also like i know a lot                                of open source software projects                                uh if they're going to be sustainable                                they need to actually                                practice changing leadership and the                                only way that could happen                                uh would be if the leaders step aside so                                i do want to say that i was                                i was very proud to be a part of the                                board um                                here we are at our last in-person board                                meeting for who knows how long                                uh which occurred in amsterdam last                                november so                                nearly a year ago                                and you know it wasn't only that i had                                been planning to                                to step aside as as psf chair i had a                                lot of plans                                about a year ago um of course i was                                was looking forward to going to pike on                                us                                um there are many things that i helped                                create at pycon us                                the the poster session education summit                                and the sprints intro you know things                                like that                                the the charles and the hatchery and all                                this so i was i was                                i was looking forward to going there and                                kind of like a a proud parent a proud                                grandparent kind of looking on at some                                of that stuff                                um and you know i was going to go to                                 pycon latam which was going to be in                                 puerto vallarta mexico it's going to be                                 a great time i                                 i already had as of late january i had                                 my plane ticket for pycon                                 spain uh which happens this weekend                                 uh and in fact i guess virtually i will                                 be at pike on spain tomorrow so                                 um i guess in this in this crazy world                                 of                                 of the current current days um                                 it's at least possible that i now can be                                 more or less in two places at one time                                 um i'd even actually just i i had                                 even uh done a painting of pi ladies                                 logos that i was going to give to the                                 auction                                 the pie ladies auction at pycon us i i                                 hand                                 painted                                                                this is the                                 the top half of the painting uh it's                                 it's hanging behind me right above my                                 head now as i speak                                 maybe someday i will get a chance to                                 actually donate that to someone                                 but to me and to everybody else                                 then                                               uh and along with it uh                                 of course covet                                         um this had um a lot of things i think i                                 was like a lot of people in that                                 late january early february i thought                                 okay this                                 this is going to be a bit of an                                 inconvenience but this is going to                                 going to go away i you know i wonder uh                                 how much inconvenience it will be                                 whatever                                 and then as as we kept on moving through                                 uh february it kept looking more and                                 more serious and i think                                 by by the late february i was like oh                                 this this might not be good um and then                                 i was thinking                                 or hoping that at least maybe we would                                 be able to have pycon us                                 before uh the the virus                                 got too bad uh and                                 i kept watching the numbers i mean this                                 is the thing with us as programmers we                                 can write little programs to figure out                                 all sorts of things i figured out                                 probabilities of infection and things                                 like that and by                                 the beginning of march it was like oh no                                 this is not going to work this is going                                 to be much worse than we feared                                 uh and certainly i would say by the end                                 of the first week of march                                 i pretty much knew that there was no way                                 we were going to have pike on us                                 or much of any other                                 much of any other pycons in person                                 and of course                                 as as chair of the psf at the time this                                 is kind of an awful position to be in                                 because                                 the psf the python software foundation                                 relies on                                 uh pycon us profits to fund                                 you know something in the neighborhood                                 of                                                         of its income its operating expenses uh                                 you know the the the grants we were                                 giving the support for the core                                 development sprints                                 uh just you know keeping the                                 infrastructure of pipei running paying                                 our staff all of those things come from                                 the money from pycon and it looked like                                 we were going to have to cancel                                 and this is one of these things that                                 i don't think people understood at the                                 time                                 we waited until late march to cancel                                 pycon not                                 because we didn't know we had to cancel                                 people were tweeting at us what's wrong                                 with you don't you care about your                                 people                                 um but the fact was if we would have                                 canceled before                                 the local and regional governments of                                 pittsburgh made it impossible for us to                                 hold the conference                                 we would have owed we would have lost                                 more than half a million dollars which                                 would have been                                 a serious problem for the python                                 software foundation                                 we have two years of reserve we could                                 have kept running but that would have                                 meant                                 uh that that we would have taken a big                                 hit                                 on that reserve which would have                                 potentially particularly as things are                                 unfolding now                                 had had other implications down the road                                 so we had to wait                                 until the local government declared that                                 we could not hold pycon                                 and they were very slow to do that                                 and in the meantime we on the board                                 couldn't even say this is what we were                                 doing because                                 if we were to do that then that could be                                 held against                                 us as saying we we intended to cancel                                 the conference no matter what and we                                 would still have been on the hook                                 so we were there unable to say anything                                 about it but we had to wait                                 uh and and finally then uh in                                 the latter part of march we we got that                                 word from                                 um from pittsburgh and pennsylvania                                 officials and we closed down officially                                 uh and and we were we were finally in                                 the clear                                 to go ahead and and do that and                                 um it was i think                                 that was probably one of the most                                 stressful months                                 of my life to be honest thinking about                                 what this means                                 for uh the psf for the community for the                                 things that we try to do                                 as well as just the whole experience of                                 the conference so                                 for so many people uh having to go away                                 but you know i think if that was the                                 worst that                                              looking back now we would be okay                                 uh in fact of course as we all know                                 it got worse um we had                                 outbreaks you know outbreaks in europe                                 outbreaks in the u.s                                 uh and and then they continued to spread                                 around the world from there                                 uh that led to quarantines lockdowns                                 travel bans um you know i                                 i'm now getting uh ads from from                                 airlines asking me to                                 to to to fly where would i fly there's                                 no place i can go now without having a                                 quarantine requirement                                 um and you know if that weren't enough                                 uh in uh in minneapolis in in late may                                 uh a                                 a a policeman uh killed a black man                                 and that triggered racial                                 and and social um protests                                 um throughout the united states but that                                 seemed to spill out and happen in a lot                                 of other places around the world                                 uh i think you know that's not the only                                 thing driving protests around the world                                 either there there have been sort of a                                 a fair amount of of unrest so we had                                 all of that stuff that just sort of                                 basically kept piling on                                 we thought it was bad in march man it                                 it's it's certainly                                 uh managed to get worse so                                 yeah that's kind of my point these are                                 hard times uh                                 these are times that that actually work                                 to pull us apart they make it in some                                 ways if you look at it uh                                 harder to to you know bring our                                 communities together to build our                                 communities                                 we can't get together in person anymore                                 there's                                 there are lots of of things that are                                 causing people                                 fear there are is is lots of of conflict                                 in the world                                 all of these things are kind of adding                                 up                                 in many ways to hard times and                                 yeah it just gets worse there are more                                 hard times to come of course                                 the virus will get worse i think we're                                 now starting to head into what looks                                 like a second or third wave                                 here in the u.s it's not really like                                 we're heading into the second or third                                 wave we're just continuing                                 the first one only more so um                                 we have managed to see governments                                 around the world demonstrate                                 a shocking inability to manage this                                 thing correctly                                 if you're looking at the at the u.s news                                 that came in overnight i you know don't                                 know that                                 um we have yet another piece of evidence                                 of that here in the u.s                                 and i i don't wish anybody ill                                 but this is what's been going on um                                 and of course we have now had worldwide                                 uh a million deaths um you know                                                                                                         it it's there's there's just a lot of                                 there's a lot of virus stuff that is                                 is still ahead of us                                 and you know that also has                                 economic considerations it has economic                                 considerations in general it has                                 economic considerations for us as a                                 python                                 community globally and in in our various                                 countries and regions                                 uh we have always been well not always                                 but for the past                                 i don't know                                                          kind of in a lucky position                                 being being programmers being coders                                 understanding technology                                 our skills have been increasingly in                                 demand                                 companies have been willing to spend                                 increasing amounts of their budget                                 to um you know to                                 to attract us as employees uh                                 that includes not only uh a a                                 a positive trend in salaries but also                                 these companies have been                                 been willing to spend to support our                                 communities and our events                                 to keep us happy uh so that we would                                 consider working for them                                 and now i think you know we're seeing                                 various degrees of recession and                                 depression                                 uh hitting and in spite of some                                 misguided optimism                                 uh things aren't as bad maybe as they                                 were a few months ago                                 but the effects of this are going to be                                 with us                                 for for quite a while and again i don't                                 think that we've seen the end                                 of the down part of this yet i think we                                 will see more companies struggle                                 that's going to mean that for us as a                                 python community                                 as well as other communities and other                                 other things                                 you know wherever uh we're going to                                 not have the resources available                                 that we used to uh and of course on a                                 personal level                                 i have known i know a lot of people who                                 have been laid off or have had                                 salary cuts uh that sort of thing so on                                 a personal level this is going to be                                 very serious                                 for us even though we're relatively                                 privileged being in technology                                 and then for the greater communities of                                 course it                                 has been varying degrees of devastating                                 um so yeah and i think actually with                                 today's news                                 the stock market is looking like that                                 again too i haven't really checked                                 that's what i've heard um                                 and this kind of feeds into                                 something else that is is going on these                                 days which is this                                 rising tide of of polarization                                 of an us versus them mentality                                 and along with that feeding off of that                                 i think we've got                                 um populist and and and well honestly                                 repressive                                 uh governments around the world who will                                 be trying to exploit                                 um everything else the the virus and all                                 of the other problems we're having                                 uh and you know use that                                 along with you know sort of the the                                 rising sort of current of xenophobia                                 uh and and i think we will see all sorts                                 of                                 of marginalized groups be demonized be                                 repressed have their rights taken away                                 from um you know anything from migrant                                 workers                                 to minorities i think there will                                 probably be a religious component                                 certainly will affect                                 women probably in a negative way                                 the lgbt population i think pretty much                                 any marginalized group that you can                                 think of is likely to be a target as                                 governments try to exploit                                 uh this sort of current of of                                 polarization populism                                 and combine that with the problems                                 caused by                                 by the current crisis uh it it's just                                 has the potential in many many places to                                 be a very bad scenario                                 so yeah these are scenes that we                                 probably will see for a while                                 and of course if that weren't enough                                 um we have climate change                                 starting to make itself more and more                                 known                                 and this is everything from weather uh                                 catastrophes                                 um you know again for example what i see                                 a lot of here in the u.s                                 we've run out of letters of the alphabet                                 to name                                 uh hurricanes and tropical storms in the                                 atlantic                                 which has only happened once or twice                                 before and we're not even at the end of                                 the season yet                                 as well as kind of the creeping                                 description we see from                                 from drought and other things as well as                                 various spots around the world uh                                 suffering from from wildfires like never                                 before                                 and you know i'm thinking um it's the                                 west coast of the us                                 uh it's the amazon in brazil                                 uh it's australia it's many other places                                 that that you know i i don't even                                 haven't heard of but it's                                 it's again becoming a an increasing                                 and increasing problem so                                 i think even the final bit of bad news                                 i've got for you and i promise i'm                                 coming towards the end of the bad news                                 is that uh even if we get a new normal                                 and you know there are there are                                 glimmers                                 of hope for vaccines and treatments for                                 the virus                                 even if we get a new normal i don't                                 think the new normal is going to be very                                 normal for a while                                 i think we're looking at years of after                                 effects                                 there will certainly be reduced travel                                 even if we were to cure everyone of the                                 virus tomorrow                                 the the damage that the airline industry                                 has undergone                                 with layoffs everywhere with planes                                 being shut down                                 with the the losses and money all of                                 that sort of thing                                 i think it will even under ideal                                 conditions                                 take the travel industry years to                                 recover i think we're looking at years                                 where                                 uh travel is going to be expensive it's                                 going to be difficult                                 and yeah there just will be less of it                                 similarly i wish i could tell you when i                                 expected to see                                 uh large conferences in person i love                                 going to pycons i                                 i really wish i could say when but                                 honestly i think it's going to be                                 it's going to be a while and i i                                 deliberately leave that vague but                                 i it will probably be longer than than                                 than we expect before we have                                 much of anything in the way of                                 conferences they will be smaller                                 they may be online or they may be kind                                 of a mixture of both                                 but i think things like you know pycon                                 us was                                                                   to be a while                                 before we see that uh and you know as we                                 move into                                 the new normal as i've mentioned and and                                 sort of                                 try to live in our bubbles i think as i                                 mentioned we're going to see fewer                                 resources for a lot of things                                 including uh tech communities and i've                                 already mentioned                                 the the strain that this will will put                                 on the job market                                 so it is no secret                                 that i am i am quite old uh                                 i uh am probably older than most of the                                 people listening to this                                 and um i can remember                                 um the times of the                                                      there seemed to be a lot of conflict and                                 a lot of problems in the world                                 and you know i think already we have                                 we have gone well beyond anything that i                                 can remember from the                                             what this recalls to me more is                                 what i heard from my parents who                                 um grew up and came of age                                 in the                                                                depression                                 and world war ii i think that this is                                 going to have                                 similar consequences and there you know                                 this is like consequences there will be                                 obviously economic consequences uh there                                 will be                                 social consequences that i can't begin                                 to speculate about                                 um educational consequences there will                                 be all sorts of things                                 not not since the                                                     has there been an event like this                                 and i think that this uh this event                                 this this crisis will have an impact                                 that will will have a generational                                 impact                                 we're talking not in terms of recovering                                 in months or years but probably decades                                 honestly                                 and so yeah we're all                                 in a position where we are put where we                                 have to deal with loss of some sort                                 and for for some people this could be                                 a loss of friends and loved ones um                                 many others it will be a loss of                                 employment                                 for virtually all of us losses of                                 experiences and of doing things that we                                 love and enjoy                                 for virtually all of us uh to some                                 degree                                 a loss of of our connections with others                                 and and we all have to deal with those                                 things                                 like it or not so                                 how how do we carry on uh how do we                                 how do we process these feelings of loss                                 and grief and and then how do we move                                 forward                                 um or                                 another way of putting it is how do we                                 find that resilience                                 to keep going and recover                                 and to be honest i i've seen things of                                 of people i know                                 occasionally and and comments and things                                 like that                                 of people who seem to be struggling to                                 find that resilience                                 how how do we do that                                 well there are some things                                 that that can be done and this is kind                                 of                                 my synthesis of some things that i've                                 i've i've read over the years about this                                 subject of resilience                                 for me having gone through some various                                 changes in my life                                 this subject of resilience and carrying                                 on has always                                 has always been of interest so                                 um that's partly why                                 in fact i went through all of the bad                                 news                                 in gory detail to get to this point                                 one thing that                                 it seems is is important in being able                                 to to get                                 through a tough situation is being able                                 to acknowledge it                                 uh and and this um                                 calls to mind something called the                                 stockdale paradox                                 and i'm not                                 really a huge fan of of war stories and                                 war heroes but                                 uh the stockdale paradox is named after                                 uh james stockdale who was                                 a navy pilot for the us who was shot                                 down                                 in the vietnam war and then spent eight                                 years as a prisoner of war                                 and was was tortured pretty brutally                                 but still managed to organize sort of                                 the resistance of the prisoners of war                                 and all of that                                 and he went through what was arguably                                 one of the                                 one of the more grueling one of the more                                 uh horrible                                 experiences of a lot of those people                                 and he got through it and                                 in fact there were other people that                                 were                                 shot down with him in a similar                                 situation who did not                                 and and after the fact he was asked you                                 know                                 if there was anything that he could                                 identify                                 that that would explain why some people                                 made it and some people didn't through                                 this horrible                                 horrible experience and his answer was                                 yeah it was really pretty easy to tell                                 uh the ones who didn't make it were                                 mostly the ones                                 who were unrealistically optimistic                                 uh they would say oh yeah we're gonna be                                 home by christmas                                 uh and then christmas would come                                 and they were still there and then say                                 oh well we'll be home by easter                                 and then easter would come and they                                 would still be there and so it would go                                 and that that eventually broke their                                 spirit                                 so the first thing that you need to do                                 in order to get through a crisis                                 is to understand thoroughly                                 what you're up against and to be aware                                 of you know not to have false optimism i                                 should say to be aware that things are                                 not just going to magically get better                                 uh and and that's the situation we face                                 as well                                 we're not going to be out of this by                                 christmas uh                                 so we need to be aware of that but the                                 flip side of this and that's why they                                 call it the stockdale paradox                                 is that you need to also have                                 the faith the optimism and even                                 even the certainty that you're going to                                 be able to find a way to handle this                                 that you will get                                 through it or uh                                 i think going along with this is this                                 quote from chomsky that i like                                 uh optimism is a strategy for making a                                 better future                                 because unless you believe that the                                 future can be better                                 you're unlikely to step up and take                                 responsibility for making it so                                 so that's that's kind of the thing we                                 we need to acknowledge that we're in a                                 tough situation                                 and it's going to be a while before                                 things materially get better                                 but we need to have that faith that                                 confidence that optimism that things                                 will get better and                                 act to make that happen                                 and that's hard because i think                                 at this point everybody who's listening                                 to me has at some point in the past few                                 months                                 uh felt you know been afraid been                                 exhausted                                 hopeless felt grief for the things that                                 have been lost                                 some combination of those at some point                                 i think we have all                                 we have all felt so we need to we need                                 to think about what it is that can help                                 us get past that and deal with that and                                 act to                                 to go ahead and keep building uh the                                 future outcome                                 and in fact there are i think                                 three things i mean you could you can                                 split it up you can make more you can                                 make fewer whatever this is kind of my                                 categorization                                 of three things that that we can look to                                 uh to help us through this and the good                                 news                                 is that so many of us are already doing                                 these things they're not                                 things that we cannot do                                 and these things then are around                                 sort of three things one of them is a                                 sense of belonging                                 and research on resilience say that if                                 you have social connections this does                                 make you more resilient                                 uh and so here we are in the face of an                                 event that                                 that pulls us apart we need to work                                 perhaps we need to work more                                 intentionally to maintain our social                                 connections                                 but in fact we are uh as                                 as a python community as individuals we                                 are finding ways to maintain those                                 social connections                                 certainly i check in on friends that                                 i've met from various python                                 events uh and see how you know how are                                 you doing are you okay                                 uh more than i would have before but                                 also we've got                                 more events so like here uh this slide                                 this is                                 um a social meeting that                                 pie ladies in el alto bolivia had uh six                                 weeks ago                                 uh we had just uh seen a demonstration                                 from lupe of                                 the moronada a uh a bolivian                                 uh dance uh and and it was just                                 a a chance to connect and to make those                                 social connections                                 uh and you know honestly for me                                 in the before time i wouldn't probably                                 have had the chance to                                 to go to a meeting of pi ladies bolivia                                 but                                 under these conditions i could i                                 encourage                                 everybody we all need to look for those                                 chances and sort of seize upon that                                 and of course meeting meetups and                                 conferences like that online are                                 thriving everywhere that was not                                 like an unusual one-off thing um                                 from everywhere people are moving                                 meetups and conferences                                 online um you know here pike on india um                                 it looks to be a a massive conference                                 online                                 um great evidence that this is working                                 and it is actually um                                 in a way it's liberating our current                                 conditions in that                                 when everybody has to be online then                                 both the organizers and the speakers can                                 go wherever in the world they want                                 uh and and that that i think is is a                                 cool thing as i say i get to                                 uh be at pike on india here today                                 and at um pycon spain tomorrow                                 uh without ever leaving my house                                 actually i'm ready to leave my house but                                 that's a different story uh                                 so and and you know as we do this we're                                 actually sort of probing and                                 experimenting with                                 all of these tools and techniques um                                 so i think in the in the many uh meetup                                 and and conference appearances i've had                                 in the past                                 six months i think i've had a chance to                                 try out                                 nearly every conferencing tool out there                                 we're really sort of working through and                                 doing what we can to make this work                                 and you know in addition and this is                                 something that i have mentioned uh                                 in other contexts as well uh                                 there is a need we all have a need for a                                 sense of purpose uh we all like to be                                 able to                                 make meaningful contributions this is                                 what drives                                 the open source world this is what                                 drives the python community                                 we would not have those things without                                 this desire on all of our parts                                 we want to be able to help out                                 to make a contribution and                                 again people who've looked at the                                 subject of resilience and getting                                 through crises                                 say that this is a key key factor                                 in making it through and                                 we are doing that also as a python                                 community as                                 individuals we have had                                 at least as far as i can tell a                                 an explosion of people offering training                                 of one kind or another online uh                                 there are tons of twitch streams uh i                                 know i did a twitch stream on python                                 fundamentals a while back                                 at the beginning of quarantine there are                                 people doing online workshops                                 there are tons of videos out uh                                 everybody                                 is is trying to to contribute in that                                 way to do what they can                                 uh here my my example here is chuck ting                                 ho's                                 twitch stream uh i i just chose it                                 uh because she's been so busy in doing                                 all of these things she's got python                                 classes she's got data classes                                 uh with her friend laish she's got a                                 video uh                                 an interview show uh there's this this                                 feeling that we can contribute by                                 helping other people learn                                 that i don't recall seeing before                                 and it truly is a a wonderful thing to                                 see                                 and then we also have                                 we also benefit from having i call it a                                 sense of responsibility                                 it's some people call it a sense of                                 obligation                                 some people call it a sense of altruism                                 this feeling that we need to help                                 others in our community                                 this is one of the keys towards groups                                 making it through a crisis is this                                 willingness to put aside differences to                                 help those people who need it most and                                 to leave no one behind                                 and i see this in a lot of ways                                 i see a lot of people who are                                 contributing and trying to do this                                 through things that they can do with                                 code which of course makes sense because                                 code is what we know right                                 uh and they're doing data analysis or                                 teaching people how to do data analysis                                 or they're setting up sites to share                                 data um                                 in fact one of the best sources for data                                 on the virus in brazil                                 is a site that is run by people in the                                 pycon in the python community in brazil                                 and we're also writing applications this                                 one is is one that i like a lot this is                                 autopi.org which is in paraguay                                 and it was created by                                 a member of the python community there                                 on his own                                 uh and it's a way to match up people who                                 need help they need some sort of                                 specific support                                 with people in their area that can give                                 them that support                                 and we're talking about things that are                                 really basic like food                                 diapers medicine eggs milk                                 sugar things like that uh and they use                                 uh the the                                 this app actually lets people connect by                                 way of whatsapp so that they can                                 uh find each other and make the exchange                                 without having a lot of other things                                 there and                                 you can see on the map where the                                 requests are coming from and all of that                                 it's just like                                 a a a very cool idea but the thing is                                 this was somebody stepping in                                 to help the community because                                 that was what he felt he needed to do                                 so all of this that i've been talking                                 about of course                                 is just another way of saying what is it                                 that helps                                 people get through crisis it's                                 community that's that's what i have been                                 describing i have been describing                                 uh the python community communities in                                 general                                 and for this to work what i'm talking                                 about is community in the fullest                                 sense uh the most we can get from                                 connections and contributions from                                 putting aside our difference                                 uh the most we can do in helping those                                 who need it most and in leaving no one                                 behind                                 and this is where i get to                                 the inclusion part you may have seen i'm                                 sort of sneaking around to this                                 um when we think of connections and                                 contributing and all of those things                                 we need to think of everyone's                                 connections and contributions                                 i can tell you social connections are                                 even more important for those who are                                 are marginalized and and the you know                                 the support of being part of a community                                 is is important for everybody                                 uh but i could also tell you that the                                 people who                                 have been sort of who have lived who've                                 dealt with being                                 in marginalized groups whether that's                                 migrants                                 or or by gender or whatever                                 tend to have um insights and strengths                                 and abilities to contribute                                 in a crisis that are useful                                 uh a susan striker who is a researcher                                 in transgender history                                 said not long ago that there is an                                 amazing um                                 wisdom and strength that comes from                                 knowing just how                                 badly the world can crap all over you uh                                 and i think that's true actually uh so                                 you know                                 it is to the benefit of the community to                                 keep that in mind                                 and to make sure that we bring everybody                                 in as we get through this                                 um the same thing um in terms of putting                                 aside differences this                                 this seems obvious to me but obviously                                 it's not not always clear to everybody                                 the more people we can get with the more                                 different experiences to pull together                                 it's the better we're likely to be and                                 you know if we really do want to help                                 those who need it most                                 if that is part of our our spirit of                                 altruism                                 and obligation it is clearly people in                                 marginalized groups who                                 have been and will continue to be hit                                 the hardest                                 um women in my own minorities                                 always lose their jobs first in a crisis                                 uh and it's groups like that that also                                 tend to have the fewest resources to                                 rely on                                 by bringing them into our communities we                                 can help them                                 uh and that is is part of this                                 altruistic responsibility                                 and again this is just kind of to sum it                                 up if we                                 if we believe in leaving no one behind                                 that means leave                                 no one behind so                                 that that brings me to this why why am i                                 saying this and that's because                                 again as i alluded to earlier on i think                                 we will find that there are people who                                 are saying                                 this is a crisis we can worry about                                 inclusion later                                 or they can even use the crisis to make                                 things worse as an excuse                                 for that and that is not the right                                 answer it is not the right answer for                                 anybody it's not the right answer for a                                 community                                 now is in fact a good time to act on the                                 subject of of                                 inclusion and diversity and things like                                 that                                 and and that's why i was i was so happy                                 to see that that here at pike on india                                 uh there is a diversity and inclusion                                 track                                 uh well done and um you know i                                 i expect that uh as you continue                                 doing this you will find uh you know                                 maybe find more aspects to think about                                 and to include in the future                                 but starting out with with the focus on                                 gender as you have it is is fine                                 and as i say um making the decision to                                 have                                 a diversity and inclusion track in                                 in in this year of crisis uh speaks well                                 of you so again well done for that                                 so i know that that                                 it is likely that that people will want                                  to ask                                  oh so what do you recommend we do                                  uh and this is not because i know                                  anything it's just                                  people always ask things like that and                                  i can't i can't really answer that for                                  everybody                                  um every community every person has to                                  in a way                                  answer that for themselves what i will                                  say                                  is that you should do what you can                                  okay and i have                                  i have a few thoughts on that but you                                  know there are other things too                                  so one thing that i hope we continue to                                  do                                  because as i say we have been doing it                                  is                                  we continue to discover ways to use our                                  technology                                  more fully to support our communities in                                  every way                                  you know it's interesting we've been                                  able to do things like have a conference                                  online                                  we've been able to do that for a few                                  years uh                                  and but we've never really had a reason                                  to                                  to try it and to figure it out and get                                  the most that we can                                  now we are now we're trying everything                                  out and i think that's                                  that's great we can we can take what we                                  have learned and use it in some ways to                                  grow our communities                                  uh technology is for us as as                                  a python community technology is our                                  superpower                                  uh and it's important for us to to                                  figure out how to use it                                  to to care for the community to                                  maintain and build our connections                                  we need to do that we                                  certainly should continue to do the                                  things we have done to contribute                                  uh the education stuff                                  it's it's i i it's great that we do that                                  we                                  we need to keep on doing that i think                                  particularly                                  as we go through uh the covid crisis                                  there will be                                  negative impacts on education at all                                  levels                                  if we can do things that help alleviate                                  that in any way                                  i think that is is definitely to the                                  good                                  and if we can manage to share data                                  and i think we've seen in more than one                                  case governments have not been entirely                                  honest with their data                                  uh if we can manage to share data and                                  make sure that people are informed                                  i think that is useful and of course if                                  we can                                  uh create more services more ways to                                  help people connect                                  to the resources that they need and                                  provide even                                  ways for people to communicate those are                                  all things that                                  as a python community a community of                                  python programmers worldwide                                  we can think about doing um                                  and again clearly obviously we can                                  take care of each other and                                  again restating we can we can help those                                  who need it most                                  we can as a as a global community                                  of pythonistas we can put aside our                                  differences                                  and make sure that we take care of                                  everyone                                  and finally let's let's not leave this                                  out                                  uh we can we can lead                                  we have the resources to be informed                                  citizens we can be advocates for                                  community                                  we can be positive examples we know                                  what community is like what it can mean                                  we can help                                  show others that as well so                                  i i want us to not back away                                  from any chance we may have in that                                  regard to lead                                  and where i've been going                                  we can build we can keep building our                                  community we do not have to let this                                  stop us or slow us down as we work to                                  build community we can continue to                                  organize and volunteer                                  we can continue to work to bring people                                  in                                  we can continue to work to figure out                                  how to do things better                                  we can and i'm sure we will do all of                                  those things to make sure that our                                  communities continue to grow                                  so yeah i i know this was                                  was an unusual talk but these times                                  these times will will reshape the world                                  i think that that                                  this is hard to argue about and again                                  we in the global python community we                                  know the value of community                                  we know how to make community it is up                                  to us                                  to step up and shape the world that will                                  come                                  and there's one more thing                                  that i think needs to be said and i've                                  been saying it at the close of every                                  time i've given these talks                                  so please take this in the spirit it's                                  intended                                  wear the damn masks okay                                  i don't want to lose a single one of you                                  so that's what i've got for you thank                                  you very much for having me here in                                  pycon india                                  it's been an honor and a privilege                                  bye bye
