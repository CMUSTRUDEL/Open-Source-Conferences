	                              hello                               and welcome to pycon india                                    hyderabad stage                               welcome to day one of the conference                               which is packed with amazing talks and                               keynotes for all of you and i hope                               everyone's having a great time                               so let the festivities begin we have the                               first talk of the day by jonas newbert                                on python and programmable logic                                controllers a step by step guide                                jonas is a software developer and                                automation engineer from california                                welcome jonas over to you                                uh hello pycon india also hello to my                                cat who just decided to join us the                                on-site audience                                super excited to be um one of the first                                talks after the keynote                                uh i hope i can sort of get anywhere                                close to the                                to the level of the keynote uh the the                                title of my talk is python and plc's                                and obviously with a title like that the                                first thing you have to do is figure out                                what is the plc                                so i'm going to do that before i even                                start the talk or introduce myself                                this is a plc it's a stock photo so you                                can think of a plc as a type of                                computing device we've got                                i don't know smartphones laptops gaming                                consoles                                and then there's plc's it's a class of                                device that can do                                computation if you ever find a computing                                device and you're not quite sure if it's                                a plc or not                                if it has lots of colorful wires coming                                out of it it probably is one                                plc stands for programmable logic                                controller                                and there's actually a piece of trivia                                that i only learned quite recently                                which is that back in the                                           plcs were first invented                                they were called pcs for programmable                                controller                                there wasn't really any other                                programmable controller around so that                                was a fine name                                and of course then in the                                        personal computer became really popular                                everybody called that pc                                and the the people who were doing                                programmable controller stuff were like                                that doesn't work we have to find out                                and like we have to find a new name                                let's stick                                stick a word in the middle maybe like                                programmable i don't know                                logic controller and that's where this                                acronym plc                                was actually coined                                the story does raise a question like if                                these things have been around since the                                                                                 apparently common like where are they we                                can't see them anywhere in the real                                world                                and the answer is that they are hiding                                in industrial settings they are often                                used in factories                                if you walk around a factory floor you                                might see                                electrical panels like this one and                                quite often there would be a plc                                hiding in there like in this example for                                the window tinting machine or                                this circuit board assembly machine                                they're also in the                                built environment if you go to a theme                                park plc's might be controlling                                the rides in many buildings they control                                the elevators the escalators                                and the other common example that gets                                coin that that gets used quite                                frequently is oil platforms where plc's                                control you know the flow of oils and                                things through the pipes and all that                                stuff that's involved in drilling for                                oil                                the operating principle like what's                                going on in plcs is relatively                                simple basically                                you you have sensors that are wired up                                through electrical signals                                to the plc and those electrical signals                                might be something like if you're in an                                 elevator you press the button                                 to signal which flow you want to go to                                 and                                 that generates an electrical signal that                                 travels to the plc and becomes a                                 variable there                                 similarly if you if you stick your arm                                 into the closing door of an elevator you                                 are breaking the light curtain which is                                 another sensor                                 that sends an electrical signal and                                 again this becomes a variable                                 in the plc then remember it's called a                                 programmable logic controller so                                 somebody programmed that plc in the case                                 of the elevator                                 to have logic that says stop closing the                                 door if there is                                 an arm in the way so this logic gets                                 executed some output variables come                                 about they get converted back into                                 electrical signals                                 and they get sent to the actuators so                                 the elevator whatever the motor or the                                 thing that's closing the door                                 might get a signal to say stop or the                                 display that tells you which floor                                 you're currently at that might be                                 controlled by a plc                                 or for example a little ding sound you                                 know when that comes up sometimes when                                 you arrive at the floor just before the                                 door opens                                 that would also be an output from the                                 plc                                 similar example oil platforms the inputs                                 there would be pressure sensors and flow                                 sensors and the outputs would be valves                                 that control the flow of                                 of liquid all right                                 we've taken care of that everybody now                                 knows what a plc is                                 so let's start the actual talk uh first                                 slide as usual the sort of introduction                                 my name is jonas i'm a software engineer                                 automation engineer i work in the                                 biotech industry                                 so what that means is that i write                                 software that controls robots that do                                 science                                 and i'm from germany originally but i                                 now live in oakland california                                 which means that um right now the time                                 is uh                                           so my big challenge for today is just to                                 stay awake to the end of the talk                                 sessions and                                 honestly like right now i'm not quite                                 sure if i will make but                                 i'll try um anyway                                 uh why am i sort of coming halfway                                 around the world                                 to give you a talk about python and plcs                                 uh                                 it's a bit of a long story but the                                 justice i've been giving                                 talks at python conferences about                                 industrial automation topics for the                                 past few years                                 it's something i'm really interested in                                 last year i gave a talk at pycon us                                 and it was very high level an                                 introduction to what are plcs what can                                 you do with them                                 what can you do with with them as a                                 python developer what libraries are                                 available                                 so high-level concepts and something                                 really interesting happened after the                                 talk went up on youtube                                 i suddenly started getting a lot of very                                 different questions that were                                 highly specific like people working with                                 python and plcs who got stuck on a                                 certain step                                 or who weren't quite sure which library                                 to use or how to use it                                 and like                                                             so i started asking some questions and i                                 found out that                                 apparently in india it's somewhat more                                 common for python developers to                                 encounter                                 industrial equipment like plcs and                                 apparently it's especially common in                                 universities that class projects or                                 team projects involve a software                                 engineering component which you might do                                 in python                                 and an equipment component which might                                 be a plc and that's                                 why i got all these questions so i                                 figured well why not go to the place                                 where all these good questions are                                 coming from and give a talk about plcs                                 there                                 and um that that's what i'm doing today                                 so the plan here is to give a                                 a bit of a more hands-on practical                                 example of how to get started                                 to address some of those those questions                                 that i've been receiving                                 so the we've already taken care of the                                 intro part of the talk we know what a                                 plc is                                 part one will be a mini tutorial and                                 what we'll be doing is                                 uh i'll be using this plc that i have                                 here in my in my home setup                                 uh we'll program it to blink this                                 traffic                                 light at the start it's gonna be                                 blinking uh red                                 once one second on one second off and                                 uh after that we'll be using the laptop                                 with python                                 to make the plc change its behavior so                                 that this is more like                                 looking right but instead you know                                 yellow or green and so on                                 the second part of the talk after we're                                 done with the demo um                                 i am calling it the faq section                                 basically i'm trying to address some of                                 those questions that i've been receiving                                 since my previous talk                                 and also some of the of the common                                 stumbling blocks that i encounter                                 when i work on plc projects um                                 the the link where you can follow along                                 with the slides if that's what you want                                 to do is                                 on the screen here also posted that and                                 hop in                                 if you want to contact me of course do                                 so you know on pseudo poppy and all                                 these chat platforms you're using at                                 this conference                                 or if you watch this later on youtube                                 you can ping me on the internet i'm                                 i'm pretty active on twitter or by email                                 other two methods                                 i prefer but let's dive right in part                                 one the mini tutorial                                 the blinking traffic signal                                 we're basically going to go from from x                                  to having the laptop                                 talk python to the plc there will be six                                 steps and the first one is that we just                                 have to figure out                                 what kind of plc are we using                                 and i'm seeing that on the live stream                                 at least mine the slides are lagging a                                 little bit behind so the real slide will                                 come in a second                                 um so the step one figure out what plc                                 you're using mine here                                 if i just look here actually has a model                                 number on it it says p                                                                                                manufacturer called automationdirect                                 the reason this is important is that                                 there are about i would say like                                                                                                 currently buy                                 in the world some are very popular and                                 some are a little bit more                                 niche but each one is slightly different                                 like the naming conventions are                                 different                                 like some numbering thing is different                                 maybe the types of protocols                                 supported and how they are supported                                 might differ so it's pretty important                                 that as a first step                                 uh you figure out what it is you get the                                 documentation for                                 the plc that you're using and maybe some                                 of the training material                                 and just get sort of delay of the land                                 for what what the devices that you're                                 working with                                 one of the things you'll find out is how                                 to connect to it                                 and that's step two we have to establish                                 some kind of connection to the plc                                 now i'm using an ethernet connection                                 today because i purchased a plc                                 that has an ethernet connection some                                 others use uh serial port                                 uh proto protocols you know rs                                       something like this                                 um so you know do whatever is right for                                 your setup obviously                                 in my case i connected an ethernet cable                                 to the plc i connected that to this                                 netgear router here                                 there's another ethernet cable that goes                                 straight to my laptop and then i                                 configured                                 the plc to have an ip address on my                                 local network which is uh                                                                                                 neighboring ip address and i put                                 subnet masks in and all this good stuff                                 and then just before the talk i did a                                 quick check and i just did a ping from                                 my laptop                                 and it worked so that's obviously step                                 step one you have to have connectivity                                 sorry that's step step two uh going to                                 step three now                                 uh we have to program the plc to do                                 something because remember it's a                                 programmable device                                 when it comes from the factory uh                                 there's nothing on it it's                                 like somebody has to tell it what this                                 logic is we're expecting                                 to execute on there um you you'll be                                 using vendor software for that                                 so what that means is it's not like                                 python you don't get to pick                                 your own text editor and in fact so i'm                                 going to switch to this vendor software                                 that i have to use to program this plc                                 just to show you what that looks like                                 but a quick warning here uh when i                                 switch over to that to that other                                 program                                 you'll see a non-python language and i                                 know this is a python conference so this                                 is too much you know cover your eyes for                                 a minute                                 but it's actually a pretty cool thing                                 what we're going to see it's a language                                 called ladder logic                                 it's a graphical programming language                                 it's super common in the world of plcs                                 for programming                                 i'm using it in the example that's                                 coming up and i don't expect you to                                 understand everything that's going on i                                 will                                 in fact i will point out a couple of                                 specific things so let's                                 let's do that i'm just going to switch                                 over to this program and now                                 this little delay that we're having                                 might be a problem so i'm just looking                                 at my screen where i see the stream                                 but in the first row that's going to                                 come up on the screen in a second                                 you'll see that a variable called blink                                 interval millisecond gets used                                 and um you know that's that's a a                                 millisecond value for how fast you want                                 to blink                                 and the code here it does something sort                                 of not very important it um                                 it scales it to an internal value lines                                 two and three are                                 timers that basically you know one timer                                 for how long the light will be on                                 one timer for how long it will be off                                 and then the final line                                 at the bottom here we will see another                                 variable called the blink color                                 and blink color drives which ones of the                                 output signals will be energized so                                 if blink color equals one the the red                                 light will be blinking                                 blink color equals two the yellow light                                 will be blinking and if blink color                                 equals three                                 green light will be blinking so the                                 takeaway here is there are                                 two variables that play blink interval                                 milliseconds and blink color and those                                 are the ones                                 we care about in fact i have already                                 programmed the plc so i'm going to                                 switch this to running                                 and in the in the video you'll you know                                 see my my traffic signal blinking                                 which brings us to step four but first i                                 i should point out um                                 steps one through three might be                                 information gathering in your situation                                 uh what that means is it's usually not                                 the software                                 developer's job to to do those steps                                 you usually end up in a situation where                                 somebody else has already installed a                                 plc                                 in a factory for example they've already                                 put a program on they've already figured                                 these things out                                 i did include them because maybe your                                 situation is different maybe                                 you know your your university you just                                 get that stuff given                                 and in those situations uh you you might                                 actually have to do some of this                                 ladder logic program programming                                 yourself and you have to figure these                                 things out                                 in in most organizations where you're at                                 whether that's                                 university or you're working at a                                 company or your                                 your company is sending you to a                                 customer the brand of plc is already                                 fixed                                 because most companies only work with                                 one vendor of plc                                 so that they don't have to do training                                 for multiple products                                 whichever situation you're in steps one                                 two three you either did them or you've                                 figured out what somebody else did                                 step four is where you're getting                                 involved and what's happening here is                                 that you have to                                 assign the plc program variables to                                 modbus registers                                 now there's a new word on this site it's                                 modbus so let's talk about that real                                 quick                                 modbus is a technique and a protocol                                 that's almost as old as plcs are and                                 it's a way for plcs to share the content                                 of variables in their code                                 with any other device on the network it                                 could be another plc                                 or a server or my laptop which is what                                 we're doing today                                 you can imagine what's happening inside                                 the plc to be that                                 the processor of the plc does two things                                 in fact in modern plcs it's usually                                 actually two different                                 cores that are doing this uh one half of                                 the job is to execute this lateral logic                                 just over and over and over you know go                                 to the top work through the bottom start                                 at the top again                                 and that's one half of what the plc does                                 and that's ultimately what makes this                                 traffic light link right now                                 the other half of it is the the part of                                 the processor that handles all the                                 network traffic like when i send a ping                                 to the plc it responds                                 and another thing it does is that it                                 maintains this long list                                 of registers where it can store values                                 and other                                 devices on the network can access them                                 both read and write                                 and these registers are the modbus                                 registers                                 so the way this is set up is that the                                 ladder logic synchronizes                                 with this table of registers what what                                 the variable values are                                 and any device on the network can then                                 ask                                 questions about their values the                                 terminology in the modbus protocol is                                 that                                 in this case the plc is the slave and my                                 laptop is the master                                 and apparently that was super cool                                 terminology for a computer                                 communication protocol in the                                     honestly to me the                                 the nomenclature of client and server                                 makes more sense the uh                                 the plc is the server because it holds                                 like the truth of what these variables                                 these registers are and clients such as                                 my laptop will later be able to                                 to interact with them of course uh                                 i told you that i want my variables to                                 be in modbus registers i haven't told                                 the plc yet                                 so that's our next job and for that i go                                 back to my programming software                                 this actually has a list actually let's                                 not do that let's first look at how the                                 modbus protocol works and this is also                                 important                                 um so what about all these registers um                                 we've basically got two types of data                                 we've got                                 you know very weird terminology they                                 didn't call it booleans and floating                                 points and such                                 back then the gist is there you can                                 either have one bit values                                 or                                                      we're dealing with numbers we want                                 milliseconds and one two three four                                 for the colors so we're going to use                                    bits and we want read and write so                                 therefore we're going to use a holding                                 register                                 in fact we're using two holding                                 registers because we care about those                                 two variables that i pointed out earlier                                 the first variable that we want to make                                 available by our modbus on the network                                 is the blink color                                 we're going to put this into our first                                 holding register using the table that i                                 screenshotted from wikipedia                                 we find out that the modbus address                                 needs to be                                                       and of course python starts indexing at                                 zero so in python we're going to refer                                 to the same modbus register as zero                                 and uh for the blink interval                                 millisecond the plan is to stick this                                 into the second holding register of the                                 modbus                                 system so the modbus address will be you                                 know                                 in the                                                                   refer to it as one                                 so now we're going to the plc and set                                 this up so the plc actually has this                                 very convenient list of all variables                                 that we use and link color and blink                                 interval millisecond are right at the                                 top                                 in fact you can see the initial values                                 the default values are one for blinking                                 in red and                                                   a second and off the second so that's                                 what it's doing and i'm going in here                                 and use the                                 suggested values from the plc to                                 actually assign it                                 these modbus register addresses so we                                 told the plc now that we we have that                                 we wanted to share the the value of                                 those variables in those modbus                                 registers                                 we actually have to tell like really                                 tell the plc this i'm stopping it                                 reprogramming it i'm telling it hey                                 there's been a change you're supposed to                                 share these variables with the world                                 um it's programming it and when it's                                 done it's going to start blinking again                                 here we go which means we can now                                 finally                                 start accessing these registers these                                 values that we want to tinker with                                 over the network and the way we do this                                 is that we use                                 python for it so we we now need a python                                 implementation of the blockbuster                                 protocol on the laptop so that's the                                 next step                                 you actually to do this have a whole                                 list of options um                                 i this is a review of all the actively                                 maintained                                 modbus implementations i could find on                                 ipi                                 pi modbus is by far the most popular                                 lots of stores and github                                 and downloads and all that good stuff i                                 am actually using the third one on the                                 list pi modbus tcp                                 and the reason is just that it has a                                 much simpler api and has some nice debug                                 output that makes the demo more                                 interesting                                 whatever you do you know here are some                                 criteria that might                                 matter for you uh some of them support                                 ethernet                                 modbus only others support serial port                                 modbus only                                 and such things maybe the license                                 matters so you can pick yours from this                                 list                                 uh interestingly the second one from the                                 bottom is actually an interesting one                                 because it's a modbus implementation in                                 micro python so you can actually                                 use the modbus protocol when programming                                 microcontrollers with python which is                                 sort of like                                 this somewhat new thing that you can do                                 anyway                                 just as we're using pi modbus tcp and                                 once we pip and start that                                 we will do some python to you know                                 interact with it and                                 because i'm doing good on time i'm going                                 to do this as a live demo so                                 pip install time modbus                                 tcp i've already installed it                                 so just telling me this i open the                                 python channel                                 one with autocomplete and from the                                 module                                 that we just from the package that we                                 just installed we get the modbus client                                 we instantiate the client                                 and this is where we have to tell our                                 client here what the ip address of the                                 plc is and that's why i told you earlier                                 in so much detail what the networking is                                 i also said that debug flag and an auto                                 open flag and this is just to make the                                 demo more smooth and interesting this is                                 not essential                                 right dlc is sharing the variable values                                 and the modbus registers i've got a                                 client to talk to the plc and modbus                                 the first thing i'm going to do is to                                 check what's in the first holding                                 register                                 and that should be the value                                           it's blinking rate so                                 let's do that read holding                                 registers and we only want the first one                                 which is zero                                 so you can actually see this is the                                 content of the modbus protocol what it                                 said and what it received                                 and what you basically see here is it's                                 a very simple protocol because there are                                 barely any bytes getting sent back and                                 forth                                 and we asked it for what's in the the                                 first holding register and                                 that comes the value of one that makes                                 sense it's blinking red                                 how about we change that let's write                                 a register let's write the zero as one                                 and let's set it to two instead                                 and it immediately starts blinking in                                 yellow so what happened is that my                                 laptop                                 sent a message to plc to change the                                 value of this register                                 inside the plc the ladder logic                                 immediately picked up                                 the new value of this variable and it                                 sets                                 the electrical signals accordingly to                                 make yellow blink                                 and of course you can do the same with                                 green                                 and then we can go back to red                                 and then we can do the same with the                                 second holding register which remember                                 that's the number of milliseconds that                                 it's on and off                                 and currently at one second to                                      milliseconds i'm going to put it at                                     and i was blinking quite as fast um                                 in fact that's making me a little bit                                 nervous so i'm bumping it up to                                 two seconds and now it's lower                                 all right i i do realize this is not                                 rocket science this is like                                 the hello world of this setup                                 i showed this to you because it gives                                 you these six steps that you can follow                                 like a recipe like some kind of                                 checklist                                 even if you have a different kind of plc                                 or you're using a serial port instead of                                 ethernet or you                                 use a different communication protocol                                 you can use this as a guide                                 how to get started with your plc and                                 start communicating with it from python                                 whenever i give this kind of                                 instructions or talks on this topic                                 the very first question that i get and                                 that's what's launching us into the                                 second part of this talk the faq section                                 the very first question that i get is do                                 i have to do this ladder logic stuff                                 can i just program my plc in python the                                 answer is no                                 and there are two explanations one for                                 people who follow the rules and one for                                 people who don't follow the rules                                 let's do the first one first there's a                                 standard                                 iec                                                                amount of detail what a plc is and what                                 it needs to be able to do                                 that standard has a list of languages                                 that you can use to program plcs and                                 python isn't on it                                 i get it you might say well you know                                 it's an old standard let's                                 break the rules let's program it in                                 python anyway uh                                 there's a reason python is not on there                                 the one defining trait of plcs is that                                 they execute                                 the the logic that's on them in real                                 time                                 now real time often gets misunderstood                                 as meaning very fast                                 and while that is often true it's very                                 fast real time actually means that it's                                 predictable                                 so every time this ladder logic program                                 gets scanned and then scanned again                                 and again and again the execution time                                 of every single                                 instruction in there is almost the same                                 with a very small amount of variance                                 and that's important because when you're                                 in that elevator you stick your arm into                                 the door and you change the signal that                                 comes from the                                 light light curtain you don't want the                                 plc to take a second to respond                                 because it's also getting like some                                 modbus commands on the network and it                                 was busy you know doing multi-threading                                 or whatever                                 you want it to stop immediately and not                                 crush your arm                                 and plc's tend to be used in                                 applications where this                                 predictability and this real-time nature                                 is very important                                 and python is not really a language made                                 for that                                 by default it's certainly not a                                 real-time language maybe you could make                                 it                                 somehow but it's not and that's why                                 python is not a language for programming                                 the plc itself                                 this slide shows um what what my                                 my mental model is for understanding                                 what's meant to be done                                 on the plc and ladder logic and what's                                 meant to be done in python                                 i think of it as two controllers the                                 inner loop is running on the plc                                 it's sort of like milliseconds per                                 iterations maybe faster                                 it handles the interface with the real                                 world of sensors and actuators it's                                 doing the timing critical and safety                                 critical things                                 and you might actually not be able to                                 change the logic because there's so much                                 paperwork and regulations preventing you                                 from doing that                                 just to ensure the safety of whatever                                 list the plc is controlling                                 that you know it's a it's a it's                                 basically part of the machine                                 that's the inner control loop and then                                 there's the outer one                                 and that's the one that might be running                                 on the server or in the cloud or the                                 laptop                                 and that only gets to tweak certain                                 parameters of what's happening                                 inside this logic of the plc such as in                                 our case we got to tweak the color and                                 the blinking interval and nothing else                                 we never changed the structure of the                                 ladder logic that's programmed in the                                 plc                                 and the reason python is a really good                                 choice for this outer control loop                                 is that you can tap into the rest of the                                 python ecosystem you can do you know                                 machine learning use                                 keras and you know pandas and analyze                                 data connect to databases                                 ping apis you know change the color of                                 the blinking based on the weather                                 in your favorite tone or something like                                 that all the                                 python makes this very easy and that's                                 why python is a good fit here                                 i should point out i made one of the                                 arrows on here is not filled it's sort                                 of like just an outline in most                                 situations                                 when you interface to plcs from python                                 code you only ever read                                 you never write when you only read                                 that's really what's meant by these                                 buzzwords                                 like you know there's iot and then                                 there's industrial                                 iot so the industrial internet of things                                 or                                 industry                                                             like these are basically buzzwords that                                 say                                 somebody connects to a plc just reads                                 all the values all the time                                 stores it all in a database and then                                 does analysis on it that's basically                                 what                                 industrial iot is and that's what                                 happens most of the time it's                                 relatively rare i think that you                                 actually change the values of the plc                                 but i figured i'll show you in the demo                                 anyway so that                                 you know you're experts and can pull                                 that trick when it's needed                                 um heading towards the end of the timer                                 so let's speed up second question                                 is modbus the only plc communication                                 protocol                                 it's not not by far there's a wikipedia                                 page that lists all the automation                                 protocols and                                 i mean there's got to be a hundred on                                 that list they they fall into two                                 buckets                                 and the first category are the ones are                                 protocols that you can run on                                 standard ethernet networking hardware                                 like the one that you plug your laptop                                 in to get on the internet                                 and then there's the other group of                                 protocols that require specialized                                 hardware                                 for the first category most of those                                 protocols you find a python                                 implementation you just take the name of                                 the protocol you put it into that pipi                                 search box                                 and you find one or more implementations                                 of it                                 and if you check on some of my previous                                 talks if you want to look them up on the                                 internet i sometimes have a review slide                                 in there                                 that gives you an overview of what these                                 protocols are and what python                                 implementations exist                                 another question help my python script                                 won't connect to the plc                                 i do realize it's not a question but it                                 happens a lot so i wanted to include it                                 here many problems you encounter when                                 working with plcs aren't actually plc                                 problems they are networking problems                                 so one thing that's pretty important is                                 that you make sure you know the basics                                 of your networking situation know all                                 the                                 ip addresses involved or the port                                 numbers for the protocols you're working                                 with                                 understand how the subnet masks work uh                                 know what firewalls are installed                                 and also keep in mind many plc's are not                                 connected to the network at all                                 they're kept off the internet and even                                 of the like the office network                                 to protect them from hackers and it                                 might look like they're connected you                                 might be plugged into the same switch                                 but the switch might be configured to                                 not pass traffic                                 from your laptop to the plc these are                                 all things i've run into before so make                                 sure you                                 you understand the networking situation                                 before you try sending                                 commands over the network                                 another question is the the raspberry pi                                 question                                 um why can't we program the bike have                                 you do this with the raspberry pi                                 raspberry pi can do uh blinking of                                 lights and the answer is um                                 out of the box devices like the                                 raspberry pi just don't meet the                                 requirements that plcs are designed for                                 they don't have the real-time code                                 execution they might not survive and the                                 type of temperatures or humidities that                                 plcs are installed in                                 or in factories you often deal with                                 electromagnetic interference                                 um you can modify raspberry pi's to                                 meet those criteria but then it looks                                 like a plc and it also costs as much                                 money um                                 so if you have those requirements that                                 that                                 warrant using a plc you have to use if                                 you don't you don't                                 second to last question can i simulate a                                 plc because you might be interested in                                 working on this stuff                                 sorry to interrupt you but uh you have                                 just a minute to go so if you can                                 quickly wrap up that'll be great yeah                                 that's the plan i've got you know a                                 minute and                                                            i'm going to be done in that time so                                 yeah can i simulate qrt you might you                                 might want to do that because buying a                                 plc is expensive it's industrial gear                                 you might not even be able to purchase                                 it at all because they only sell                                 to companies so i prepared this slide                                 here for you i'm not going to go through                                 it                                 you can screenshot it those are a couple                                 of options you have for                                 trying out ladder logic and some of                                 those other things without actually                                 having a physical plc                                 for yourself and at the bottom i have a                                 link to a reddit thread where lots of                                 people collect really good material for                                 getting started                                 with plc programming and finally this is                                 a message i get a lot can you help me                                 with my plc                                 question two answers to that the first                                 one is i'm not a plc expert                                 i've worked with a few plc's on a few                                 simple projects but                                 in most cases i actually can cannot help                                 you                                 but if you email me or anybody else or                                 you try to ask on the forum or ask                                 google                                 make sure to include the relevant                                 information that makes the other person                                 able to answer your question what brand                                 of plc are you using what pro                                 what program you used to program the plc                                 what communication protocol                                 maybe include a python script to                                 illustrate what it is you're trying to                                 do even if it doesn't work                                 and if you can if it's not in the                                 confidential setup like at work                                 maybe take a photo or do a sketch of                                 what it is you're doing that will really                                 help the other person understand what                                 you're trying to do and                                 maybe it will be able to answer your                                 question and with that i want my last                                 slide right at the end of my time                                 um i'm going to be available on uh you                                 know student                                 and hop in to answer your questions or                                 if you watch this later                                 you can find me on twitter with my                                 contact details on this slide
