                          developer advocate for microsoft                                i'm actually a java developer but i also                                do

let's get started                                and being um having dwarfism i've always                                had to bolt on                                my um my world and these are my car                                pedals on my midlife process my                                    uh bmw and that's really the story that                                i want to                                tell you today is that accessibility has                                also been                                handled as a bolt-on being able to kind                                of look at it                                um after the effect and and and i'll                                make a plan here's me                                at lecturing at a in a university and                                and trying to                                reach the screen and yes me trying to                                get some coffee um you can see that                                i really like coffee not as much as                                whiskey but i like coffee                                and um we we've also seen this happen a                                little bit in                                in the software industry and uh people                                have been tired of doing bolt-on so the                                first kind of real                                change that i've noticed uh um when it                                when it came to accessibility was them                                the the inclusion of agile into software                                development because anti also                                uh promised to change a lot um you can                                see here he has the manifesto for agile                                software development                                and it says we're uncovering better ways                                of developing software by doing it and                                helping others to do it                                through this work we have come to value                                individuals and interactions over                                processes and tools                                working software over uh comprehensive                                cabinet club                                documentation customer collaboration                                over contract negotiation                                responding to changeover following a                                plan that is while there is value on the                                items on the                                right we value on the items on the left                                a little bit more and the agile                                manifesto really came                                came about because people wanted change                                but the problem was                                that what we saw is that the change                                didn't happen exactly like we wanted he                                has a                                an agile open office where someone put a                                a fish tank in it                                and can you imagine having to clean that                                in an um                                in an office environment with the fish                                like you know suddenly like you know                                decided to be more agile and jump out                                we've also noticed with with agile with                                software                                that we we have white boards everywhere                                and these these magnificent                                white boards that now you have to learn                                 how to clean use the right cleaning                                 material                                 we also learned how to post sticky notes                                 i've been on two courses two courses                                 on how to post sticky notes and you hold                                 the note in your hand you take your                                 finger                                 and you slowly kind of uh push the notes                                 off                                 and and take it off to not disturb the                                 glue but what what what is going on why                                 did i have to learn                                 about um sticky notes when all i really                                 wanted to do                                 is it creates agile and and                                 accessibility                                 but the the truth is that we all suffer                                 from this the same hydra                                 the same kind of bugs that came about if                                 you don't know the hydra it's it's a                                 greek mythology                                 whereas if you chop the the one head off                                 of the                                 the monster another head kind of grows                                 up and this is the same with                                 accessibility                                 that as soon as you chop one bag off an                                 accessible bug                                 and you program towards it another one                                 actually comes about and                                 and the promise of agile may have not                                 uh really uh happened and this is the                                 what ma the cracks of the talk is                                 instead of                                 bolting on the uh the software to make                                 it do                                 how do you start and actually get your                                 software being accessible                                 from the the start once you have                                 accessible                                 uh software once you have your agile                                 process then you can also look at                                 how do you start with aligned autonomy                                 if you don't know a land-a-thon                                 autonomy it takes alignment autonomy and                                 it gives people                                 three different purposes autonomy                                 mastery                                 and purpose now with autonomy mastery                                 and purpose                                 it gives people the need to actually                                 create                                 accessible software it's also part of                                 ikigai                                 ikigai is the pursuit of what you love                                 what the world needs what                                 you can be paid for and what you're good                                 at now accessibility you might be asking                                 what has this got to do with                                 accessibility worry because if you look                                 at um                                 accessibility and you say hey who wants                                 to make accessibility uh software                                 uh put your hands up the only people who                                 put their hands up for preachers bank                                 robbers roller coasters cops and                                 djs because unfortunately                                 agile's not the only uh problem that we                                 we have to do that we also live in an                                 empathy bubble                                 now you've never been a dwarf like me                                 you've never had dwarfism so                                 you can't really uh understand what it's                                 like to                                 to have to create software for me                                 because you're just                                 not living in my shoes and that's called                                 an empathy bubble so how do you get                                 around that                                 and we we're gonna take look at um                                 agile we're gonna look at how to uh                                 incorporate agile and also how to                                 use agile methodologies to cater for um                                 and remove that empathy bubble because                                 if you don't remove that empty thick                                 bubble                                 when you try to chop the hard dress head                                 off you're going to fail                                 and you're going to create a                                 inaccessible software that                                 we don't uh want people to actually you                                 can see here he has an                                 example on accessibility fail where they                                 try to create a wheelchair ramp                                 and obviously they they didn't actually                                 manage so i've got a plan i've got a                                 plan for you today                                 we're going to define accessibility                                 we're going to understand your                                 organization's unique accessibility                                 motivators then we're going to set                                 achievable interim milestones                                 and finally we're going to implement uh                                 tools                                 and once we implement the tools we're                                 going to measure and improve and                                 automate with those tools i'm going to                                 show you some devops tool chains                                 i'm going to show you the immersive                                 reader some very nice demos that we're                                 going to go through so let's define                                 accessibility                                 accessibility is the design product                                 services environment so that everyone                                 including people with disabilities can                                 follow                                 experience and now that's not designing                                 for                                 um accessibility that's designing for                                 for everyone                                 and we believe at microsoft that once                                 you do that you do inclusive product and                                 service design you                                 you you actually innovate and i'm going                                 to show you the process on how it                                 creates                                 innovation when you program with um                                 everyone in mind in truth also we need                                 to define                                 disability now disability is not a                                 personal health condition when you go to                                 the doctor you simon feeling too good uh                                 too good he doesn't say                                 hey yeah i know i think you have the                                 disability                                 the only time that you have disability                                 is if you have a mismatch                                 human interaction now i bought a bmi                                 scale um                                 i've lost                                                              my midlife process i've also got healthy                                 and i jumped on the bmr scale before i                                 lost that weight and i put in my details                                 four foot one and i weighed                                             the time                                 and i put in all the details and i                                 clicked uh you know                                 and measure me and it it called me                                 horrible names and i felt disabled at                                 the time because it had                                 mismatched human interaction so that's                                 that's accessibility and what disability                                 also there's principles with                                 accessibility the first                                 principle and these are based on the tag                                 the web center for accessibility                                 guidelines is perceivable can you                                 see it so if you have visual impairments                                 like i do with my my                                 new fancy glasses that i have here um                                 can you see it                                 operable can you use it so motor motor                                 impairments understandable can you                                 understand it                                 and we've also seen the inclusion of                                 adhd and autism spectrum                                 in also accessibility preparations and                                 finally robust if you're going to create                                 accessible software                                 it can't break when you have future                                 technologies especially since                                 most people who use accessibility                                 software don't actually use it on                                 portrait mode they use it on                                 landscape uh mode now that we've got our                                 definitions look at it                                 let's look at our motivators first                                 stick and carrot so stick is that you're                                 gonna                                 tell a dog to do something you can                                 either use a stick and pound them or you                                 can use                                 a carrot or a piece of meat and you can                                 tell them what to do so                                 the first is the stick the legislation                                 so the                                                      experience act from the american federal                                 government and then the eu parliament                                 directory on digital accessibility that                                 says                                 that uh by next year if you don't have                                 accessible software and you're publicly                                 facing a civil site                                 mean government or a civil society then                                 you can get up to like the what the                                 canadians have done a hundred thousand                                 dollars per day fine yes                                 stick but i like to think about the                                 character rather and it's best summed up                                 by the quality of life                                 quotes by bill gates one of our founding                                 chairmans                                 for most of human history we put our                                 innovative capacity in                                 into improving the quantity of life more                                 more more more                                 because we're living longer our focus is                                 starting to shift towards improving the                                 quality of life                                 making an altruistic approach to make                                 things                                 better and once you have that the                                 quality of life then you can also start                                 to look at the awareness of others                                 difficulties and start instead of pity                                 go to sympathy empathy and compassion                                 remember what i said to you about that                                 empathy bubble                                 and you create and you pop that bubble                                 by                                 looking at your customers and your                                 people that use your software                                 so here is something called uh empathy                                 personas                                 and in these empathy personas you have                                 claudia ashley and ron run as a                                                                                                         arthritis                                 losing his hearing failing our sites you                                 take these personas                                 if you create persona labs and you you                                 look at your software                                 and you try to actually get out of that                                 empathy bubble                                 by applying them you can go to that url                                 that you see there                                 and download these these software um                                 these personas so once you have your                                 personas                                 then you look at the inclusive design                                 steps first of all we recognize                                 exclusion you create your persona                                 spectrums                                 and then you superimpose them on your                                 software you so for one extend to                                 meaning                                 with the persona spectrums and finally                                 learn from diversity and adjust your                                 software                                 platforms to cater for that so we've got                                 our persona spectrums over here i've got                                 an amputee                                 who has one on um who has lost an arm                                 from a uh from an accident when you have                                 an arm injury someone in a motorbike                                 accident who's got a temporary                                 disability and then a new parent because                                 we know all new parents financially                                 mentally                                 physically or all kind of uh you know um                                 uh have                                 accessibility issues so you've got                                 you've got these percent inspections now                                 if you go to your manager and you say i                                 want to cater for someone with an                                 amputee and he's going to say but                                 there's only                                                            this is the u.s center for                                 uh disability statistics but if you look                                 at the temp                                 company um numbers there's                                            and if you have the situation                                 there's                                                               you cater for one persona spectrum                                 you're actually going to cater for                                    million individuals now                                 when we look at the broad people who are                                 have accessibility requirements                                 there are over three billion people                                 there's one billion people with                                 accessibility                                 uh requirements and there's an                                 additional two billion people who are                                 heavily invested friends family loved                                 ones                                 who really want to see this their that                                 software                                 um be uh used by the by the by their                                 loved ones                                 that means that if you don't cater for                                 accessibility software you're really                                 negating                                 nearly a half of the world's population                                 once you've got your persona spectrums                                 then you superimpose them                                 over at your software journey so the                                 software journey that we have here                                 you've got a ticketing scenario                                 registration

         ai                                 adjustment and i did a talk on sarcasm                                 as a service you can go look at it on my                                 youtube video and i showed how                                 we're creating ai that has become more                                 sensitive to individuals because if you                                 start screening                                 at an ar saying help help help and the                                 ar doesn't respond in a sensitive manner                                 it can't actually be um you know part of                                 your process                                 once the ai also understands that then                                 adjust your flow let the ai go and                                 adjust                                 the flow and um really change it for                                 their person's                                 personal accessibility requirements                                 let's look at the next section which is                                 milestones                                 so normally you've got your milestone                                 which is accessibility right at the end                                 remember the bolts on with me and my                                 coffee and                                 jumping on there and mama                                             accessibility rather                                 you've got the triple projects and you                                 send it through but we've seen                                 a new move to shift left and shift this                                 really                                 says uh instead of a large investment at                                 the end do a small investment throughout                                 the process                                 test encoding design and backlog and you                                 you now actually                                 start to see that we're we're adopting                                 agile we're adopting an agile                                 accessibility process we've looked at                                 how to                                 burst that empathy bubble and now we're                                 doing it through an agile process                                 we we do that also and through that                                 process with our tooling                                 the first tool i want to introduce to                                 you is x-core                                 now we've partnered with dq labs and a                                 lot of our accessibility software                                 uses the x engine and we've open sourced                                 our software which i'm going to demo to                                 you also and the x engine is a                                 javascript library you can run it from                                 any other language also i'm going to                                 show you how to run it in python um it's                                 an npm package                                 it scans a rendered dom so whether you                                 have a a                                 web application or a a windows app or                                 even an android app it will scan your                                 application                                 reports uh back results at json and the                                 same                                 engine as accessibility insights inside                                 your your code                                 and i know what you you're thinking wait                                 why can't i use this for devops yes you                                 can i'm going to show you how to                                 actually use this                                 in a devops entrance you've got your                                 developer in your devops uh                                 pipeline you do your yawn test as part                                 of your                                 uh release pipeline then it tests your                                 your page it might be a typescript in                                 html                                 and then it actually runs in selenium                                 or um cypress etc and                                 and then prints back the results in your                                 html                                 uh areas and you can see here he has a                                 running in uh                                 x pipelines you can go and play around                                 with it github.com forward slash                                 microsoft forward slash x                                 pipeline samples you get your results                                 back there                                 you you push them through to the testing                                 team on your development team                                 but that's if you want to do testing                                 um at the beginning of the development                                 but what happens if you can't if you                                 can't actually test                                 and you've got an existing site not                                 introducing the immersive reader now                                 this                                 uses our cognitive services in the                                 background to take your site                                 and to convert it for you without you                                 really having to do                                 much effort into a accessible software                                 that is work                                                                                                      scans your page                                 and uses cognitive services to create a                                 rendered version of that page that is                                 accessible                                 now you're using it already because                                 you're using it in microsoft teams and                                 microsoft office and microsoft excel                                 it already is there so you just click on                                 immersive reader                                 and it gives you the ability to uh to                                 create                                 an immersive experience from your your                                 uh un accessible software so what can it                                 do                                 it has multiple language in the czech it                                 has hindi it has                                 arabic it has uh english it has all of                                 these different languages and it can                                 give you the ability to also to be                                 multilingual it has translation                                 up to                                                                   pronunciation                                 and it reads back that so it can                                 actually do reading back in a language                                 and also a voice of your choice syllable                                 breakdown and then finally also pictures                                 so you can get and this is being used                                 heavily in our learning environment for                                 our schools also                                 because kids also want that                                 experience so enough talk enough slides                                 let's do some demos here                                 so let's get out of here um and i'm                                 going to                                 minimize that if i do um make mistakes                                 on my macintosh if this is only the                                 third month that i've got a macintosh                                 and i'm still learning so the first demo                                 i want to show you is a page here with                                 accessible and inaccessible                                 so uh the accessible version here and                                 this is                                 w                                                        homepage you can see here that this is                                 the accessible version                                 and it's got alt tags and it's got the                                 right                                 font and everything but the inaccessible                                 version looks exactly the same                                 because all they've done there is that                                 they've done terrible html here so if i                                 go                                 look at the uh the list artemia go                                 inspect you'll see there that                                 with the inspect they've used br tags                                 rather than list                                 uh list tags which is terrible which                                 means that a screen reader would never                                 be able to                                 uh read that and also on the alt text if                                 i mouse over there                                 it doesn't tell me what i'm looking at                                 so a screen reader can't software i                                 can't see it now i'm going to use                                 this little icon here and that's free to                                 use the accessibility insights for web                                 and that uses the x engine i can click                                 on that now it's got all of                                 these other options here automated                                 checks you can go all the way through to                                 if you want to do uh assessment it gives                                 you a very detailed assessment that you

                there you can click on                                 tab stops and you can see how that page                                 there                                 is accessible and i can go through that                                 so this is accessible insights for edge                                 and chrome and now let's put this into                                 devops and let's put this into                                 a python got plenty time still with my                                 demo                                 um and the first thing i want to show                                 you is                                 no not that one i want uh not the floss                                 dem i want to show you how to run this                                 with uh there we go                                 yes uh in your devops tool trends i've                                 got a page here                                 that i created in uh of html                                 and if i if i look at this page here so                                 let's go uh                                 validate open i want to open this                                 with uh open integrate terminal open                                 that                                 there we go no i don't want to do that                                 i want to just open this in finder uh                                 okay well you can kind of see                                 so it's got an html page this uh text                                 box                                 has no accessible label and it's                                 violating um you know a rule because you                                 need a label                                 this one the color contrast is too low                                 and this text has an invalid role                                 attribute                                 so role attributes are used to actually                                 tell screen readers what to do so this                                 isn't                                 a bad html site and i've got this page                                 there and i want to run this now                                 in my my uh python uh                                 fixtures here so you can see there i've                                 got my start my chrome driver                                 and then i've got my test at sample page                                 here this is all available in the links                                 that i've sent you                                 and i'm going to run this against there                                 and it's going to bring back in my                                 devops tool chain                                 the errors that that page actually had                                 so i'm gonna run it there                                 and uh i'm gonna run all my scripts                                 there and i actually want to                                 run it once and then i'm gonna debug it                                 and i'm gonna show you what what                                 happened so it ran                                 and it failed but now i wanna check                                 exactly why did it fail                                 and it stopped there and i can go look                                 at my data you can see the violations                                 there exactly what i thought                                 would happen so let's go back into data                                 and we want to go violations you can see                                 they're all ensure                                 elements um have a a valid uh                                 role attribute and it gives you all of                                 that details                                 and that in json then you can actually                                 go there now and                                 send that back to the developer and this                                 is available in the                                 um the accessibility axillinium                                 um toolchain that i sent you and so                                 so that's in devops but what about                                 immersive reader rory so we've looked at                                 how to test it on the front end with                                 your testing team                                 how to do it in devops and the second                                 one is uh the last one sorry                                 is how to do this with the immersive                                 reader so now i've set up immersive                                 reader beforehand                                 um and i've used the tutorial here so                                 stop the immersive reader using the path                                 and sample project                                 you can access that in azure cognitive                                 services and i created my immersive                                 reader beforehand                                 um and and it's it's pretty soon and                                 it's free for the first                                 million times you use it um and                                 then ten dollars afterwards though so                                 it's pretty                                 pretty great so i've got this immersive                                 reader running there                                 and i've tied into it and i've                                 integrated it with uh my project let me                                 just close this                                 quick visual studio insiders go to my                                 project there                                 and not that project there we go                                 and i've got my app.pi and my after                                 firing just gets gets my secrets                                 to speak to my um                                 my immersive reader cognitive services                                 uh pops my uh                                 my message and and then j                                       results i've got my index.html there and                                 the index.html                                 has uh some text there the immersive                                 reader is a tool that implements proven                                 techniques to improve reading                                 comprehension                                 um and then it just calls a javascript                                 uh to get the token                                 and then handle the immersive reader and                                 then pops up the immersive reader and                                 this is everything you can get online                                 via that uh tutorial now um to run this                                 and this was a little bit difficult not                                 knowing mac and everything like that i                                 had to run                                 flask run at the install flaws for free                                 that will run                                 oh okay of course it's not gonna run                                 let's go to bash                                 bash ask                                 run hey                                 and it's running on uh port                                      and i'm going to click through here come                                 on click and                                 let's move that into that just went into                                 the wrong                                 screen minimize that                                 and we want this the immersive reader                                 path and quick start yes                                 but we want you to come into this screen                                 there we go                                 no that is and that is already in this                                 right screen                                 move to built-in written there okay so                                 now it's got the text that we created                                 about immersive read remember and most                                 readers are too that implements movement                                 technologies                                 and this isn't uh maybe not fully                                 accessible and it's got some languages                                 there also                                 it's got chinese and arabic now to click                                 on that that's just the button that i                                 that i selected

it creates an immersive experience                                 hopefully the lord demos actually                                 works out it can connect to my cognitive                                 services and i've got an immersive                                 reader                                 and um i don't know if you can hear this                                 though but immersive reader                                 is a tool that's implemented technology                                 so it actually is reading it out to me                                 and i can go in and change the the font                                 size                                 to do the text preferences the grammar                                 options                                 the reading preferences also i can click                                 on line focus                                 choose a language so let's do this in                                 hindi uh there we go by document                                 and it'll go and translate uh hopefully                                 that'll work                                 um there we go
