some time so we are going                               to begin hey everyone this is going to                                be a real quick                                talk i'm going to introduce guys                                introduce you guys to a package called                                chassis                                that i developed during my free time i                                guess so                                yeah let's begin so it was a lazy                                weekend and i was                                sitting on my desk almost exactly like                                this guy right there and you know                                waiting for my script to run it was                                taking too long so i                                decided to hop onto the shower and you                                know let that script run                                and as it happens when you shower your                                mind goes to places                                and you have weird thoughts like if you                                should submit a lightning talk about                                lightnings or maybe if you should have a                                thunder talk after lightnings                                uh you know the point is brain is weird                                so                                i thought maybe my script could you know                                signal me a status uh                                with music uh if maybe it's running or                                if it's completed or maybe if it errors                                out                                you know it could you know play some                                music to indicate that that happened                                so kind of like background scores post                                scripts and i was like you know                                this is the weekend plan for me and i'm                                going to do it now                                i did build it but that was two weeks                                later so                                open source can uh but how to do this uh                                with                                python scripts it was you know quite                                straightforward you know i just                                start a demon thread or a process in the                                background                                uh that place music and you know                                alter its state when needed uh which                                means kill it when the job is done you                                know pause it and                                there's humid like i                                implemented this in python using                                decorators because                                uh you know that bad boy can fit so many                                functions                                uh so here's the code uh so you just do                                pep install chassis to install it in                                your system                                and then you just have you just import                                painting track and then you can use that                                as a decorator in                                your function and then pass it an mp                                 file uh which                                uh so when there's been this script runs                                it's gonna play this file in the                                background                                there are also other decorators like                                when your script fails                                or when your script succeeds it can play                                you know any kind of music                                for example on error track here it plays                                of your enthusiasm                                and on success it plays you know the                                anime wow soundtrack                                as the project you know went out issues                                were opened and some wounds were open                                too                                and i mean some blatantly stupid things                                i didn't care about because it worked in                                my                                in my laptop so but uh the thing is                                uh playing music using python or any                                other package is kind of dependent on                                your                                operating system it depends whether                                you're on unix or if you're on windows                                like                                uh the that the methods and that like                                the                                the library is used very greatly so                                i thought i could you know avoid all of                                that and maybe implement                                it with jupiter and maybe uh be                                os agnostic at the same time so if you                                don't know about how                                 jupiter plays music it just uses html                                 audio tags to do this uh and you know                                 you don't have to                                 wrap your function you trap your code in                                 a function because you have jupyter                                 magic                                 that you can just attach to your cell                                 and you know have it do anything you                                 want                                 so this is how a normal uh                                 a jupiter audio tag looks like you just                                 import audio and then                                 you play a track and then the audio                                 element shows up where you can you know                                 control your audio like pause                                 play increase music you can download it                                 and stuff like that                                 so now i need to make the audio tag                                 invisible to the users because                                 i don't want that ugly audio tag to be                                 visible and also i                                 wanted to i want to control it even                                 though it's invisible                                 and i want to do it all you know                                 programmatically so                                 to do that i kind of write my own                                 version of                                 ipython audio which is like overloading                                 on top of the existing audio                                 so i just change the html element which                                 renders on your                                 uh on your on your notebook so what i do                                 is i just replace the                                 display as none so you don't get                                 anything and also i add a                                 control variable called loop so that i                                 can also set a                                 parameter if i want to you know keep                                 blue looping my music                                 over and over again so now that we are                                 we have a custom audio tag i implemented                                 a very basic player                                 which can play and pass music so to play                                 music i just                                 initialize uh the class i created an                                 object and i'm just returning it out                                 with a display id uh it can be a uuid                                 for here i'm just giving it one two                                 three just for the sake of it and also                                 there is                                 a stop music method which is not exactly                                 a method is kind of a                                 destructor because it just                                 updates the display to an empty string                                 so that you know                                 the music stops playing so now uh once                                 this is done you can instantiate the                                 player                                 to start the music and stop the music                                 and it's all                                 non-blocking and you know habits in the                                 background uh                                 so like this is                                 a quick enter in a quick thing i i want                                 to show my repository where                                 all of this is written so there's also                                 collab notebook you can open it out                                 so with jupyter notebooks you can just                                 have                                 these audio tag these magic elements you                                 can attach and you just                                 load the magic and then you just add it                                 to yourself                                 and then when you run it it's going to                                 play the track                                 i don't want to play it right now                                 because uh i tried it once and it was                                 really loud so i don't want to                                 you know affect anyone's hearing so i'm                                 like                                 i'm just going to link you to this                                 repository which is                                 github.com and you can you know                                 open the notebook and you know give it a                                 try and you know maybe you find it                                 useful or maybe you find it fun                                 yeah i just wanted to tell you guys                                 about it thank you very much
