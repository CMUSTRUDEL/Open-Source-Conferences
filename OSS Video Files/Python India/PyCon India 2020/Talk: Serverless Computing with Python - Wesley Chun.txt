a little bit more about me uh                                 my background is that my you know my                                 goal is to enable all current and future                                 developers everywhere you know around                                 the world                                 including india to be successful using                                 google cloud and other google developer                                 tools and apis                                 uh before i joined the cloud platform                                 team i used to be on the g suite team                                 so a lot of the videos that you see of                                 me online are going to be                                 of g suite content which is you know                                 gmail google drive calendar doc sheets                                 and slides                                 uh you know of course instead of showing                                 you how to use those apps                                 i'm telling you how to code them so                                 that's really what those videos are but                                 my background is mostly being a software                                 engineer                                 um i was one of the original engineers                                 that built yahoo of yahoo mail many                                 years ago                                 and uh you know i've written some python                                 books mostly but i have believe it and i                                 have a teaching background as well too                                 so                                 in addition to being an engineer i have                                 a parallel career being a teacher                                 also i'm part of the python community                                 and then that's my academic background                                 okay so let's see what the agenda is                                 today                                 so i'm going to give you a very fast                                 sort of like review                                 overview review of cloud computing just                                 so that everybody's on the same page                                 uh and so that is vendor vendor                                 independent so it applies to                                 microsoft azure it applies to aws as                                 well as google cloud so it's not                                 it's not gender related so it's just a                                 very generic high level overview                                 then i'll talk a little bit more                                 specifically about google cloud and                                 what are the groups of products that we                                 have there and then of course the main                                 topic of the talk                                 is serverless computing and where to run                                 your code                                 and then after the main talk i will give                                 you some examples of inspirational apps                                 that are running on serverless                                 just to kind of give you an idea of the                                 things that you can build and then we'll                                 leave you with a lot of links that you                                 can chase down you will also have a copy                                 of the slides i have a link to the pdf                                 and the pdf has the links that are                                 clickable so you know if you can't see                                 the url but you can tell it's a link                                 uh don't worry you should be able to                                 click it uh in the pdf when you get it                                 okay so how about reviewing cloud                                 computing so what is cloud computing                                 well you know the easiest way i like to                                 say it is that a company doesn't want to                                 support something so they're going to                                 outsource it okay so for example it                                 could be computing                                 could be storage uh it could be                                 applications and one of the most famous                                 applications that we                                 outsource that i worked on is email                                 right                                 so many years ago in order to do email                                 you had to have                                 an email server on your desk on your                                 workstation                                 uh and you had to monitor it but as the                                 internet became                                 you know more you know more widely used                                 you can't really expect people to do                                 that                                 you know my grandmother you know i'm not                                 going to ask her to maintain                                 smtp on                                                           unreasonable                                 right so we've chosen instead of                                 running the mail servers ourselves to                                 outsource that service to a company                                 like you know google for gmail or yahoo                                 for yahoo mail or                                 microsoft for outlook.com or hotmail                                 right so we're outsourcing we the                                 responsibility for sending and receiving                                 mail is no longer our responsibility                                 because now we are paying                                 a cloud vendor to do it for us all right                                 so that's what cloud computing is and                                 it's all of those                                 not just one of them so more                                 particularly as far as                                 you know email goes it's one of it falls                                 into one of the cloud pillars so these                                 are like the well-known three service                                 levels                                 you have software as a service uh                                 infrastructure as a service and platform                                 as a service                                 so the email example i brought up is an                                 example of a software as a service                                 that's email right so that's gmail                                 yahoo mail hotmail in fact all of uh g                                 suite or google apps which is you know                                 gmail google drive calendar                                 sheet slides salesforce office                                         of those are examples of sas                                 apps they are basically cloud-based                                 applications that you do not install on                                 your computer                                 but instead you access them and you log                                 into them via a web browser                                 it is a application that's in the cloud                                 now so i've outsourced the application                                 so that's sas                                 at the very bottom is where i'm                                 outsourcing hardware that's where i need                                 virtual machines and big storage                                 so compute engine ec                                                   all of those count                                 most cloud vendors have an                                 infrastructure service so this is at the                                 basic you know the most                                 raw hardware that you're trying to                                 outsource because you don't want to buy                                 it                                 because it gets obsolete and things like                                 that in fact when you buy a laptop as                                 soon as it arrives at your door                                 uh it's already obsolete right uh that's                                 just how it works                                 now it's great that uh cloud vendors                                 have this service                                 but if you're trying to get a vm and                                 your purpose is to run an application                                 well guess what it's not as easy as that                                 because you also have to                                 decide what's the operating system i                                 have to do you know windows server                                 or linux if so which distribution if and                                 then which kernel version                                 so that decision has to be made then you                                 have to decide on web server                                 database server you know and all these                                 different things that you're responsible                                 for in addition to the application code                                 so it's really a lot of work so the best                                 spot is sort of like the sweet spot is                                 in the middle with platform as a service                                 this is where you don't have to worry                                 about the hardware you just rent the                                 applications and you upload it to you                                 know                                 google or heroku or aws lambda and then                                 the cloud vendors run it for you                                 you don't have to worry about the                                 hardware you don't care what operating                                 system it is                                 okay and one of the things i also want                                 you to know is that if you're writing an                                 application on                                 a platform as a service system just                                 think about it this way you are actually                                 writing an application                                 that is a sas app for your users                                 okay let me take tickets from a                                 different angle                                 you know like if you find a bug in gmail                                 you can't go and fix it because it's not                                 your code                                 you have to file a ticket or a bug with                                 google and it's up to our engineers to                                 fix it                                 so as users we don't have control over                                 the code for a sas app                                 so similarly for you if you are writing                                 a an application and you run it on a                                 pass system                                 you have created a sas app for your                                 customers                                 and so your customers can't fix the bug                                 they have to file a ticket with you                                 and you have to fix the bug right                                 because it's your code                                 okay so there's a there's a relationship                                 between paths and sas and of course                                 there's also relationship between these                                 two as well                                 now with any large ecosystem there's                                 always going to be gray areas in between                                 and so cloud is no exception                                 so in between infrastructure and                                 platform as a service you have all these                                 intermediate services                                 they're more than raw hardware so if you                                 look at the names                                 it's it's not vms it's not disk it's                                 more than that right so these are                                 typically networking services                                 data services like databases data                                 processing                                 data analytics containers are there                                 right so it's a layer that sits on top                                 of hardware                                 but it's not like you can upload code to                                 them and run it right you know obviously                                 you can upload                                 sql but that's not the same as                                 applications and then similarly                                 between sas and pass you have what i                                 call restricted past systems                                 so these are these are past systems but                                 what's different about them is that they                                 generally rely on data that live at the                                 sas level                                 okay so in other words you can use apps                                 script you can use force.com they're                                 great                                 but if you don't do so with g suite data                                 or salesforce data                                 there's no need for you to use these                                 systems just use the general ones down                                 here because they're more multi-purpose                                 right these are more specialized so                                 anyway so that's                                 what i wanted to say about the the two                                 gray areas the gray area between                                 infrastructure and platform                                 again the data services the network                                 services things that are more than                                 hardware                                 and then finally the gray area between                                 sas and pass which are restricted past                                 systems                                 all right so that's cloud so let's look                                 at it from a different perspective like                                 what are you responsible for okay so                                 as far as responsibility goes if you're                                 doing sas apps well guess what you've                                 outsourced everything including the app                                 so there's really nothing for you to do                                 except for you know like your personal                                 you know if you're using email right                                 your personal your your email signature                                 uh and anything that's kind of like a                                 user setting everything else is                                 outsourced you don't care what operating                                 system you don't care what language it's                                 written in                                 none of that if it's a past system                                 you've outsourced everything                                 but not your application code because                                 it's your code and the data for your                                 application                                 and then at the infrastructure level                                 you've outsourced the hardware you know                                 which is the four things down below but                                 then you're responsible for everything                                 else from the operating system all the                                 way up to your application                                 and of course if you're not using the                                 cloud you're on premise then you're                                 responsible for everything                                 so uh hopefully this was a good                                 introduction to                                 you know review of cloud i know                                 everybody knows what cloud computing is                                 but i just want to mention                                 what all of cloud is because some people                                 think oh it's only the infrastructure                                 part                                 you know a cloud is only vms and big                                 disk uh or the other way around it's it                                 cloud is only g suite or office                                     there's nothing else that's cloud                                 right both of those statements are false                                 because cloud is all of these things                                 all right so now that we know what cloud                                 is let's talk about google cloud                                 all right so what is google cloud google                                 cloud is a large conglomerate                                 inside google and we make two big uh                                 products                                 uh part product groups one is the gcp                                 which is google cloud platform                                 and the other one is g suite so with                                 cloud platform                                 many of you already know that's where                                 you get the vms the big disks the                                 networking the security the machine                                 learning                                 you know all that stuff uh on the g                                 suite side of course we know that uh you                                 know                                 it has gmail google drive calendar doc                                 sheets and slides                                 but what some people think is that oh                                 the left side gcp is for developers and                                 then the right side is only for users                                 not quite true because behind most of                                 the g suite applications that you know                                 how to use                                 there's also a developer api so you can                                 code them as well                                 so that's why that's what i did you know                                 the last six years when i was on the g                                 suite team                                 i was actually you know creating uh in                                 instructions and tutorials and blog                                 posts and videos to show developers how                                 they can                                 code g suite but we're only going to                                 focus on cloud platform today                                 okay so cloud platform there's so many                                 products i obviously don't don't                                 have time to talk about all of them um i                                 do want to focus on                                 serverless stuff and most of the                                 serverless stuff lies in compute                                 so that would be the app engine cloud                                 functions in cloud run but we also have                                 like ai                                 and ml we have big data identity                                 security                                 a lot of developer tools api platforms                                 ecosystems iot                                 stuff data storage databases data                                 transfer a lot of that stuff                                 management tools networking so there's                                 just like many things that                                 it's probably around                                                    i can't even keep track of all of it                                 okay and of course don't forget g suite                                 because you can code them too                                 all right uh where does g suite and gcp                                 fit into our little cloud computing                                 picture so                                 the easiest way is anything that's sas                                 flavored lives in g suite and anything                                 that is below that which is platform and                                 below                                 is all gcp so that's pretty easy to                                 figure out                                 all right so that's google cloud now                                 let's talk about the different ways that                                 you can run your code on google cloud                                 server list                                 okay so uh like most cloud platforms we                                 have                                 vms and we have big disk all right you                                 can get a a micro                                 a very small you know vm for free every                                 month                                 uh from google uh from cloud platform                                 all the way up to the biggest                                 most expensive machine uh vm that you                                 can rent has                                                           ram                                 and                                                                    really big                                 and of course it's really expensive um                                 you know that machine i think it's about                                                                    us dollars every hour so it is pretty                                 expensive but                                 look what you get right uh and then we                                 have cloud storage which is where all of                                 your data goes it's called the data lake                                 because all of your data rivers flow                                 into the data link                                 right so all your blob storage is there                                 and of course our vms support                                 most versions of linux as well as most                                 of the major versions of windows                                 server so yes you can get those but as i                                 was mentioning earlier                                 if you're writing code and applications                                 why do you want to do this extra work of                                 having to                                 determine which one of these operating                                 systems to use what is your tech stack                                 and all that stuff right                                 so that's why we have serverless okay so                                 serverless exit well okay first it's a                                 lie                                 of course there are servers uh right but                                 when we say serverless what we mean by                                 that is that it's not your                                 problem all right you don't have to                                 worry about it you can focus on your                                 applications and solving problems for                                 your customers your users and things                                 like that                                 now why is important why should you know                                 about it well according to analyst                                 research                                 you know companies spend amount of money                                 has been                                 doubling every other year they've                                 started keeping track in                                      and it's projecting to grow to double                                 again almost double                                 over the next year and then another two                                 years beyond that                                 so so it is a very hot field because a                                 lot of companies are spending money on                                 it all right so that's                                 one important reason another thing is                                 you know                                 going viral is a big thing if you                                 develop a startup and it gets really                                 popular                                 well guess what if you didn't like buy                                 enough machines or rent enough vms                                 uh you won't be able to handle the new                                 traffic so your customers will be                                 unhappy and then they're not gonna use                                 your service                                 right uh so fortunately some of our                                 cloud computing uh serverless products                                 have auto scaling so if you go viral                                 we will continue to scale out as traffic                                 comes in so we can monitor you know if                                 your traffic if your app is getting a                                 lot of traffic we're going to spin up                                 more instances and things like that                                 and then when traffic goes down we shut                                 those down so you don't have to pay for                                 it                                 then the opposite is true what if you                                 don't go viral what if you as a you know                                 you got some money to start a company                                 and then you spend too much on hardware                                 and no users                                 are there you have no users well guess                                 what you spend too much money on                                 hardware you could have spent it on                                 another engineer                                 and now you're also not going to be                                 successful because you just                                 were never known right nobody knew who                                 you were so the other cool thing that                                 serverless handles                                 is this opposite uh situation where you                                 don't get traffic                                 guess what if your code is not running                                 on serverless you don't have any                                 instances up                                 which means you're not getting billed                                 which means you're not paying so that's                                 yet another reason why                                 all right so what are the three                                 serverless products we have the first                                 one is app engine this is where you want                                 to host an entire app in the cloud                                 so app engine exists because many years                                 ago when our engineers built this                                 they asked a lot of companies what was                                 the hardest thing for you                                 for your company to be successful they                                 said well we spent too much time getting                                 machines and the operating system                                 databases web servers                                 security patches and we were not really                                 spending much time working in our app                                 okay so based on that feedback we                                 decided to try and                                 change this model so that the developer                                 just focuses on the code and then we                                 take care of all of this                                 uh we handle auto scaling you just                                 upload the code to google and then we                                 take care of everything else for you so                                 that's really the main idea behind app                                 engine                                 um by the way uh just because you have                                 an app does not mean                                 that uh it has it it doesn't have to                                 have a web                                 user interface there's a lot of users                                 that we have that just have                                 mobile apps and uh the mobile app has to                                 talk to something and so it talks to                                 their app engine service so yes you can                                 have an app on app engine without a web                                 interface it's optional                                 but you know better is if you wrote your                                 app to support both a web interface as                                 well as a mobile                                 uh mobile app all right it's it's better                                 when you do both because                                 your users can be anywhere right so                                 that's really the main idea                                 it's not just for web web uh web apps                                 okay so a lot of popular use cases for                                 app engine you know like i said mobile                                 backends                                 a lot of social uh social apps mobile                                 mobile gaming                                 a lot of consumer web apps uh it's used                                 a lot in schools because                                 it's pretty it's mostly free right                                 students love free                                 and of course it's used for business                                 apps as well                                 so here is your mvp or minimal viable                                 product this is the world's smallest app                                 engine app you can write it has only                                 three files it's in python                                 but we support uh you know php and go                                 and java                                 and javas you know node and ruby so it's                                 not just python but                                 python requires the least amount of                                 lines of code so that's why i use that                                 so i have a configuration file that says                                 i want to use python                                   my main app is a web app it uses the                                 flask web                                 framework and it's just the hello world                                 that goes to slash on my website                                 and then i have you know what are the                                 all the um                                 python packages that i need so that goes                                 in the requirements file so you only                                 really need these like three files and                                 roughly about seven lines of code                                 uh if you download the sdk you just type                                 gcloud app deploy and in                                               under a minute almost always under a                                 minute your app is available around the                                 world even in america                                 right you get a free domain as well too                                 okay                                 and then there's a quick start i have                                 another link to the quick start but                                 that's the quick start                                 um so anyway so that's the world's                                 smallest app engine app and you know                                 like i said you get a free domain                                 your app is up in                                                     care of everything for you really does                                 okay so here's the link to the same link                                 as the                                 last page so um of course we also have                                 it available in java node php go and                                 ruby too because we support those other                                 languages but this is the python one                                 because we're at a python conference                                 all right moving on let's talk about                                 cloud functions                                 so why does cloud functions exist well                                 maybe you don't have an entire app                                 maybe you don't want to worry about                                 frameworks like a lamp stack a meme                                 stack                                 and you just you just want to deploy                                 like really small functions or                                 microservices                                 okay um and the other cool thing that uh                                 that cloud functions does that app                                 engine cannot do                                 is that it can run based on background                                 events like you know with that bench and                                 i have to                                 hit a you know i have to have my mobile                                 app calling my app where i have to go to                                 a web browser                                 but with cloud functions you could say i                                 want my cloud function to trigger                                 if somebody sent a message through the                                 cloud                                 pub sub message or maybe somebody                                 uploaded a file to cloud storage or                                 maybe somebody logged into firebase                                 okay so anytime those background events                                 happen you can                                 make a cloud function execute so it's                                 event driven processing so you can do                                 that too                                 so http calling it directly or                                 background events it's great                                 like app engine it's also auto scaling                                 and highly available                                 and of course you're only paying if                                 users are calling it uh the other cool                                 thing                                 that it can do that happen things that                                 are bolded so all the bolder things are                                 things that cloud                                 functions can do but app engine cannot                                 uh and one of them is                                 develop all of your code in the browser                                 so in                                 app engine you saw that i had a command                                 line gcloud app deploy                                 i had to run that on the command line                                 with cloud functions you can also do it                                 from the command                                 line but you can also do everything from                                 the web browser it makes it pretty easy                                 and there's also a second version of uh                                 cloud functions just for firebase apps                                 which                                 uh firebase is our is google's mobile uh                                 development platform for ios and for                                 android                                 and of course there's a firebase                                 database for it too um                                 and cloud function supports uh                                 javascript python go and java                                 and by the way doing cloud functions is                                 much faster than all                                 anything else so you know with a vm of                                 course it takes time to set the vm if                                 you have more than one vm and you want                                 to have a kubernetes cluster that also                                 takes a lot of time to set up app engine                                 is much faster than those two                                 the cloud functions is even faster than                                 app engine you can actually                                 you know like i said do everything in                                 the browser you can do hello world in                                 like five minutes it doesn't even take                                                                            which is very fast again it's because                                 you don't have an entire app so there's                                 a lot less                                 less functionality less complexity                                 okay so to create a function you can do                                 it from the web web                                 browser step one uh choose your project                                 and then                                 find the cloud function section in the                                 console then click create function                                 you know choose the name of the function                                 the memory the trigger type                                 you know is it node is it java python                                 you pick a language                                 then you write the code in the browser                                 and then you click to deploy and then                                 you test it afterwards it's pretty easy                                 uh or you do everything locally in your                                 computer and you deploy in the command                                 line okay pretty basic                                 and then like i said uh you can trigger                                 a cloud function from many different                                 sources so http or based on any kind of                                 events                                 so that's just a list of what some of                                 the events are                                 that's supported uh so here's your hello                                 world uh mvp for                                 uh cloud functions a one-liner very                                 simple if you do deploy in the command                                 line it's a little bit more complex than                                 the app engine one because guess what                                 there's no config files right                                 so if you do everything on the command                                 line again                                            and then it's up available around the                                 world so you can hit it with your                                 browser or use curl to do it from the                                 command line                                 and then here's kind of like what it                                 looks like in the web browser so                                 general is where you put in the                                 information about what kind of cloud                                 function you want how much memory it                                 takes you know how fast the cpu                                 what language trigger is how do you want                                 that cloud function to execute                                 uh then you can edit your source code                                 and then when you deploy you can click                                 on the testing tab you can type in the                                 input                                 json payload and then click test the                                 function and then you'll see the output                                 from the cloud function down at the                                 bottom                                 okay so it's pretty basic all right                                 so that is it and there's a quick start                                 uh for youtube                                 now last one is called runs this is                                 container hosting in the cloud so what                                 is a container well containers                                 have become much more popular because                                 with these serverless tools like apogee                                 and cloud functions                                 maybe you can't use one of those                                 supported languages maybe you have a c                                 library that does graphics right                                 maybe you have a binary and you can't                                 you can't do that with those                                 two other serverless systems so this is                                 the reason why                                 because you can use any language any                                 library any binary and of course there's                                 a lot of well-known base images already                                 out there                                 it's very very flexible that's one of                                 the reasons why people choose containers                                 okay uh i'm missing a slide i lost my                                 slide                                 the other slide that was missing was                                 what about serverless so with serverless                                 it's called                                 it's about convenience language any                                 library any binary                                 and of course there's a lot of                                 well-known base images already out there                                 very very flexible that's one of the                                 reasons why people choose containers                                 okay i think somebody has to mute uh i'm                                 using this live                                 i lost my slide the other slide i was                                 missing was                                 what about uh i'm not gonna be able to                                 yeah okay thank you                                 uh okay so so and service so serverless                                 is convenient                                 not flexible uh okay so everything                                 changes with cloud run so the cloud run                                 uh it gives you the ability to run a                                 container service serverlessly                                 so you can have any language any                                 librarian binary just like a regular                                 container can                                 uh you bundle so you put all your code                                 in uh by the way                                 you have to leave an http port open to                                 us so that google can call your                                 container                                 and it has to be stateless all right so                                 just make it item potent                                 uh bundle into container you can use                                 docker or you can use build packs                                 that goes into the container registry                                 and then you can deploy with cloud run                                 okay pretty basic all right okay so                                 here's a slide so serverless                                 is inaccessible for some people because                                 they have restrictions uh                                 another restriction i didn't mention is                                 they can be locked in right if you code                                 everything in like deep apis                                 for a pass system you won't be able to                                 get off so you want to really have the                                 combination of serverless                                 and containers all right so that's what                                 cloud run is                                 it is a fully managed serverless                                 execution environment that runs                                 stateless http containers okay                                 anti-vendor lock-in because guess what                                 once you                                 that we have right it's pretty obvious                                 so anyway                                 it's basically containers as a service                                 you can think of it that way okay                                 all right what else how about our cloud                                 run mvp so                                 the sample app we have is gonna be                                 similar to the app engine one all right                                 so you're gonna have                                 uh flask here's your hello world the                                 only thing that's different is i have a                                 line down at the bottom to actually run                                 it because when i had app engine i guess                                 what app engine's web server ran my code                                 but since i have a container now i                                 actually have to start the web server                                 application myself so that's what the                                 bottom two lines are for                                 the files into my app directory i run                                 pip to install flask                                 um i think yeah uh to install flask and                                 anything else that was in my                                 requirements.txt file                                 you can have a docker ignore as well and                                 then what you do is you build your                                 container so this is                                 uh so the g cloud build command is kind                                 of like docker build plus docker push                                 combined together so it makes a uh                                 sorry uh so it makes a container                                 uh uh it makes a container and then                                 install                                 history and then if you want to actually                                 run your container then you just run                                 g cloud run and then just like app                                 engine and cloud functions you get a                                 free domain name that you can use                                 of course you can always point your                                 custom domain to it all right                                 and there's your quick start so to wrap                                 up i want you know i want to give you                                 some examples of some inspirational apps                                 wait one more thing so this is slightly                                 off topic                                 but we have actually four serverless                                 products i just want to mention this one                                 it's                                 it's in javascript so i don't have too                                 much on it because but i do need to know                                 you to know that we have four serverless                                 products not just three the three that i                                 just mentioned they're all in cloud                                 platform this is one it's actually on                                 the g suite side                                 so if you actually find yourself working                                 with a lot of g suite and g suite and                                 you're comfortable with                                 javascript uh here is a hello world in                                 javascript for                                 apps script which is a way for you to                                 use google apis by                                 op with objects and not by using rest or                                 http                                 uh so basically you're just like uh                                 doing spreadsheet dot get active sheet                                 dot get cell a                                                           spreadsheet put hello world into it                                 and then save it run it and then boom                                 you can program it so this is not python                                 so you can kind of skip that but                                 uh one day hopefully we can make python                                 work with apps script as well too                                 but right now it's only available in                                 javascript so i just want to mention                                 that so anyway so to wrap up the talk i                                 want to show some inspirational apps                                 that one of my summer interns did a                                 couple of years ago                                 so uh he wrote a hangouts chat                                 productivity tracker or or a google chat                                 productivity uh                                 tracker so what does that mean so he's a                                 student but he also has a job because he                                 has to pay for his school                                 and so what he did was he wrote a chat                                 bot so that every day he got home from                                 school he would tell the app hey                                 um uh he said sends a chat message it                                 says start or log                                 okay and then it goes to an app engine                                 app all right                                 and the app engine app will go and                                 create a table in cloud sql                                 so he's creating a relational database                                 and then so what he does is uh he'll                                 keep on                                 uh so he'll keep on logging events so                                 now that it's started it's going to                                 record all of his events                                 so whatever he does after school like i                                 um i did homework for this class i did                                 homework for this class i did some                                 contracting work for this company                                 i ate dinner with my friends and then at                                 the end of the night he can type end                                 and what that will do is i'll cause the                                 app engine app to terminate and to grab                                 the data out of cloud sql                                 it will call the cloud natural language                                 machine learning api to analyze                                 all the work that he's done and then it                                 puts all the results into a spreadsheet                                 and then he can go and you know you know                                 send an invoice to                                 whatever company he worked for he knows                                 how much time he spent on homework so                                 it basically helps him be more                                 productive so that's that interesting                                 app uh here's a kind of example of how                                 it works in google chat                                 so you just type log log this event log                                 this event log this event                                 and i think he shows a spreadsheet okay                                  i know he goes really fast he didn't                                  spend he didn't put too many frames on                                  the                                  animated gif for the spreadsheet but                                  anyway it actually works which is pretty                                  cool                                  so this is the app um you can get it                                  from this github repo                                  right here and he also presented it as a                                  talk at the google developer group                                  uh user group in silicon valley uh after                                  before going back to school a couple of                                  years ago                                  uh that was his first app his second app                                  is using google docs as an ide                                  so what did he do here so the main idea                                  behind this app is                                  uh yes i'm sorry for cutting across uh                                  we are                                  uh one minute over the                                                 oh okay all right let me just uh show                                  the uh                                  show the end slides okay great uh so                                  anyway so he wrote this for                                  for for a professor who's managing                                  students who wants to run code                                  they don't know how to they're not                                  developers professionally so he's                                  writing an app that they can type their                                  code in google docs it reads everything                                  out of the google doc the code                                  and then it spawns a virtual machine                                  runs the uh                                  installs python runs the code and then                                  puts the output back into google docs                                  so you know you can type python code                                  into google doc he runs it and then                                  you'll see the output in the theme                                  that's it                                  uh this app hasn't been published yet                                  i'm gonna try and get it published                                  uh within a couple of years it'll take                                  me a while because it he left already                                  went back to school                                  okay so to wrap up here some links for                                  you so why go cloud computing cloud
