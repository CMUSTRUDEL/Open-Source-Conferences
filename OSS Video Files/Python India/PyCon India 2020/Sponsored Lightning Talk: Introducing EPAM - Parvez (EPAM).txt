of learning design thinking                                and best learning practices our                                nimbleness                                and commitment to strong engineering                                culture has enabled us                                to quickly adapt and be ahead of the                                curve                                okay so this is about uh                                this slide is a little bit about our                                history so how do we started we started                                in                                                                                             organization and then                                we slowly moved to uh we focused mainly                                in between                                                        development                                and then we when we saw that the whole                                industry landscape is changing and                                now the industry is no more product                                driven but it's it's becoming more                                consumer driven so we started                                focusing on and involved ourselves as a                                platform engineering and orchestration                                organization                                uh some of the key uh verticals uh and                                uh                                that we work with so if you see we work                                with almost all                                the verticals and then we also                                have a partnership with the most of the                                digitally bond organizations                                some of the product that we use in                                everyday life we were behind                                right developing many of the product                                that we love                                to use in our everyday life                                talk a little bit about our culture and                                uh what what epam stands                                for what are the values we have so first                                thing is that we
