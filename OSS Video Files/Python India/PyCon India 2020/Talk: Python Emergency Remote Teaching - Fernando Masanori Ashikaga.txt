in the world two months ago                                a unicef report says that                                at this moment more than one billion                                students                                are still out of school without                                face-to-face classes worldwide                                many universities in brazil are now                                without any type of classes                                my university decide to go online to                                keep                                education alive to keep                                contact with these students to keep in                                touch                                with these students during the isolation                                more than                                           of my students are low                                income so education is a                                opportunity they have                                and the isolation maybe                                is an invitation to give it up of                                their stooges                                a lot a lot of people teach programming                                with python                                maybe our first                                contact with the community is                                a class with python                                as main language so education is part of                                python community i will share                                my experiences in this talk                                my experience it's not my university                                experiences                                but community python brazilian python                                community experience                                work at home is very hard                                with kids cats dogs                                whatever in the same place                                all the time neighbors                                also make more noise than we                                expected                                i have two dogs and                                five cats and                                they are very social                                whenever they heard me talking with the                                computer                                in my classes they wanted                                to participate                                teachers are teachers                                are very communicating in their nature                                in the face-to-face meetings i catch                                in the air difficulties of my students                                so improve interactions                                is a key poor process in                                remote teaching in emergency remote                                teaching                                my colleagues are became very frustrated                                in virtual classrooms a survey                                in brazil shows that eight percent                                of teachers feel unable to teach                                online in isolation                                but it's okay to be human                                human for our students                                see a teacher struggling with technical                                issues                                proves that education is special                                is important behind the screen                                there are someone that thinks                                the education worth all these efforts                                i have a static youtube                                channel for flipped classrooms                                there are synchronous interactions                                in the time of old face-to-face classes                                so                                i'm a bridge between the content                                and the learning process of each of the                                students                                of course there are so many materials on                                the web                                so teachers send glimpses of what                                need a special attention at each time                                 teacher breaks new grounds                                 share his experiences inspire                                 the students so teacher is not                                 only a kind of technology delivery                                 content it's much more                                 some years ago i made                                 with the help of the brazilian python                                 community

there are menu some students                                 prefer a simple                                 youtube playlist but many others                                 choose a regular website with more                                 order in the content                                 our videos are very short                                 four minutes long a lot                                 of students use cell phones to see the                                 videos                                 so my experience is important                                 to use big fonts                                 and i have a blue yet                                 to record the audio the most important                                 thing                                 in online

                exercises so the students have a way to                                 practice                                 the programming skills because                                 learning and programming is                                 you you you need a lot of exercise                                 to um learn well                                 my way of teaching is using flipped                                 classrooms                                 with microsoft things is my university                                 shows choice and discord                                 for interactions sometimes i                                 use other ways like phonical                                 to a student without                                 what's computer

                      chinese caesar cipher code                                 another                                                        this time using unicode in python                                   is a cool to use unicode in python                                 to translate                                 some messages to chinese                                 and the answer is

           i using range inch and sample                                 from random library is about to include                                 the library                                 but my sample                                 always show                                                     in the range of                                          always show                                    what's the trick                                 python is a free software                                 you have access to                                 all libraries colleges                                 it's possible to change these codes                                 it's a funny way to teach what is                                 free software changing the condi
