	Making Of NextGen Fintech: Insights From Visible Alpha Tech Stack (Sponsored Talk)

Visible Alpha is a fintech firm at the intersection of finance and analytics. The financial analytics we provide is one of a kind because the we have 'first' access to analyst's data and that's something very unique on the street. We also provide a lot of technology infrastructure that makes the buy and sell side firms work together. Our stack is built on top of micro services architecture, with high availability at the core of the system. This is sprinkled with a liberal dose NLP, computation algorithms etc. There is a constant push towards designing and implementing components with the best available technology while keeping in mind scalability and maintainability. One of the challenges we continuously face is dealing with an ever increasing data and still keeping latency within acceptable limits.
