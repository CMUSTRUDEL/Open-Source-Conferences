	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,250
the First Alert is bipedal van Buyten

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,760
and in that past present and future

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,920
so Peter guy is a CEO and co-founder of

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,320
a Nevada history known as Don Jaime

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,580
paralytics is that a long experience in

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,490
scientific computing and data

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,740
visualization is a great evangelism in

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,410
the end this is talk invited evangelist

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,260
of 101 from sci-fi 2010 is one of the

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,170
funniest sci-fi talks ever is energy

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:37,680
enthusiasm and how it is with people is

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:39,120
inspiring so I welcome Peter that thank

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,750
you very much I'm very excited to be

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,370
here

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,440
thank you very much the organizers for

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,000
joining me this is my first time in

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,489
India and having a great time

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,719
absolutely but one of my power today is

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:59,280
that well I talk about Python for data

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,109
analysis and and what you know how how

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,480
we got here or brought us here and then

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,090
some of the things that I think make it

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,360
very powerful and I think that the

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,850
biggest into the future so I'll start

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,130
with just my journey with anaconda and

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,420
just eat a little bit of background of

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,250
Who I am I actually have a degree in

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,990
physics I'm not actually the only

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,140
trading software developer or a computer

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:29,430
scientist I actually got my start in the

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:37,560
industry doing computer graphics in C

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:38,909
and C++ and and then I went on to where

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,040
really started getting involved with

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,340
Python was

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,230
mm for my joy man thought I was there

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,120
about six half years I could block

00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,620
consulting organics profesores workouts

00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,070
will require I've met a lot of really

00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,890
nice people in the community and in 2012

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,230
I founded continuum analytics which is

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,720
now we renamed anaconda I found that

00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,540
with my my colleague Jack Soloff um who

00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,140
is the author of Nam hindsight I number

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,619
of things since then and when so over

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,390
the last five years or so I personally

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,610
launched to created the PI data a sort

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,700
of organization community Travis really

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,880
treated the youth of the seeding energy

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,240
behind on focus and then we built of

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,160
course anaconda and Honda I really hope

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,420
to get the folk a project started and I

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,910
was part of my vision as well as the

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,050
initiator and then blaze it's not all

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,870
the other things I can follow is their

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,600
current efforts since then and so in

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:41,190
addition to actually doing my actual job

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,959
the CTO I manage things like product

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,050
product engineering for our enterprise

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,510
products I spend a lot of time thinking

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,910
about the future of Python for data

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,610
analysis and for machine learning in

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,230
these kind of games and I think about it

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,390
really feeling very critical and

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,769
somewhat paranoid perspective you know

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,690
this is all great right now

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,480
it can be better okay better but it's

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,500
great right now but what what could make

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,630
it all go away

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,070
look at you know do muster be forced to

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,660
programming some other global language

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,910
or something and so I spent a lot of

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,500
time thinking about that so you don't

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,030
have to know actually all of us have a

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,630
thing about it but I think that's one

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,459
thing that really gotta fix a bug and so

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,450
if you think back to the to the kind of

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,160
early 2012

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,950
the conference we're starting to

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,690
starting the company we had just

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,760
attendances got a bit dated conference

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,200
and that was five years ago people were

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,340
talking I'm thinking I don't know how

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,800
much people talk about being gay they're

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,870
over here but in America it's it's

00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,090
really Wayne it's not as sexy to talk

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,709
about to get anymore now it's all they

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,470
talk about artificial intelligence

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,230
robots but the back to the 2012 people

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,180
were part of big data and and that's you

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,849
know we had a small tidy that event that

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,239
does a first title workshop event right

00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:57,430
after that has marched and and so these

00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,040
are some of the slides from from his

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,579
talk at that conference at that workshop

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,650
that first cutting it and so he had this

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,880
provocative slide where he was saying

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,410
you know let's rather we see all these

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,120
things about elephants in paducah the

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,640
more of a new with more elephants and

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,620
women but what is pythons in public's

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,239
right the toriel tutorials the data

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,600
science stuff people were doing was all

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:24,669
the Python or are he was convinced that

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,590
he did actually you know you know could

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,750
be two things to take python and how to

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,310
do more in the Big Data space maybe even

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,560
swallowing the elephant if there's

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,000
pictures of girlfriends and he was also

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,740
same sort of these controversial things

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,620
like well we should know compiler

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,600
infrastructure so that Python and C are

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,580
equal I level languages on top of a

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,520
penalty and fixed one time things like

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,470
that but nonetheless we the point of all

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,820
this is that we were not content in the

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,889
state of things we saw the pilot was

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,990
popular but it was definitely challenged

00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:55,389
by people had really lots of Python

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,530
verses are it's gonna just gonna destroy

00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:59,289
everything and you know I'll just learn

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,039
mapreduces Java and so we're not

00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,900
entitled estate

00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,119
and we saw that I thought to play a very

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,150
significant role very prominent role of

00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:09,189
the future game analysis now that I did

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,490
a workshop is also very interesting

00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:14,379
remember this is 2012 because we were

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,169
very fortunate to have we go show live

00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,719
and so this was a small 50 person thing

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:20,229
in a little classroom at the Google

00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,389
headquarters

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:24,129
Widow's was working at Google at the

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:26,860
time and he found out that Denis came

00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:29,020
over and we talked to them about things

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,270
like a matrix multiplication operator or

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,339
having ability to quote expressions and

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,199
become more or less speeding that like

00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:39,159
that but we also try to talk about

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,409
fixing a packaging problem and so

00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:45,309
actually you see over here that's on the

00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:48,669
middle is a much junker West McKinney

00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:50,289
the other campus and so we're trying to

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,719
convince him you know we don't release

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:55,180
help the poor development team the

00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:57,159
Putnam quartet understand the pain of

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,099
Python packages for scientific Python

00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:02,110
can you help them with to help us with a

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:03,909
Python packaging problem and we don't

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,389
recently said feel free to fix it

00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,249
yourself

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:11,020
the porter community doesn't really feel

00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:13,240
for you so so we did and we felt like

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,860
that was our permission because you know

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,569
there been a lot of you know even when I

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,249
was at it thought many of the developers

00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:20,080
that were working on DVDs at the

00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:21,639
enterprise distribution there's a lot of

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,589
back and forth between the side PI and

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,080
I'm kinda containers and you can do

00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:28,629
figures and the core developers around X

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,019
and set of tools and easy install and

00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:33,279
all this other stuff and so so we you

00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:36,159
know we thought like this game of

00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,599
permission and so since then we that you

00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:40,469
know that really was the birth of

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,270
Conda and anaconda and we have now

00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:44,330
actually robot worth

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:48,900
we're well over seven under something

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,730
languages inside a Honda and it's the

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,100
climate package manage that we have has

00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,380
a really unique capability in that it is

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,590
I would say the only cross platform

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,230
architecture multi-language package

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,660
manager and it's it's really quite

00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:06,240
something it's not very popular for our

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,350
right now but a few are people that

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,030
would you use it

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,100
London much better than just using

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,060
people praying so it's the kind of if

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,880
you think that we build and we're very

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,040
proud of what it's done and it's only

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,110
set for more success moving forward this

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,970
is my show you has a snapshot of what

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,860
our gamma graph looks like over just the

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,570
last few years and this will wave over

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,370
20 million cumulative downloads of

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,020
anaconda we're something on the order of

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,780
two and a half million to 3 million

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,080
gallons of anaconda Binney condo every

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,100
single month and we see its pipe you

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,580
know the beginning of the college

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,310
semester in the spring in the fall so

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,380
you know it's very popular right now and

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,890
and it's x-coordinate is continuing to

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,650
go over the right and that's of course

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:51,240
due to the growing importance of python

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,850
in data science machine gun thing and

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,360
many people are adopting it as the

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,030
default

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,100
I think latest to let escape over flow

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,700
blog identified by conscious of language

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,130
as as the fastest growing language they

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,510
see and then also I think 80 nuggets

00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,340
just recently did the data science poll

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,130
of sixteen thousand eight scientists and

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,330
they showed that Python basically has is

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,040
the deep active language machine

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,930
learning at this point not that are

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,850
doesn't do things but Python is

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,620
something like growing you know it's

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,360
going to massive massively faster than

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,820
more for the stuff and that's of course

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,070
great to feel by the popular intensive

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,520
low availability things like pipes bar

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,630
so anyway it's it's really nice to see

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,310
now that when we're

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,570
on this trajectory because in 2012 it

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,650
was not certain that this was going to

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,000
be the case

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,680
many people were convinced it was gonna

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,210
be all the do and there's a good

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,160
sparking up starting so maybe as we

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,570
Scala a Python says weird scripting

00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,270
language with a bunch of like scientific

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,500
books matrix multiplication turns out

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,170
matrix multiplication ax was pretty

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,580
horrible so other other problems that we

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,930
said this all in 2012 these are things

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,490
that people were saying those of you who

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,800
are more than 5 years old probably

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,360
remember this number one performance

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,460
right you have to choose between a

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,710
vectorized system like nam Huynh or

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,540
going to see their psyche honored or

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,490
even down the sea and there wasn't a

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,780
nice kid like chilean so a lot of people

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,690
very excited about Julia in fact

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,480
parameterize the trait of my Python he

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,280
was such a big amateur Lea that he took

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,620
those two letters jdu and put them in

00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,040
the front of the renaming of ipython so

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,720
the Jade Jupiter stands are Julie and so

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,940
a lot of it were very enamored of Julia

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,310
I think that if we hadn't made progress

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,140
on getting more tools into people's

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,420
hands and building things like Namba

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,700
that we would right now be having a lot

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,400
more Python julia kind of like a Trojan

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,040
horse there's also this problem where

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,950
what visualization was first of all

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,940
weathers released at e3 and then

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,170
interactive data applications

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,540
lightweight data applications like

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,700
what's shining quite over our were not

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:55,560
there was nothing like it available for

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:57,450
common yet html5 widget HTML MPL there's

00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,330
a weird long name was Matt following

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:03,200
html5 back anything but that was pretty

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,880
much it so we created okay a ground-up

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,650
library that's a JavaScript and

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,020
library for doing interactive web

00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,660
applications and sophisticated kinds of

00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,990
graphics and then there's problems like

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,160
there was not good parallelism or Python

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,320
not a good parallel from story unique

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,570
multi processing you can do like MPI

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,240
things already got to go and start

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,910
learning this like sparks and so in the

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,230
creative gas and then creating higher

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,120
little data structures that are parallel

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,510
about the involvement desk I think that

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,860
we really help plug that hole we're

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,600
starting to plug that hole in the Python

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:42,570
ecosystem so these are all problems that

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:44,340
we need we saw sorry and and I think

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,300
it's really important to just the reason

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:50,700
I bring this up is because some people

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,110
an anaconda now is actually more

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,520
well-known than continuing that's one of

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,920
the reasons we do meaning the company

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,330
but many people I think had the

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,930
impression in the wrong impression that

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:04,920
we set out to create an apartment and to

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:06,840
create a package manager and and somehow

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,970
like that was all part of the grand plan

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,140
but but is really important I wanted to

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,330
make sure every wonder standard that was

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,980
actually completely incidental it wasn't

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,390
a pivot because if it is when you stop

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,430
doing something and you change your

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,780
vision we were still going along the

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,550
mission but we realized that look if

00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,220
people couldn't even install not Hollow

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,140
and sideline they are not gonna be able

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,810
to install LT Adam and jits

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,880
and Jupiter notebook type things with

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,300
requiring Haskell you cannot conversion

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,980
tonight

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,480
all the stuff was completely going to be

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,260
off the table that they could install

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,790
that college so so we knew we suite you

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,740
know just happen to create on an

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,930
anaconda has a way to solve that problem

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,810
so we could deliver more amazing tools

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,130
of the people's hands and just other

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,510
sort of like you know we actually did

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,760
raise investment

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,650
company has business plan and so you

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,150
just imagine going to investors and

00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,130
telling them you know our clever

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,130
business plan is to build a package

00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,900
manager for pythons and titles of free

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,370
language and so the free package manager

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,740
or I spent a lot of time had to make

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,420
files that debugging pilot errors so

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,370
that you can build cool packages and

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,270
then the investor would say well okay

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,890
and how much you can charge these

00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,270
packages and our plans can be we're

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,380
going to give them away now we're gonna

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,090
build a little bit starts to give away

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,220
and you imagine the investor to look at

00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:19,470
you like you're kind of insane like it's

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,180
it's also the same as like a mannequin

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,530
family on the tiny planet picturing

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,880
something to back security prison--

00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,560
blowing up an entire intergalactic

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,020
government and killing bubble clones of

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,340
yourself just to get McDonald's Szechuan

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,250
sauce right that's not to say that

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,470
business model that would be so us going

00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,600
and building Conda as the business model

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,980
that was never the business model it was

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,060
about much greater than he's been

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,040
selling to management but anyway as a

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,990
result of what we have done I think by

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,140
making python easier for people to get

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,370
by making Python the creative

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,750
infrastructures and more people can

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,730
build with libraries and share them you

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,830
know Honda Ford the Conchords community

00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,070
has now something like 2,500 different

00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,020
recipes and a revival contributors those

00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,790
are you know the Anaconda team with less

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,920
than 10 people there's 500 people

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,510
building recipes out there it's really

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,400
become an ecosystem and it's a really

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,770
powerful tool so we're really really

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,720
excited about that and so the situation

00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,520
is 2017 is much better if we have

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,080
everyone learning Python

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,240
universities are standardizing our

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,440
teaching into their freshman classes

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,840
it's proven a production of serious

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,390
places everything from you know hot

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,860
shiny little startups

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,460
yes but Silicon Valley startups like

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,570
Airbnb

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,220
instacart things like that to really

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:35,460
very large service businesses like GE

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,850
and JP Morgan things like that and it's

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,350
basically ended the scripting language

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,360
arguments you know between groovy and

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,340
all this other stuff if all you're

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,230
trying to do is build like a blog in 15

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,750
minutes okay maybe Ruby on Rails versus

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,610
Django is what have you discussion we're

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:54,150
gonna do anything on that you're not

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:56,730
using Ruby right so it's really the the

00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,290
Pythons brought on power of having so

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,570
many different kinds of tools available

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,700
and now having a way to get all of the

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,010
scientific numerical analysis tools

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:09,390
easily has just really put a lot of

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:11,700
juice into the ecosystem and really you

00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,810
know yesterday if I move I want to find

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,520
out what you think I think we've

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,530
actually weathered that bump pretty much

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,270
as this point that people are starting a

00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,410
lot of things available Python 3 many

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,720
people are learning kind of thing by

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,520
default and then in about 2 and 1/2

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,440
years a little less than that I find to

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,870
be completely settled by the core down

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,520
so I think we're gonna you know get past

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,830
at 5 years ago it wasn't clear that that

00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,480
was going to be even possible to get

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,580
over the curve and just to show how

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,010
broad and popular this stuff has gotten

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,470
I want to show you this show how

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,050
actually of months ago but it's an each

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,150
single Iran perfume advertisement and it

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,010
features this very handsome artificial

00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:50,280
intelligence researcher who rides into

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:53,430
like a warehouse hacker space ding on a

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,410
really beautiful motorcycle and and when

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,920
it shows him doing his AI work it's got

00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,920
a snap as

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:05,879
and I don't know he smells like this

00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:07,949
review I don't know smelling a few who

00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,220
helps your models converge faster but

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:13,079
but you know clearly each they all did

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,769
their homework and they realize hey we

00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,029
got to show something like it okay so

00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:29,370
what your so what your hova source tech

00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:30,629
makes it into a perfume ad but it

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,759
doesn't the question though even though

00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:35,100
we've had these successes and you know

00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,809
all the stuff is gone well I think we

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,269
each take a principled look at why

00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:40,980
should we define dominate analysis is it

00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:42,269
because it's so new is it because it's

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,089
got these latest greatest libraries

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:46,589
tensorflow and and these other kinds of

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:50,699
learning things are all happening Python

00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:53,100
and it's worth looking back at the tech

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:55,620
that is commonly used for data analysis

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,899
so Python and I are definitely newer

00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,550
than the old thing is like SAS said it's

00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,410
displacing but it's actually still

00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,300
pretty well Python is 24 years old and

00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,939
numpy is 10 or 11 years old depending

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,499
how you count it and actually the vector

00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:09,809
computing ideas are not there neither

00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:13,379
you can take a gigantic nd array called

00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:15,870
a and multiply it element wise or do the

00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:19,110
dot product against some other you know

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,759
vector or the feed those ideas actually

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,970
comes with APL important which were

00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:28,379
built in in the 1960s so that is there

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:30,929
are actually pretty old and and I think

00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:32,879
that the so so the new technologies like

00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:34,470
machine learning happening Python is

00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,120
important thing but I think the real

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,790
strength of Python to keep alloy

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,670
composition or time data analysis lives

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,889
in teheran aspect and so nothing is the

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,510
right format many mention but but python

00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:49,870
itself as a difference

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,210
we don't work that well in DC and

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,710
actually there's a little bit of

00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,230
beginning to be shown there and you can

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,120
sort of see that pythons are inherited

00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,770
some of this characteristic like easy

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,600
shelf scripting that was included for

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,730
doing simple or comment sorts of things

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,930
and not meant to be a systems

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,650
programming language this

00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,209
garbage-collected

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,579
doesn't even command it until the memory

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:15,699
and it's intended for good for defective

00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:18,100
so I'd like to say that Python is the

00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,020
only major modern application

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,000
development language that actually had

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,910
its roots in the teaching language like

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,589
an easy Pascal is a teaching language

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,050
but it's not really that many used

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,390
anymore C C++ are definitely not

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,960
designed to be teaching languages people

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,820
force themselves to learn it and so this

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,980
is actually really important point so

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,150
before you have is in a Python before

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,590
have you poured this before we have

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,900
readability counts before all those

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,000
design ideas the creator of the language

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,430
started with the ethos of building a

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,250
teaching language that was accessible by

00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,830
design and throughout the history of

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,740
evolution of the language many of the

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:59,110
core contributors they they continued to

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,580
carry down beneath us that that

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,730
readability counts there should be one

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,500
obvious way to do you know it's one of

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,860
the fundamental design guidances of

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,500
python and the way that's manifested

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,420
there what the implications of that is

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,030
that we've actually reached across a

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,370
broad spectrum of users so now we see

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,380
nowadays software developers are not the

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,570
only ones that need to or want to code

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,100
and the lights are off but here's how

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,460
many people in the audience by show of

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,590
hands

00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:31,780
stop identify as software developers

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:32,920
like you get paid for code it's not it's

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,020
not this is a programming language

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,090
conference will be clear tonight and

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,740
it's something like 30% of people raise

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,990
their hands that means the other

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,090
majority of people in this room are

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,620
learning or coming here to be taught

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,480
about a programming language and his

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,490
libraries even if not software

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,539
developers that's the same if you know

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,609
the Ruby conference

00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:53,470
you go to an C C++ conference and Java

00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:56,649
conference and you ask the same question

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:58,749
the entire routes can be done right so

00:18:56,649 --> 00:19:00,729
this is a really interesting aspect

00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:02,109
because the world is moving to a point

00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:04,239
where in every business and every

00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:06,399
organization in every aspect maybe

00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:08,200
research you know cancer research lab

00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:09,909
somewhere or in a great research

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,379
somewhere in all these different

00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:13,929
organizations people have to use

00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:15,429
computers to think and it's not just the

00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:17,320
software developers we no longer just

00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:19,629
rely on traditionally classically

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,789
trained CS majors to go and be a

00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:26,320
bottleneck for transmitting human ideas

00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:27,970
and questions to computers code so it's

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,320
inside my positions I think I said a lot

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,259
of my time talking businesses and

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,210
business users of Python and what I see

00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:37,059
that many businesses organizations they

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:40,029
actually they form these silos around

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:42,249
tools essentially also phone around

00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:43,869
business concerns and accountability but

00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:45,879
they all grow their own sets of tools

00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:48,149
and with their many organizations maybe

00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:51,009
this looks up another team you have

00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:53,259
people who are called business analysts

00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:54,729
maybe data analysts even sometimes and

00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,710
they're really stuck and you sell it

00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:59,440
they might use more math tools like kept

00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:02,529
low or it might use even more advanced

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,779
tools a little invite you like you know

00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:06,399
VBA scripting things like that but

00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:10,330
they're really sitting there in Excel

00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:12,279
and they're using these tools to derive

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,049
inside their dick dots of data they're

00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,820
just trying to either build a rapport or

00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:17,769
find some anomaly or something like that

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,419
and then on the other end of the

00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:21,669
spectrum you can you have programmers

00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:23,320
who don't get paid for inside they get

00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:26,590
paid for code that conforms

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,150
- specification and they have their

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,400
trees right there tools are

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,870
fantastically designed for software

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,400
development building robust software

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,470
systems and now what more of those

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,300
people are filtering into and bleeding

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,710
over into IT and development and

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,540
deployment with deadlocks and things

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,130
like that so that's becoming a really

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,520
interesting space as cloud starts

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,870
becoming a major part of the replies but

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,850
ultimately in the end game is that the

00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:52,660
programmers and the IT staff they're

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:54,340
paid for for code that conforms respect

00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,890
and in the middle it's always been a

00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,720
small sliver of people even a very large

00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,730
investment banks or credit card

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,950
companies that rely heavily on the

00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,960
analysis maybe risk modeling and

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,330
insurance companies there's a small

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,280
group that you know sometimes mine

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,680
called oh and advanced analytics -

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,640
usually took this Connelly group they

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,470
need to do really sophisticated

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,910
statistical analysis and more more

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,760
they're faced with large data sets and

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,590
even more advanced approaches for doing

00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,240
prediction and they're turning to

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:26,800
pipeline I think terrific use things

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,750
like SAS and SPSS but they sometimes

00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,730
they use alright or Matt laughing at

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,350
Mathematica sometimes but what we're

00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,990
seeing and I'm really delighted to point

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,000
here but I thought can be used in every

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,200
single one of these areas and you might

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,700
say on the left hand side but what does

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,560
they sell for something to do with the

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,480
Python script but the interesting thing

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,450
is that you can give an Excel programmer

00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,870
or Excel user you can give them a look

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,670
at you've got a notebook and even if

00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,380
they didn't know a single line of Python

00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,990
they don't know the syntax they don't

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,630
know how to build packages or anything

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,670
like that they can read that code so you

00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,230
did a reasonably good job they can read

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,180
that code and if they want to change the

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,400
query a little bit they can change that

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,050
query with some level of confidence if

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,999
they want a query incentive or from a

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,639
study they're starting

00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:13,859
to unchanging days they probably pattern

00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:15,719
match and get it right if they want to

00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:18,629
you know filter out not just the names

00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:20,279
you know who borrowed assets they want

00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,779
to have you know you know Park on the

00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,179
end of it they could probably do that

00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,339
and not blow up right what I like to say

00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,799
about statically a lot of static type

00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,379
languages and sort of older languages

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,389
like C++ is that really at any point in

00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:35,849
time you're one semicolon away from a

00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:37,829
segfault and in Python you're actually

00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:39,479
much farther away right you can just

00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:41,249
kind of flail in different directions

00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:43,349
and generally get something useful and

00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:46,079
that's why python is actually accessible

00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:47,249
to you excel crowd especially in data

00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,609
scientists the middle do a good job

00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:53,399
apologies no no closer to them and so

00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:55,259
this I think this is abilities span the

00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:57,389
the different areas is a very unique

00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,559
ability of Python and the bridge by the

00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:00,659
way between the middle to the right

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,919
should not be underestimated if you give

00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,339
them that latch they're coming here

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,019
dramatic yeah good number of you've

00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:10,379
actually more people I've seldom I

00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:13,649
suffer developers but if you if you hand

00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:15,449
a Java programmer on the MATLAB file how

00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:17,699
long before the Java programmers can

00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:19,739
correctly implement not just the logic

00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:24,329
but the numerical accuracy stability and

00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:26,039
semantics of a long time so Python

00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:27,659
though if you take the Python script

00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,579
that importance of sci-fi did some stuff

00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,319
you know this is like weird calls to

00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:33,479
some you know FFT being in the middle

00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,549
but your Java programmer can look at a

00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:38,999
Python script and generally get by right

00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:40,199
so I challenge anyone to find a phone

00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:42,299
with examined another mainstream

00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:44,309
language that has cost these important

00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,719
silos these these very trauma cycles

00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:50,219
there's any kind I'm pretty much the

00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:51,509
only thing but that usually challenge to

00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:54,299
which is it just because the language

00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:56,009
across these areas languages syntax and

00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:59,219
use across these areas doesn't mean the

00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:04,049
same person can write code for all three

00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:06,659
types of activities so

00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:09,149
data scientists tend to use code the way

00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,979
that my daughter can use a hammer which

00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:12,479
is that it could be surprise detective

00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:15,509
and usually there's minimal bloodshed

00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:18,149
but it's not how you build a house and

00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:19,859
so this the fact that it all looks like

00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:21,929
Python is a really common misperception

00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:23,970
especially for upper management because

00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:27,029
other management looks like to you or

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:30,239
said they experience stuff and they're

00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:32,249
like okay well software devs they're the

00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:33,479
ones with the code editors in the text

00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:35,460
files and all these like black

00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:36,960
backgrounds on your screens here's data

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,759
scientist and black background they're

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,359
squeezed a lot of terminals and code

00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:45,960
editors they must be all the most sane

00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:47,009
and and so you know if you look at them

00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,419
there's actually a lot of people who

00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:49,889
think that you can just treat data

00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,509
science as the same thing as a

00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:53,909
traditional stop-n-gulp activity and

00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:56,129
it's really not right and Python

00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,419
actually because it's such a fantastic

00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:59,940
new language because it's been around

00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:02,429
for so long and because it came with

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,340
batteries included but has a growing

00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:07,619
huge developer community you can

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,239
actually do pretty much you can do a lot

00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,799
of things well you know there's last

00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:12,359
things we can't do still but you can do

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,369
a lot more to Python than you can with a

00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,359
lot of other languages and that's led to

00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:17,220
the emergence of this early

00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,649
so what I've called different products

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:23,820
but in the Python land that don't really

00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:25,229
know much about each other people and so

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,700
they better folks probably don't know a

00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:28,710
whole lot about the 3d graphics people

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,899
the 3d graphics you know people were

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,729
doing my soft knowledge these things

00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:34,049
that are stripping computer graphics

00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:36,840
they probably don't know anything about

00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:41,070
your Python data analysis and but the

00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,419
other one is using Python and and so

00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,429
depending who you ask in the business

00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:46,690
you're gonna find that they have a

00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:49,330
different view of what Python it

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,830
again the IT software they tend to be

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,049
very sort of you they're gonna say that

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,840
python is one of these alternatives for

00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:58,179
Java or even Ruby or C sharp or

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,399
sometimes not Scala you know why would

00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:02,440
we use Python when we just use X because

00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,940
they're the same thing right and then if

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,799
you go and ask the analyst in a

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,440
statistician to say well I thought is

00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:11,169
like this like lesser or and so what we

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,029
type at the very high bar and so you can

00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:14,830
actually find different people looking

00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,359
at this you know there's that parabola

00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,879
many black men in the room with an

00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,169
elephant right well not there - - pipe

00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,759
down and I guess you wouldn't grow the

00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:25,149
pipe you figure out pretty quickly for

00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:27,580
Python but just working for but uh but

00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:28,840
the idea that Python really has many

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,320
different characteristics presents

00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,580
itself as a menu based sort of animal -

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,599
who's looking at it I don't care -

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,159
everyone in this group as you're doing

00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,929
your evangelism measure describe you

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,960
five different people have a guinea for

00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,729
it within your organization keep this in

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,129
mind keep in mind it is kind of audience

00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:47,200
your your lobbying - and make sure that

00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:50,379
they understand that this is a multi be

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,399
headed sort of thing and so anyway

00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:52,599
despite those challenges of

00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:55,179
misunderstandings I think the main

00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:58,239
office of Python is that it can serve as

00:26:55,179 --> 00:27:02,289
an accessible data analysis language for

00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:04,239
the public and many people you know

00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,710
they're not quite clip tools and I think

00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:07,960
that will continue to still be a very

00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,549
popular thing but since coding is

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,239
actually being taught in the earlier in

00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:14,559
earlier age to normal people globally

00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:16,989
we're going to rapidly enter an era

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,970
where one will be appointed to at least

00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:22,320
Lisa's a little bit about code maybe I

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,320
could write the whole thing from scratch

00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:29,289
they could write a whole thing de novo

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:32,049
but but Python is a ideal way to give

00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:33,210
everyone access to meaningful code and

00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:35,669
so I think of it as

00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,289
yes just a programming language and

00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:39,179
rather I think of it more as like the

00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:41,520
new calculus and trigonometry when

00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:44,700
you're faced with a lot of data you're

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,740
not just you know it's not like what you

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,140
learn in high school with all these

00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,059
analytical functions but there is a kind

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,399
of literacy there's a kind of knowledge

00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:55,770
about statistics and code and data

00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,570
manipulation that you need to have I

00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:00,360
really do think of it as kind of

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,740
literacy and you know the other day I

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,600
think in the future to be an effective

00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,760
knowledge worker in virtually any domain

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,500
you're going to need to know basic

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,330
statistics and python and if you don't

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,529
you run the risks of your job being

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,880
replaced by someone else who does

00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:13,830
they'll find how many Python script

00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,390
because if your job to probably done a

00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:20,370
little better if you knew Michael so so

00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,529
so like that I've actually said this to

00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,820
investors because you know they what

00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:25,830
we're going to pitching investors like

00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,360
what so this is all interesting but why

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,500
why are you so sessle's is one

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,179
programming language and I tell them

00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,860
that you know this language is not like

00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:33,779
any other language their startups over

00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,750
the Pinot's and scholarly and startups

00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:39,330
around you know did Jeff JavaScript but

00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,580
I thought is not just software it's this

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,649
analytical language and so it's software

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,299
the constellation use Python they're not

00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:47,159
going to learn a different language not

00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:49,230
the Lord Haskell next year just because

00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,700
they saw another hacker news article

00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,179
about it they learn Python they're going

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,919
to do their job

00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,390
they're in the home then come back next

00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,520
to your next decade and the pythons

00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,740
divorced they're making using Python so

00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,799
it's really a very sticky thing it's

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,909
it's it's bobbler and and the difference

00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,049
is not the way to do for this crowd I

00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:06,419
think I've explained difference this way

00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:08,399
that software is something that we use

00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:10,320
to tell computers what to do but follow

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,000
a or something that extends human

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,890
abilities and makes the computer an

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,870
extension of the model those are very

00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:19,720
very different kinds of things

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,720
[Applause]

00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,870
in case you in case you can exaggerating

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,700
this is a picture one of the my favorite

00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:30,340
pictures from this year actually this is

00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,960
a twelve hundred students at the

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,420
University of Berkeley University

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,190
California Berkeley anything a set a

00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,630
record for their class size at Berkeley

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:41,050
1200 students in the largest auditorium

00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:43,030
on campus this is the introductory data

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:45,670
science class in Opera for the first

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,710
time this fall semester their whole

00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:49,300
earning title and these students are not

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:53,320
majoring in computer science

00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,880
these are biologists economists people

00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,340
studying humanities people going to

00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,430
Social Policy all walks of life all

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,920
these people they have the gumption they

00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,080
have a desire to go and learn how to do

00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:13,300
Python or data analysis and that really

00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:15,310
that right there is the power so then

00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,610
that's where we are today we're in good

00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,020
shape

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,160
there's some things what you do those

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,260
things for you to tell people about the

00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,260
language and what is important but what

00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,640
is the future right what is you know not

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,560
only futures our pipeline but more

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,380
importantly the future for Python users

00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,510
and in Python gets people who are a

00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,460
champion to the language so I would take

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,750
a few predictions and some of them are

00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,000
pretty obvious others a little more

00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,520
subtle I think that Python will become

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,560
did prefer to later to develop cognitive

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,570
applications and what I mean by the

00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,110
cognitive applications is very specific

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:49,030
thing it's a kind of application that

00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,060
exists that that is fundamentally tied

00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,010
to a particular

00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:55,400
kind of data set they go set up models

00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:58,910
and so the route fit between the trading

00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,080
data and the real application data the

00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,580
data exhaust generated by the

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,890
interaction with users or external

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,860
systems those have two round-trip back

00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:08,240
to the training back in the testing and

00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,850
this entire thing is a cognitive

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,070
application because it is data specific

00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,630
engage intensive and I think people

00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,820
building those kind of applications will

00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:19,340
more more just to dot Python as the way

00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,350
to do I think that's also there's a

00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,540
steady income stream to people who want

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,560
to maintain Python to that X stop these

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,270
there's gonna be a lot of it and be

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,430
around for a long time and Python for

00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,620
death and sci-fi for death and like

00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:34,670
Halloween hated and nobody want to keep

00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,840
maintaining for 2.0 2.0 Xcode but that's

00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,190
not the main top people were using is

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,610
just as your mother got to start paying

00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:43,760
for it another one is that multi

00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:46,190
language compatibility is gonna become

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,870
greatly improved once people start

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:51,170
adopting error

00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:53,420
I think story- here it really is storing

00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:56,150
it in memory so sort of this donor but

00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,010
once people start adopting error as a

00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:01,070
common data interchange format between

00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:04,190
language one times it will fundamentally

00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:05,390
alter the landscape and make Python work

00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,680
much better than everything else like

00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,630
other these work better with everything

00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,910
else to our work better with job there's

00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:12,500
nothing to the pipe but I thought

00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,060
entering into this kind of other known

00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,010
they're like all these different things

00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,480
Python brings a huge amount of

00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:21,440
capability so I actually think that

00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,750
arrow is going to be our best hope for

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,050
the drop long term good interact with

00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:29,750
Java and the JVM ecosystem and I think

00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:32,120
we'll see is more more Java technology

00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,980
things like spark they will move to

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,649
using arrows that standard off heat

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,450
manager non-normative manager of memory

00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:40,789
and so it's going to be a really

00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,559
interesting next several years and

00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:45,019
lastly I think that constant

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,000
improvements in memory and storage as

00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:49,970
well as new kinds of hardware like GPUs

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,129
and in a specialized tensor computation

00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,919
yunus things like that it's going to

00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:57,860
mean that people will do lots of Python

00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,389
on feed or stations because those of you

00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,220
who have done she learning for real

00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:03,950
during the building of science you know

00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,629
that in reality a lot of your data

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,639
exploration can be done on a single

00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:10,029
fairly beefy machine your sub thing

00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:12,139
together anyway you know you can't do

00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:15,200
explore a big houses on the whole

00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:16,909
dataset anyway so that's the that's one

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,950
of my predictions is that single bunch

00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:20,509
of talk about distributed they talk

00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,879
about distribute big data were too early

00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:24,830
I think most of the insights you can

00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:26,600
derive that a meaningful deprive can't

00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:30,799
be done on assets of the data that does

00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,120
fit a very powerful force Missions so I

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,360
didn't think you can keep you in mind

00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,429
that is that Python is what you make of

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,320
it so the language itself is constantly

00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:41,210
evolving constantly adapting as the

00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,500
developer community actively drives

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,929
evolution so if you want to answer the

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,820
question of what comes an extra Python

00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:48,409
the answer really is what are you doing

00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,470
about what are you thinking well that's

00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:53,149
what kind exercise so that and that's

00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,490
not meant to be just like a little

00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:57,980
gotcha or keep saying it's colic I that

00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,840
was gone to here I remember early in the

00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,820
2000s when we're looking at doing the

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,899
web programming or Python or a plethora

00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,360
of different kinds of tools and

00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:07,429
libraries then turbo gears and Django

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,480
immerses the two competing ones there's

00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:11,200
a lot of pressure on cuido

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,309
actually you know crown a king so

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,349
and he actually enough we don't actually

00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:20,379
picked his Django he announced that at a

00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:22,270
side by Thomas Pasadena

00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:24,520
someone who the queuing extension of his

00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,319
kita Aston and he came out and said okay

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,000
well you know based on since you guys

00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:30,700
are asking me I've already made up my

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,649
mind and he picked it yet go over turbo

00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:35,829
gears and the reasons for it was not

00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:37,960
necessarily because of technology but he

00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:42,760
felt that the gentle people understood

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:45,579
how grow a death user community and that

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,770
was his call but the point is both of

00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:51,849
those interviews exist in stone before

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:53,980
now and as the pyramid sort of stack but

00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:56,200
the point is that all those tools

00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,940
technologies that are now standard

00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,339
they're created by people just like you

00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,750
the future it is made by people in the

00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:04,630
present right so this is something to

00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,190
keep in mind and that's the fact that we

00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,650
have about was such an open source such

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,260
an open ecosystem all the libraries of

00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:14,099
them are permissively license it just

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:17,200
basically reduces all these frictions or

00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:19,960
or for adoption and innovation is of

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,069
that but an important thing to keep in

00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,470
mind on open source

00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:25,990
I won't talk about that is actually

00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:28,390
kinda terrible to think about to have a

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,670
very clear view over source and so if

00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,559
you ask about open source developers and

00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,599
Python conference or tech conference or

00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,730
maybe even that like cost on things like

00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,290
that you couldn't we find that the

00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,730
attitude of the stories down the shore

00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,309
people are not just talking about

00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,569
licenses right it's not just do you have

00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:46,540
this license you have that license

00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:48,460
actually what we'll talk about is this

00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,109
is the spirit or the the motivation you

00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:54,660
hunt it's about freedom it's about

00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:56,829
moving movies or things like that and

00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,359
the challenge that we see right now is

00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:00,910
that as the world of software

00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:02,319
development itself evolves into being

00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,380
more about infrastructure

00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:08,410
orchestration and self deployed alleged

00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:12,309
applications for businesses are willing

00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:13,779
to adopt a resource but as the

00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:16,690
enterprise adoption of a source

00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:20,009
continues to pace it's really important

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:22,209
for us to think about one sustainability

00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:25,109
and actually about sustainability

00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:26,890
actually the the reason that more

00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:28,449
discussion of sustainability is

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,489
happening is because there's a more

00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:31,599
corporate adoption and there's been have

00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:33,190
you seen the Twitter in other sort of

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,380
places nothing exactly just that a

00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:38,709
sustainability summit in Austin where

00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,999
many many gather leads came in to talk

00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:42,849
about this challenge of sustainability

00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:45,880
and there are you know so in huddle and

00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:47,410
we haven't really we have a really good

00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,269
organization enough focus to handle

00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:51,009
taking donations and things like that

00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:53,440
but actually there's a lot of

00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:55,809
organizations at least in America that

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,160
have donated money as well as granting

00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:59,739
organizations government funding

00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,569
agencies as well as corporations like to

00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:03,999
signal's network they directly fund

00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:07,150
efforts around for Python technologies

00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:08,859
but but things like nut puppies help us

00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,289
either pull that money together and it's

00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:13,269
sort of hoping a little bit to get that

00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:16,329
every surprise adoption of open source

00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:19,690
to turn into some kind of revenue stream

00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:22,989
to help sustain developers or whatever

00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:25,239
resource but one thing that I see a lot

00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:27,579
is that developers open source mr.

00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:29,499
Stanton why businesses adopt open source

00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:31,599
so businesses are adopting open source

00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:35,259
not really because they care about them

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,809
or anything like that but actually the

00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:40,180
reasons that I've seen about about

00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:41,890
business adoption is that they really

00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,630
just care about one it's not getting

00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,910
locked in they really really hate

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,769
getting locked into

00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,450
proprietary vendor and many businesses

00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:50,950
now for done with it so they're not be

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,539
open source their ability to sub and

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,029
turn on top of the source there's some

00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:56,559
deployment and that's good enough so

00:37:55,029 --> 00:37:58,089
that's one of the reasons to avoid the

00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,799
lock-in and the second thing is that

00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:01,420
they want a hardest innovation and

00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:03,450
that's actually kind of a subtle thing

00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:06,089
if you rely on a proprietary product and

00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:09,039
some new capability emerges in the world

00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:12,130
you cannot bring that capability into

00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,599
your IT infrastructure unless the vendor

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,450
has built it into the product

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,519
if you've open source you are the master

00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,170
of your domain you can say well this

00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:21,369
year will allocate budget and we're

00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,269
going to go bring in some experts is

00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:24,430
going to make the concentrates and

00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:27,759
contractors or to go we can actually do

00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:29,950
this innovation of innovation in taking

00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:31,719
ourselves on board this innovation and

00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,609
so this is really like I meant freedom

00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:35,049
rust the open source world you know we

00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:36,969
think of these kinds of things is

00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:38,619
happening very quickly like oh this new

00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:40,239
cool thing came out for machine learning

00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:42,880
let's make sure we get it in in the next

00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:45,459
couple of months this is enterprise IT

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,200
adoption can take years you can take

00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:48,880
years so many people are just now

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,890
starting to finally productionize their

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,259
commute deployments right and they

00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,609
started three years ago so this is this

00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:56,819
kind of enterprise monkian in this

00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:58,989
gaming of innovation is something that

00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:59,920
different presidents really resent

00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:01,719
that's another reason why they adopt

00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,430
open source but these are not two things

00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:04,749
that you hear anyone and the other

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,910
source were really talking about as

00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:08,529
they're talking about sustainability and

00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,749
concerns about that so I've encouraged

00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:12,339
all of you thinking about sustainability

00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:13,660
promoting open source understand that

00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:15,549
their pieces want you to promote it to

00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,410
other tabs whether people like you is

00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:19,329
very different than why business is

00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:21,789
interested in using open source has

00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:23,049
always tried to the why and the intent

00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:25,329
and the incentives become people's

00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:26,650
actions and so this is based on what

00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:29,890
I've seen in marketing businesses who

00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:32,739
are using for using Python for data

00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:34,359
science and analysis there is a cost

00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:36,880
small cost aspect to it these kind of

00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:39,430
much cheaper the SAS much cheaper than

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,959
that lab but but ultimately it's these

00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,039
things the fact that they know that data

00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:43,989
science information is happening very

00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:46,089
fast machine learning eyes moving very

00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:48,579
fast they don't want to have to wait for

00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:56,469
some vendor to delay 18 24 months to go

00:39:48,579 --> 00:40:00,130
through some paper okay so the the we

00:39:56,469 --> 00:40:03,099
have maybe time for questions but I can

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:05,650
also do another section on sustaining on

00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:07,089
the source that I think this but I think

00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,959
this group might might appreciate it but

00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:11,410
it means we'll have less time for

00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:17,079
questions but who wants me gonna

00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:20,369
continue on just showmance okay all

00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:24,359
right not a very quickly bunch then so

00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:27,430
so along the lines of open source then

00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:30,849
there's a metaphor that I really used to

00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:33,789
think about the essence of the value

00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:37,089
chain around open source and it's

00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:38,650
actually run gardening bargain sites as

00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:40,150
they think about gardening some of you

00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:43,569
are may be familiar with gardening

00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:45,849
this is gardening in farmville where you

00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:47,709
put some stuff in and you wait a minute

00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:49,299
or how long and then you get other stuff

00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:51,670
out and they're very simple just

00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:53,619
combining different source materials

00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:56,349
that you get public brothers of course

00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:57,670
real-life carbon is not really like

00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:59,140
barbilla where you just combine things

00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:01,719
and interesting something that's out

00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:04,449
we're like learning involves

00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:06,519
transforming things intending giving sew

00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:08,499
them up riding experience points are

00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:09,219
getting is getting getting currency

00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:12,299
things are better

00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:12,299
it's actually about

00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:29,250
with life farming is actually managing

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,860
an ecosystem and a whole balanced set of

00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,600
transformations so I think about the

00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,520
source as sort of a community garden or

00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,200
a community orchard and there's some

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,060
open source deaths they're going to set

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,190
up a fruit stand and they're gonna put

00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,840
up in honor box I don't know you guys

00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,270
I'm just gonna think India but in

00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,220
America it's quite common where farm

00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,450
smaller farms along the side of the road

00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,190
they'll just put some of their fruit

00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:52,050
vegetables out for free and have a

00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,110
little box and you just drop in whatever

00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:57,120
money you want for vegetables it's just

00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:59,460
free food you take it you put in how

00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,410
about however much you think is fair and

00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,300
so we're open source dad this might be

00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:05,130
like your patreon recap right use my

00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,170
stuff for free pay me don't hate me

00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:09,990
whatever there's other so there'd be

00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:12,870
supposed to drive I didn't grab a lot of

00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,370
this fruit they're gonna go to town and

00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,140
there's a sell them out the back of a

00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:18,570
truck what is lot more people than some

00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,610
rural road there's others that are set

00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:23,070
up a small grocery store you know on the

00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:24,540
side of the farm and it's an organic

00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,190
local grocery you know that when you buy

00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,870
the stuff it's helping to sustain the

00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,460
farm and the point is that there's many

00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:32,190
people can all benefit from working

00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,720
together in this ecosystem and so we

00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,070
have to ask ourselves when you have

00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,680
something like this how do you keep make

00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:39,570
sure that stays Bible there's actually a

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,730
very very historical examples that you

00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:44,850
point to when open source communities

00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:47,850
were able to sustain thrive

00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:49,830
based on a network of validation and

00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:51,360
network elevation not merely the

00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:53,820
patronage of some wealthy corporate

00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,430
donor like you know Google or Amazon

00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,860
Apple giving a whole bunch of money to

00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:00,630
sell open-source dating courses things

00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,270
are an abundant but there may be some

00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,640
government agency that really wants to

00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:07,040
capability they put taxpayer money into

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,810
it in areas to actually fight over

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,910
source communities that in this state

00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:14,210
long-term rival on the basically network

00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:15,620
evaluation is very rare but the history

00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:17,450
of software and Internet technology was

00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,010
actually very young so everything is

00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,090
still pretty new right so everything

00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,150
that happens is happening for the first

00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:25,280
time and the gia I was in geography of

00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,590
the current technology landscape favors

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,330
if favors open-source favors people that

00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:31,250
are community oriented and that have

00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:33,050
some business and offering your mindset

00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:36,050
in the middle of that there's some

00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:37,760
communities that are religiously

00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,050
anti-commercial and i don't think it

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,550
benefits them to do that I think the

00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,500
Python landscape is actually really nice

00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,690
because if big companies if you go to

00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,460
you know any pipeline anywhere in the

00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,690
world you'll really see Microsoft Google

00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,250
and other big companies they were

00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,270
international if you have one of the

00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,460
United States you'll see a lot of the

00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:57,980
big startups just a Facebook and Apple

00:43:52,460 --> 00:44:00,140
and so python the Python world is not

00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,760
against commercialization so I think

00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,460
we're actually set up to do this well

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,620
but the challenge though as we grow as a

00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,880
community I did a challenge that when we

00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,000
think about sustainability and future

00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,280
viability we don't have a lot of

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,570
examples to reflect that we really have

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,810
to make this up on our own as we don't

00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:19,550
long and so what are we Barney if you

00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:21,020
think about again in the farm and you

00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,460
talk about the orchard and you know

00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,950
maybe apples and other things going on

00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,510
treaties when we are what are we

00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,100
actually doing with the farm it's easy

00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,240
to look at fruits and vegetables is easy

00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,820
to look at things that are coming off of

00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,590
the plants and to say well you know

00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,300
that's that's the value of the farm

00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:38,300
right but that's not the guy on the

00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,920
trees and the cheese themselves that

00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,630
bear the fruit they're the ones and

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,670
you're actually tending to is year over

00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,790
year you want the routine

00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:48,400
food but if you don't look more deeply

00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:50,560
at farming and farm management you

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,050
realize it's all about water and soil

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,850
management it is actually the soil and

00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:57,310
the water that determines how long-term

00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:58,570
viability farmer beef and that's your

00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:00,400
long-term equity so I'm encouraging

00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,950
people to think about this metaphor in

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,160
the the bed for the community garden and

00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:07,780
how it can be all you need justice

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,180
stewarts good stewards of this really

00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,370
unique word of the value of Python right

00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:14,020
and I think the most precious natural

00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:18,490
resource that we have an emphasis in

00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:21,370
this in this farmland is human creative

00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:23,200
attention so that's the soil that's

00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,820
really the soil that's the water that's

00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,320
best ultimately making all of these

00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,240
things possible so it's not about a

00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,920
particular tool or any computer library

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,880
they stopped having these fruits that

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,290
comes out of that library and

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,940
application area for particular library

00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:40,540
those are important that we have to

00:45:33,940 --> 00:46:30,850
those products we can't let ourselves in

00:45:40,540 --> 00:46:32,680
the soil that's the really great saying

00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:35,290
the language but I stay for the

00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,720
community and that that's that's really

00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:41,020
a beautiful statement I thought is so

00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:43,030
strong continue to grow so strong the

00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,500
Python could be you know there's there's

00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,150
something I've heard many many years ago

00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,950
when people were still fighting harvest

00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,670
I thought and they say well you know our

00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:52,750
has are really huge user communities and

00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,370
it took me a little while to come up

00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,620
with a good rebuttal of it which is that

00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:59,110
the Python has a really huge maker

00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,150
community and that's really big that's a

00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:02,500
big distinction that our world is

00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:04,690
actually very vibrant and in between

00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,310
tons of academic users and a very few

00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,690
people that actually create the Corvinus

00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:09,730
Python land

00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:12,250
you know we reach across silos we have

00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:15,100
all these different ecosystems that

00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:16,690
thrive inside this language and all of

00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,550
those are because we have a large to

00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,510
make your community people want to get

00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,590
their hands there you want to build

00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,090
things the instance they start making

00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,110
something for themselves they want to

00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,300
start sharing with others

00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:26,680
that is the credible potential as an

00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,930
incredible orientation that we have and

00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,790
I refer to all of you to continue

00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:32,200
growing that spirit and it's really

00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:34,270
wonderful to see so many different

00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,380
Python meetups hi my choppers is

00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,930
happening here in India

00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,940
I gave talks in Spain and in Japan

00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,920
earlier just last couple months and it's

00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,410
the same energy everywhere globally it's

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,060
a really really powerful thing it's no

00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:48,010
longer just a community it is a movement

00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:52,260
and you are all members of a movement

00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:52,260
which means that you are responsible
