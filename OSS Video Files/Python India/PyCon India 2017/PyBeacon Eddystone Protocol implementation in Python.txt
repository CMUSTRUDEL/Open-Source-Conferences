hello everyone I'm provancha three I'll

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,010
be talking about PI beacon

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,410
it's an Eddie stone implementation and

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,960
Python it's it's a package and which

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,210
helps you use P beacon maybe there are

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,190
there are many unknown terms for you I

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:22,590
don't worry about it let's will deal

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,820
them one by one so imagine if imagine

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,970
you could interact with these these

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,230
posters right across they all all the

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,119
posters you could see in this conference

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,369
imagine you can just click on this

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,469
poster and know about pipe PyCon and a

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,500
up icon and a schedule like would that

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,210
be interesting imagine if you like

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,700
you're walking into this hall and you

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,020
you could know what talk is going on and

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,530
what's the information without even

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,320
searching for that talk on on the pipe

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,820
by a pike on India's website I mean it's

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,860
it's cumbersome to know which talk is

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,050
going on right you you must be facing

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,289
this issue like since last for since to

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,149
last three days so this is where beacon

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,350
helps us this is where we can can

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:09,659
technically help you to interact with

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:11,670
real like a real-world objects so so

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,040
I'll be talking about beacons what are

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,409
they if you don't know and then we'll

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,759
move on to Eddie stone protocol what

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,280
said it is from protocol how it's

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,380
related to beacons then we'll be talking

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,600
with I'll give you a demo of Eddie stone

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,140
URL how how you you are actually working

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,700
and how we can encode the URL then I'll

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,159
be talking about PI beacon what's the

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,500
idea behind it how you can use it and

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,540
then moving on in the end I will be give

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,189
I'll give you a demo actually I'll I was

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,259
trying to give a dime on my laptop but

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,899
Linux is not working with a projector so

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,700
what I will do is run a simple command

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,970
on his on his system and we'll see how

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,180
PI beacon is broadcasting a URL in this

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,180
vicinity

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:56,159
so beacons are actually not new to human

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,290
civilization we have been deploying

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,810
beacons all around the world on see

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,890
shows and to to to to help sailors sail

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,560
imagine yourself to be Vasco de Gama

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,119
coming from Portugal to India and you

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,180
are stuck in strong how are you going to

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,650
decide where you want to go that's where

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,860
these lighthouses these be

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,319
guns actually help sailors so this this

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,180
fact picture actually explain explains

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,480
everything about a beacon so there's

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,920
this beacon lighthouse which is

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,230
transmitting light or data in all

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,569
directions and there's this device user

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,950
device or a sailor which is looking for

00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:37,069
data or or a direction so this is quite

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:41,879
explain this picture gives you quite a

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:43,379
information about beacons so so I

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,060
brought beacons with me

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,260
these are st mode beacons these are the

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,389
bulky ones with sensors and everything

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,790
they are like smaller and lighter

00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:53,790
versions as well so these are estimate

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,250
beacons they are emitting URLs as some

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,780
of you have noticed since yesterday you

00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,579
must be getting some URLs in your phone

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,590
if you have enabled nearby API and

00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,989
Bluetooth so you will be getting a URL

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,489
about my one URL is about my her web

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,220
site and the other one is about the

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,889
stock so beacon is nothing just a small

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,599
ble radio ble device Bluetooth

00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,730
low-energy device bluetooth radio

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,709
transmitting it just transmits data and

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,750
there's no need of connection as it's

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,239
really there's less energy consumption

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,549
there's less energy required for this so

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,819
and and there's no connection and

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,319
there's no - and flow data data exchange

00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,609
it's just transmits the data and other

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,400
devices the scans and get the data

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,530
that's it there's nothing so that's why

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,750
they everyone is comparing it with them

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,579
with the lighthouse that's the example

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:44,750
first example comes up when you google

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:48,599
beacons so Eddie stone is a protocol

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:52,829
developed by Google it's a beacon

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:56,310
protocol for Google for for beacons - to

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:59,159
help developers develop their own own

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,720
products on own things so that they can

00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,760
deploy beacons and then they can get

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,400
location and proximity data in real time

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,500
and in a in a better way to give them

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,019
contextual and personalized experience

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,150
as a growth hacker you you will be

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,069
facing this issue like many many apps

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,199
like I was while I was working at Zomato

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,150
we we faced the issue that the user

00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,639
drops off some at some point in the

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,740
order or user just installs the app or

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,349
even they just go to web site and they

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,150
don't install the app because installing

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:32,240
app gives us better conversions in

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:36,479
then in comparison to the web so this is

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,729
so based on Eddie stone and this this is

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,210
this type called Eddie stone URL based

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:45,479
on that URL Google came up with this and

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,060
this service bundled with chrome called

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,310
physical web so their idea is to create

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,040
everything around you and create a

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,350
physical web for devices so it's like

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,600
right now your devices are blind they

00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,610
cannot see without having sensors or

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,389
some data some GPS coordinates and

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:05,520
within within rooms there are no there

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:07,169
no indoor locations and beacons beacons

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,760
give them guidance in this case so if

00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,070
you most of you must be having an

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,570
Android device I guess and even if you

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,210
have an iOS device you can just pull up

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,490
your phone right now and open up Chrome

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,930
and go to settings and in settings you

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,120
will find there's this thing called

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,330
privacy in privacy you will find

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,289
physical web and it's in chrome 49

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,880
version 49 plus and above so you can

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,349
test you can see it right now and if you

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,050
enable it you will get you will start

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:36,060
getting notifications once once you

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,599
enable the Bluetooth the thing here is

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,729
these notification are not like not too

00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:43,560
much like they are they're silent

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:47,610
notifications they don't get a buzz you

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,210
a lot recently actually physical web was

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,740
like six days or within last week the

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,030
physical web has been cancelled and

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,010
there will be it will be removed from

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,660
Chrome browsers now and you will have to

00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,130
enable nearby API is because they have

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,590
integrated everything into nearby that

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:05,130
was just a testing and trial mode of it

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:07,919
is shown URL so Eddystone was first

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,500
introduced in IO 16 Google IO 16 it's a

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,210
developer conference by Google and there

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,520
they introduced a Eddystone with their

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,889
idea what beacon meant and how the you

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,690
can do so by when you when you watch

00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,400
these talks they have four of them and

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,030
you will find there is a candy machine

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,160
and this is this this this speaker is

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,139
using his phone to to get candies from

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,539
that machine machine just using it just

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:34,169
using Eddystone URL and a Bluetooth

00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:36,950
that's ble connection so what what

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,450
happens is web Bluetooth enables

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,300
Eddystone URL to connect to the truth

00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,580
app machine

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,810
and then the machine can rent machine

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,419
been cut

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,889
candy candies so this is where my

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,500
journey actually started because I

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:52,960
ordered these beacons from Poland and it

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,840
it takes like one month according to

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,879
their side and but it took 40 days to

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,680
come and while I was frustrated with

00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:05,229
that I thought why I mean I have a

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,860
better computer than these these and

00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:12,069
these small PCBs so I thought why not

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,409
if Eddystone is open-source I can I can

00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:16,810
myself create and like library which can

00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:18,940
enable my machine to test

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,639
let me test that at least I can I should

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,379
be able to test it so that's where we PI

00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,430
we can actually start it and I wrote

00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:29,919
this library as I told it o do is open

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,629
beacon format developed by Google it's a

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,319
officially supported by a Google on

00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:38,469
Android and iOS so it's it's unlike

00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:41,169
ibeacon it's supported on both the both

00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:43,750
the platforms so in this case there are

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,539
four type of food frames first one is

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:50,469
Eddystone UID UID is just a unique ID

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:52,479
let's say a hash random values of 31

00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:54,729
bytes and they are just transmitted over

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,229
bluetooth that's it there's no rocket

00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:58,330
science in the first worse case and

00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:01,990
that's what I beacon actually does with

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:05,949
some little complexities then second one

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:09,069
is Eddystone URL that's just compressed

00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:11,650
URL transmitted over bluetooth it's it's

00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:14,199
as simple as I am saying I am telling

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,180
you and it's as simple as this is as

00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,520
simple as it goes actually for Eddystone

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,159
and transmitting these URLs are actually

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,860
very easy and for for developer as well

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,690
as for users so since last day you must

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,080
be getting two URLs as I already told

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,560
you and that's because I'm omitting two

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,539
URLs using these beacons there are two

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,990
edition URLs so the third case is third

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,800
frame type is TLM it is tuned a TLM this

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,979
telemetry data

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,010
it's a metadata about beacon like sensor

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,750
radar like battery status this enables

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:50,459
to get more data from the beacons and

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:54,400
everything the fourth case is Eid s

00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,930
Eddystone Eid is actually same as UID

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,990
the only difference is it is ephemeral

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:02,110
that is time-variant it changes with

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:09,490
time to give a dynamic values to to the

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:11,470
UID of the beacon so we know beacons now

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,510
we know at least some part of Eddie

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,900
stone it's just a set of rules to let

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:19,300
phones know how to handle this data but

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,430
let's come back to the initial thought

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,440
of clicking these posters let's say you

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,900
walk into a movie movie theater and you

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,150
see this new Star Wars movie poster and

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,830
what would you do to know more if you

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,960
know if you're not a fan of Star Wars

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:36,460
you would Google it you will go to

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,890
youtube to see trailer right but that's

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,680
kind of that's that's a barrier because

00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:44,710
and the user has to do some effort to

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,110
get that information and as a hot growth

00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,180
hacker you must understand that this is

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,920
where the user drops off this is where

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,670
user doesn't want to do something so

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,660
what we can do here is this beacon can

00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,360
transmit this URL

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:02,230
actually these Eddystone urls are

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,230
actually compressed urls we have a

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,640
limited amount of bytes to to transmit

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,740
over bluetooth because it's a low energy

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,990
so you can use shortened link shorteners

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,540
and everything and so I am using this

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,760
link shortener I actually this is my own

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,640
application I'm shorting URLs so you can

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,190
if this poster has a beacon and that

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,890
transmits this URL then the user devices

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,510
can see if they have enabled nearby API

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,580
isn't bluetooth they can see such

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:31,000
notification saying Star Wars last year

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:33,250
died official teaser you do and when you

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,740
when the user taps on this it directly

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:40,420
goes to their YouTube app and opens up

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:44,320
the DD trailer it's just a redirecting

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,780
act URL if you are not getting it cool

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,380
so now we should know the requirements

00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:52,570
like where all is that supported so

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,250
starting with Android it's supported on

00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,850
all Android starting from KitKat and

00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,850
then it's supported on all iOS devices

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:03,760
starting from iOS 8 and but the problem

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:06,790
with this iOS Android Apple devices is

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,600
that you need an app to to pass that

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,730
data

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,709
from the beacon because it's not native

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,509
but in Android it's already native

00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:16,839
nearby API is in a variants API is

00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:18,850
already are already using it so as I

00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,980
already told you they have included they

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,300
had included this in Chrome but they

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,829
will be removing it very soon and of

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:29,319
course you will need a Bluetooth enabled

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:30,880
device so how do you enable nearby API

00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:33,790
so that's first question and then that's

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,290
quite easy as it's a Google product so

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,089
starting from you just go into your

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,509
settings you'll find this option saying

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:43,029
Google and there's this Google and then

00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:45,310
you search for nearby and just click it

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:47,680
once enabled you will see all the links

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,810
in it or in your vicinity so if you're

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,699
going to try it now you will see two

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:56,980
links being transmitted now you know

00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:58,899
beacons you have understood I guess some

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,420
part of Eddystone and protocol how big

00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:04,600
is just a URL that it's being

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,759
transmitted over bluetooth but there can

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,310
be many use cases of this these movie

00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:12,069
poster and even posters posters are not

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,620
the only case here so starting from

00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:16,120
Bavaria Germany there farmers are doing

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,449
what they're doing is tracking their

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,310
harvested crop data and they are even

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,779
getting sensor data from their farms

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,459
without even touching the hardware

00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,620
because it's such beacon just deployed

00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:28,269
on site and they just go nearby open up

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,740
their app and they get the data like

00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:35,050
humidity soil and everything and like

00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,689
these are the developer beacons let me

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,759
show you the open one I've opened one of

00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:42,910
the beacons and it's just few batteries

00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,579
and a PCB board and they've given with

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,319
developer beacons they've given four

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,300
pins so I can interact with other

00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:52,269
devices like Raspberry Pi as well and

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,910
other sensors like you would have to

00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:56,649
write that code of course but it's it

00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,519
enables you it's kind of open source you

00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:00,339
can work on right

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,970
so there's another company there's a

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:06,370
company called Proxima in England they

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,720
have deployed beacons on London buses so

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,730
if you are travelling by London bus you

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,470
can just open up your nearby and you can

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,540
see a link you can open up that link and

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,519
you will see where the bus is going and

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,610
what are the next stops so it's kind of

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,070
interactive behavior of these apps so

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,020
and there are other stores as well

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,170
of course there's a commercial use case

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,990
as well so the commercial use cases like

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,400
urban outfit Macy's and some other some

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,650
other products I'm forgetting right now

00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,600
and they they have deployed there in the

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,990
in this stores and what they are doing

00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,490
is they are knowing what kind of users

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,110
are coming to their stores what kind of

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,540
product they are interested in and they

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,040
can give them advertisements or it's

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,830
just not a tourism they can give it give

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,530
them e offers royalty points rewards so

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:53,140
that the user can there's a retention of

00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,890
user the user can come back and have a

00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,980
great experience

00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,270
moreover you can even once you know the

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,640
behavior of the user you can even

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,290
understand that if with this you can

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,570
even say you with this product you can

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,420
buy this product as well so that's got

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,850
that gives a contextual experience in in

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,260
US there's Computer Science Museum the

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:15,070
oldest Museum of computer science they

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:18,040
are using beacons to to give interactive

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,810
tour of the museum same goes with the

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,340
Germany they have artifacts museums and

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,370
they have deployed these beacons and

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:27,070
there's when the user is nearby it he

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,870
can hear the audio the audio about the

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:35,800
history of that painting or history of

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:37,600
that artifact so Eddie stone is not the

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,210
only thing here in beacons the other

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,730
other type of type of protocol is a

00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:45,370
beacon that actually we can started with

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,840
Apple and they started with I beacon but

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,010
it's a proprietary software it's not

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,870
open unlike I beacon Eddie stone is open

00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:56,860
source it has four types of frame it has

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,300
more options you can even it with Eddie

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,640
stone you are a o doesn't even need an

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,630
app you just need a native Android phone

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,100
just with nearby enabled and then the

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,170
other thing is as well because they have

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,560
nearby and proximity beacon API is and

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,360
aware now awareness API is you can even

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,720
write your own code or you can even

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:21,700
modify things so this is this clearly

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,900
gives the edge to Eddie stone so today

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,980
we will will will try to understand

00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,690
Eddie stone URL so to transmit data from

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:32,230
a Bluetooth device you will be sending

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,180
data in bytes okay so so let's say

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,870
there's a URL and every you all starts

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,690
with an HTTP

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,030
HTTP right so in the first table we'll

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,830
see what kind of frame what kind of

00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,260
frame type are we using in this case we

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:47,140
are using Eddystone URL so the value

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,510
will be a x10 then you can set the X

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,730
power it's just the power to decide how

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,220
much radius will be covered using using

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:58,090
that beacon then Dez you are asked in

00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,370
and URL scheme and encoded URL so first

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,610
of all when you have an URL you will be

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:07,900
dividing that URL to parts like protocol

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,770
sub domain host name TLD like dot-com

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:14,140
and then there's there will be a path so

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:16,600
- - as we have a limited number of bytes

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,700
we are we have these specifications

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,370
which help us reduce the number of bytes

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,770
so every typical URL starts with one of

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,900
these right so if you have if your URL

00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:28,510
starting with HTTP colon forward slash

00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:31,210
forward slash www then you can just use

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,910
0 X 0 1 instead of converting every

00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:36,400
every character into into a hexadecimal

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,080
code and same goes with the TL DS if you

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,390
are having a complete path like let's

00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,920
say google.com slash search slash

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,080
something something then you will be

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,420
using this comm this value for calm and

00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,240
if it's just google.com you are going to

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:52,420
use 0 X 0 7 it's that simple it's that's

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,160
easy you just need to convert those URLs

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,260
into these specifications and then

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,220
transmit the data using a Eddystone

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:02,470
beacon it's the same table from the from

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,600
the previous slide and this is the these

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:09,100
two tables describe what are the values

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,780
of a b c d a to z in hexadecimals so you

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,700
can just use these tables and convert

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,250
them so we'll be converting a URL and

00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:23,290
that will be HTTP colon forward slash

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:24,670
forward slash www.isaithai.com this is

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,830
clubbed together and we already know

00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:31,120
that we can use a single byte for this

00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:33,220
complete string substring so the first

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,930
value would be 0 1 from the previous

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,400
slides there's at this table you can see

00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:42,010
[Music]

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:46,870
so you can see it starts with HTTPS and

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:48,330
W so the value can be 0 X 0 1 then the

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,820
second part of this you

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,430
is a raspberry pie so we'll be

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,590
converting this character by character

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:57,540
into hexadecimal codes and using the

00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:01,050
previous tables you can see the values

00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:05,340
it's it's pretty basic be 62 for B and

00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:08,460
same like this so the last part would be

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,650
the TLD dot o-r-g and from the previous

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,590
table we already know the values it's

00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,510
it's that symbol and that value will be

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:19,350
0 8 because there is no path after that

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:23,130
instead of 0 0 1 now you have the

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:27,540
sequence of bytes you can just use blues

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:37,020
or STC HCI dump 2 to scan the data and

00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:39,900
blues to transfer the data so I just

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:43,950
created a static page for this - to

00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:48,120
convert the URL to know how it's working

00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:52,410
so it's just a small it's a website if I

00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,690
go to eddie st dot o n e that's

00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,610
Eddystone and i type the URL I'll get

00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:05,250
the converted code it's just a static

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:06,720
page that's it so when you want to start

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,060
with development with beacons you want

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,620
to try them you want to deploy them on

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,290
small scale let's say you have a stall

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:16,140
at PI big Pike on India and you want to

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:18,660
let other users know about you your

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,940
Cradock your stall or your your

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,860
community what would you do like you are

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,930
going to order the one of these the

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,580
these are the quality products like from

00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,610
misty mode you can buy the cheaper ones

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,830
from China but from aleix using a

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,180
Aliexpress but it will take time to come

00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,670
to you and it will be cost you some

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,500
money that might even record that might

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,510
not even be required by you because you

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,790
might be testing them and as a developer

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,130
I think that's kind of barrier to you

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:46,800
like it was a barrier to me to get

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,570
started and there was a time delay so I

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,000
started with the PI beacon and created

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,550
this using those specifications I

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,340
created Eddystone URL package then I

00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,900
submitted to the repository they they've

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,750
accepted the initial version in their

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,470
repository Scott Jensen is the guy who's

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,590
maintaining it

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:08,549
then then some of the contributor came

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,950
up with this idea of adding UID as well

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:13,379
to this repository because UID was also

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:16,190
required for their for their development

00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:18,269
purposes because there are two other

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,210
repository which are mainly two

00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:23,309
repository which are working on this so

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,799
taking this as a base code and they were

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:28,980
deploying some raspberry pi created

00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:31,590
cluster modules so there are two

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,620
dependencies here the blue first one is

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,929
blue Blues that's already there in

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,759
Ubuntu and some other linear systems or

00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:42,179
you can just install it using app and

00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:44,399
the second one is five epoch Python

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:46,470
Python 2 is also separated support it

00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:50,129
from 2.6 but there's a problem with

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,779
there's a lag bit with scanning and that

00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:54,330
that issue is still open

00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:57,149
butBut Python 3 is quite quite good you

00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,220
can scan right away and it works while

00:20:57,149 --> 00:21:02,250
if you want to transmit it works with

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,990
both of the versions of the Python so

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,750
installing is quite easy sudo pip

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:08,909
install bike on a PI beacon then

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,190
upgrading is same and just you can just

00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:15,419
run by beacon minus minus help to get

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:17,100
the help and this information so while

00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,080
setting it up my window was not working

00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,289
with the projector so before that I just

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,690
installed this PI we can into an into

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:27,899
i/o system I guess so

00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,669
ok his system and he'll be what we'll do

00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:32,279
is we'll I'll give you a demo of Pi

00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:35,700
weekend how he will transmit a URL from

00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:40,769
his laptop and I'll be able to see in my

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:45,350
my device so I think I need to pair this

00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:45,350
with my laptop

00:21:53,059 --> 00:22:02,010
okay AirDroid is taking time I think net

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:13,169
is slow if you guys are online you could

00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:14,940
this or if you have been able and nearby

00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:15,270
API you can even check your phones with

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,270
that

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:21,210
so what he'll do is he will run a

00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:26,940
command PI beacon space minus u space at

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:29,220
URL I'll show you the URL this will be

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,480
the URL and he has it in the system

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:35,669
and once he places enter yeah good and

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,720
now you will be able to see it on your

00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:42,030
in your nearby but for this you need

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,220
bluetooth as well as internet connection

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:48,179
because there's a proxy between nearby

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,919
and your search results because they can

00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:52,650
be spam links they can be fishing link

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,840
so what they are running is a proxy in

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,970
between to filter out the results so he

00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,370
is transmitting them and I am refreshing

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,820
on my phone and that's just all not

00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:06,500
getting connected I guess I can see it

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,500
on my screen my phone right now

00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:18,190
yeah Express PI beacon but it will be

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,130
redirecting you to PI beacons github

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,920
repository if you could just kind of

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,960
refresh it or just lock the phone and

00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:31,290
unlock it we will go to notification

00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:34,950
section section you will see it 6 7 ok

00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,950
IP has changed I guess

00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:07,440
so I lock the phone I'm unlocking it

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:18,800
I must see these URLs it's not showing

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:18,800
up let's try again let's refresh it

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,670
first two URLs on the screen from my

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:39,350
beacons can you run it again can you

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:43,380
please run it again I swear it worked

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:45,870
yeah here is it so this is the second

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,940
URL it's redirect evil again it's I'm

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,320
using my own shortening URL service

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,420
Express Raji

00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,520
so it's redirecting into PI beacons

00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,740
repository and it's as simple as that

00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:01,500
it's a simple command saying pi week and

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:04,800
space - you space the URL so the next

00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,780
part so when I implemented this other

00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,520
contributors started contributing or

00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,250
started developing their own product

00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,780
over this so these are the two main

00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,180
repositories which I which are working

00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,730
on this by BD steward is actually

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,820
setting sending telemetry data over pi

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:24,030
week over week Bluetooth blue ble

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:26,100
devices it's it started from PI beacon

00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,620
but it has grown a lot quite a into a

00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,890
quite a big repository now and then the

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:35,700
there's pie kiosk and this is using PI

00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:39,780
raspberry pi and chromium something he's

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,850
doing on on his on his job like he's and

00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,510
creating some kiosks for coffee or cafe

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:48,150
something like that recently I found

00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:51,300
that I wrote this repository like last

00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,770
in 2016 but recently I found out that

00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,950
there are people who are blogging about

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:59,160
it and I just compiled them here on the

00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:01,230
screen and if you want to see them you

00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:07,230
can just open up my talk and you can get

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:10,560
these into our else so that's the idea

00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:13,140
behind PI beacon was to enable everyone

00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,060
to start developing with beacons or ble

00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,460
devices and to know more about Bluetooth

00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:20,220
because ble is coming up and contextual

00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,740
and personalized experiences will matter

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:26,040
because we are saturated with the web

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:28,380
and I think web web is web cannot be

00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,950
just to web web has to be more than web

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,540
it has to be interactive it has to be

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,280
engaging because

00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,620
ble devices can enable everyone to

00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,030
engage with each other or where the

00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,300
devices can engage with each other

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:44,910
that's how like this can help you and

00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:47,100
now without like now you can go today

00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,200
and you can just install it with one

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,030
command and run your Eddystone URL with

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,360
second command it's that simple and you

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:57,090
won't have to buy beacons and like some

00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,500
some companies some some people try it

00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,820
things first and then they decide

00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,290
whether it's going to work for them or

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,660
not you can do the same thing without

00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,670
even investing into it and that's my

00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:09,160
idea here and that's what I wanted to do

00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:10,910
I guess that's it thank you

00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,380
[Applause]

00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:21,240
if you have any questions anyone is

00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:23,970
having motions yeah so I had a question

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:30,720
about the top-level domains that you are

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:33,920
supports so the only exclusion or what

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:38,940
if something else comes all right like

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:40,710
don't buy like dot-com dot are you sure

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,020
so the okay you're talking about the

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,990
domain the TLD is I thought you mean as

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,150
in platform no games what they have done

00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,100
is they have taken the popular global

00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,690
TLDs only because there are many other

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,250
domains and if you want to work with

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,120
other what you will have to do is

00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:59,490
convert dot let's say there's another

00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:03,840
website problems about me let's say it's

00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:05,850
not my zone visit ok so you will have to

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,830
convert every character one by one so

00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:11,880
for dot me you will have to convert dot

00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:13,500
m m and e into into into hex codes so

00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,200
for dot me you will have three bites

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:21,180
instead of dot you will have one white

00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,610
lick 4.com you will have one bite no no

00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,770
in that case I think you will be using

00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:28,050
your short you are short ring you can

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:30,150
use Google's URL shortening because it's

00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:32,700
quite smaller and you can redirect them

00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,070
and there's one one catcher you have you

00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,690
will have to transmit only HTTP URLs

00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,330
because they're the proxy is filtering

00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:42,770
them and HTTP URL are easy to deploy and

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,770
like they can be fishy and everything

00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:57,409
hello yes I wanted to know like this PI

00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,139
beacon package right in which we are

00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:02,960
able to transmit one URL like on the

00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:05,450
command line like so if I want to

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,489
transmit like many URLs like after each

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,590
other so how do I start a server and use

00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:11,629
it over there so for that you will have

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:13,850
to did first of all you need to

00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:16,960
understand that unlike other services or

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:19,549
other things you will need a dedicated

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,899
hardware for this so in this case my

00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,309
laptop's Bluetooth is the dedicated

00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:23,720
hardware if you want to transfer

00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:25,549
multiple you aren't using the same

00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,039
system I think you'll have to come up

00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:31,970
with some other hardware's and you have

00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:33,440
to connect them separately and but in

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,679
that case we'll have to I think you

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,239
should go with the beacons really with

00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,580
the stickers and estimate stickers are

00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:44,149
there so you can have separate stickers

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:46,369
for separate URL because that gives a

00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:48,710
less effort in maintenance and

00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:51,769
development and I actually thought about

00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:54,379
this but I I think we will have to come

00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:55,999
up with a lot of work to to implement

00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:57,559
this in pi PI beacon and if you have

00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:59,389
ideas like that and if you want to do

00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:02,629
you can you're welcome to contribute to

00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:05,090
the repository and what is the proxy

00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:09,169
that you are talking about like so the

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:10,999
nearby what nearby does is it takes the

00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:14,419
URL from the nearby in the vicinity

00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:16,580
takes it and then runs through runs to

00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:18,440
the proxy checks where the URL is taking

00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,570
you exactly where they URL is taking you

00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,460
and if it's there are standard rules and

00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,769
these rules are actually defined by

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,350
Google a few of them are open like it

00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:29,149
should be HTTP it should not be some

00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:33,379
phishing website some spam website

00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:35,269
something like that and if it's not one

00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:37,070
of these you are good to go you can use

00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:39,649
any redirecting services and you can

00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:49,309
just use your URL and it works fine with

00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:51,169
them okay so if you want to redirect to

00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:51,769
a specific IP address that's what you

00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:54,499
meant right

00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:56,840
roughly I'm saying that the website is

00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:59,720
not public but its internal to

00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,330
a certain network so will it work on in

00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,120
that case yeah it will work in that case

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:08,630
but for nearby what you'll have to write

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,730
do is that there are two approaches to

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,370
this first of all you can do use nearby

00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:16,970
API and use UID a unique ID for the

00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:19,820
beacon and use that ID instead of the IP

00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:22,309
and then use your app to pass go-going

00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:25,250
to that that to that IP and the second

00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:27,799
one is to use https and then nearby will

00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:30,770
work well just just fine using the any

00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:32,720
any IP address any URL that that would

00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:38,649
work because the proxy stud sits on your

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:42,289
on your phone that that runs thank you

00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:51,110
is there any benefit to these okay yeah

00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:52,309
yeah yeah beacons own custom solution is

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,830
there any benefit to using these

00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:57,980
estimate beacons okay okay so these

00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:00,110
beacons have actually light sensor

00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,090
temperature sensor and there are other

00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,010
things and they're newer version has NFC

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,750
tags as well so if you are a developer

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,950
and you want to test me few other things

00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,380
sensors and everything and you want to

00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:12,140
transmit that elementary data using the

00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,809
estimate protocol or Eddystone protocol

00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,640
so you can use these beacons and if you

00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:19,970
want to just use beacons you win by

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,890
estimate stickers or you can buy any

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,960
other company stickers as well there are

00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,370
many many actually and if you want to

00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,750
start with the cheaper ones you can go

00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,240
with these Chinese ones as well

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:32,570
they they work fine but the good thing

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,309
about these products is that they they

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,230
have a proper app and they have a

00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:38,149
standardized app so that there's no

00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:44,419
problem while deploying or while testing

00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:45,890
them yeah I would like to take

00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:47,510
information regarding the real-time

00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,880
examples such as suppose I am going to

00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:52,070
Big Bazaar and I'm a particular section

00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,320
of fruits so I should get a notification

00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,640
about the fruits right so there are two

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,300
steps first type is that I have to

00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,880
enable the nearby

00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,200
so how I think beacon will be

00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,270
implemented in that soon a model of how

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,970
to implement in that market scenario so

00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:08,550
yeah I I agree I agree bluetooth this is

00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,400
one barrier here to be specific nearby

00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:13,170
and aware there's this thing people are

00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,110
talking about that you cannot disable

00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:19,110
awareness api's and nearby api's will be

00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:23,790
there i guess so it it's it's the

00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:26,850
incentive you the the the the company or

00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:28,770
the service is giving the user in helps

00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,410
or pushes the user to enable those

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:35,400
things so let's say you own big Big

00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:38,100
Bazaar or like some other outlet and you

00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,550
want to give this this notifications to

00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:43,920
the user you will say just open up just

00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:46,050
turn on your Bluetooth and roam around

00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,680
the store and you will give you the the

00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:52,050
offers so this is the thing this this is

00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,270
where like incentive works and that's

00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:57,060
how the companies and the the outlets

00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:59,430
are in the universe are doing it so this

00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,530
urban outfit may see is what they are

00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,420
doing is even IKEA IKEA stores are

00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:06,180
actually if you haven't heard it IKEA is

00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,830
like there are they give different parts

00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,020
and you can assemble them into tables or

00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:12,420
other things so and they have other

00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,310
products as well but what they are doing

00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,990
is they are giving incentives and they

00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:18,600
are giving reward points to the users

00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:21,090
it's actually deployed in IKEA Austria

00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,730
there's an even video on YouTube talking

00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:25,350
about it as demonstrating it so while

00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,180
they are picking up the product they can

00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,490
see even by this product and you will

00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,750
get this much off or you can just even

00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:32,490
say you will get this much to devote

00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,160
point if we if you complete this much

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:38,900
amount of order today so that's the

00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,900
that's where intent incentive comes in

00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,570
big

00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:49,000
so using using beacon you will be

00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,860
getting notification so Google has this

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,060
service for beacons where you go on your

00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,070
beacon dashboard and the rest of your

00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:57,910
beacon okay and then you select it's

00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:59,770
very quite easier for any you any user

00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,000
can do it you just go there and there is

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,320
your beacon and type this is the

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,180
notification I want to show for this

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,280
particular vehicle and let's say you put

00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:09,310
it here and everyone coming in the area

00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,560
will get that notification with when

00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:13,270
when they are near this so actually near

00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,980
wise just not beacons it's more than

00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,960
that they are using ultrasonic sounds

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,120
and they're using Wi-Fi signals and

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,250
other things as well and there are other

00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,980
companies also also using the Wi-Fi to

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:26,560
detect but beacon gives a clearer

00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,570
picture of you where the user is exactly

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,090
so I was talking about the stickers

00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:33,940
right so they're they this this thick

00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:36,220
and that this big okay and what some

00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,950
stores are done is they have sticked

00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:41,950
them to let's say shoe and whenever you

00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:44,020
pick a shoe that user that that moves

00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,960
and there's a accelerations X

00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,480
accelerator acceleration sensor there so

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,760
what it does is it knows that this thing

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,040
has moved and then you can push the

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,920
notification to user and that this shoe

00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,960
is of this much amount that's how the

00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,290
interactive world can be like this is

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:08,160
how things can be connected so that's

00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:08,160
that's the thing thank you thank you

00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:16,230
okay I think there is no time we can

00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,230
