Publication date: 2013-01-09
Playlist: PyCon India 2012
Description: 
	Celery is a really good framework for doing background task processing in Python (and other languages). While it is ridiculously easy to use celery, doing complex task flow has been a challenge in celery. (w.r.t task trees/graphs/dependecies etc.)

This talk introduces the audience to these challenges in celery and also explains how these can be fixed programmatically and by using latest features in Celery (3+). http://in.pycon.org/2012/funnel/pyconindia2012/78-advanced-task-management-with-celery
