thanks a lot mom I really feel two years

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,699
total it's a complete honor decided to

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:28,410
compete here is very cool to see all of

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:31,769
you out here we're going to the

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:41,640
protector I'm just gonna go ahead of

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:43,590
stuff on my wall I talk so this is a

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,789
title slide the title of the song to say

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:51,510
a cobweb and it's out the use of Python

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,780
on the web both the history of Python

00:00:51,510 --> 00:01:00,750
web and I'm gonna make some predictions

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:04,890
about the future you may recognize has a

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,979
title and I gave it to talk about two

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,650
years 2010 at first so this is an

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:14,250
updated version you're interested to

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,400
check out the original version and I

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,490
didn't see you might be interested to

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,770
see what's changed my thinking has

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,420
changed somewhat some things today many

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,090
things have changed i have a lot more

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,640
clear now and I did ago I think about

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,610
what the future gonna have to go look

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,400
like you have a better idea what I need

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:40,049
to do to continue to your language on

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,780
the web to look at it into it so the

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,869
destruit is that what I've done is it's

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,880
really not about electronic today it's

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,229
very repetitive we do the same things

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,829
over and over and over again we've

00:01:52,229 --> 00:02:00,840
obtained sites we be the same we solve

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:04,740
solve problems we do the same thing sort

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:09,860
of dirty secret is that much of the time

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:12,870
it's boring and he is and uninteresting

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,640
industry was actually really summed up

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,590
by asking the question what would you

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:24,959
have to tell us how easy you hire

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:28,410
history of the tool in a completely

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,989
follow that a as a struggle may be

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,910
easier make this is job more interesting

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:37,370
or exciting look at some of the things

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:39,930
that the problems that are fun and

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:44,519
residing on the things in a different

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,900
and less and less time another job that

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,129
we don't have to do it over and over and

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:55,879
over so we want to think about the

00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:58,560
future of the web we can do with it

00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,739
questions we can ask you know what's

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,739
broken about 2mm in today was hard but I

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:09,060
jobs right now you know when a framework

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:11,159
make life easier anyways but they are

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,989
and if you do so what's what are those

00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:18,330
things what is rogen and I don't want to

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,640
talk about what we cuda diffic CD saying

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:25,110
what problems are how will I be able to

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,780
fix em and I'm looking at how using my

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,400
a.d.d fix we can start at the thinking

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,730
of about what the future of the web

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,010
might look like and then of course this

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,269
is Python I want to follow it up with

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:42,360
very important question is can evict ED

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,610
problems with Python I don't know about

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,799
you but I wanted to keep using like on

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,810
programmatic well into the future I

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,209
don't want to have to switch I think I

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,810
think it kinda depends out there I want

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:57,239
to see it so how then can we solve

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:01,920
problems about the doll and using the

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:04,290
tool that we're talking so what I'm

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,459
going to do now is hard little bit about

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:12,930
than a history of the web colors room I

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:15,689
call over to the standpoint of your

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:20,790
honor or web framework this is how I see

00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:21,109
the history of the way so way back when

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,659
the

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,879
young we had a very very primitive tool

00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:28,400
in fact to the first you know the first

00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,009
few websites that I ever built we're all

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:36,830
just an enrollee HT now we just rotate

00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:39,740
82 moines no no activity no scripting no

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:43,639
really bad and procedures document on

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:46,550
web this is obviously like a huge pain

00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:50,599
right and we're reporting is completely

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:53,990
we can't actually we can't actually do

00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:56,810
anything in the racket we can't we can't

00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:00,169
polish a today's condom you can't have

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,120
chat we can't have you know tool like

00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:04,550
gmail but we can't build like we're

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,229
doing everything in my hand the mobile

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,389
things you're if you're probably in the

00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:11,629
newspaper do you really want you to have

00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:14,419
to mark up every single story by hand in

00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:18,050
order to put it on web reporters not as

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:21,020
terrible so within a few years of the

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:24,259
web starting to become useful we

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,539
realized we needed a better better set

00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:29,240
of tools a better way to create web

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:32,690
exercise and the first generation of

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:39,979
easy school will be CGI anyone remember

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:43,520
CDI lot of fun right pondle has you can

00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:46,099
still see guys in the Python mostly

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,180
early is it when I have written in C

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:55,789
actually and then pearl eventually this

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:57,289
is also visited upon it's very slow the

00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,419
product of the model involves sort of

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:02,150
booting interpreter do for every request

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:06,409
because of the scale to modern traffic

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:08,870
you know at all and in order to have

00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:10,590
sort of the moderate you start eating to

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,280
have you know tens

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:22,200
hundreds of little dots easy i'll turn

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:25,530
it all scat around and or you decide you

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,620
no site da CGI and you had that

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,410
everything through one master on a

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,390
script and that's really really really

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:37,410
hairy really be maintained really

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:40,110
difficult and doesn't provide that

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:43,200
doesn't provide any sort of really isn't

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,800
a little trash I don't think there's a

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,770
mistake we didn't see various springing

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,750
up during CGI age it because of the tool

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:56,520
is a primitive it's hard to imagine

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,950
doing anything nice so I want of CGI I

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,860
thought on the sort of offshoot which is

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:06,990
sort of the PHP model and in pitch he is

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,390
better than teaching in some ways but

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:13,710
it's not really ambitious move basically

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:15,840
he comes knocking how do we better but

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,080
if it's a little early today so we'll

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,660
have individual files on disk you still

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,300
have to have many many vials kind of

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,630
matting to what you're doing or one

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,120
Hannah matter this file is really sort

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,450
of a better way of writing CGI script

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,900
and infinitely all of these approaches

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:39,120
PHP t i canna lychee now they all suffer

00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,660
from an illumination because there are

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,210
page and what am I need is they

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,060
encourage either the collection of the

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:54,180
ages there's a track mapping between a

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:56,460
URL you know wha da tht and in a

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,180
physical file sitting on a desk

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:03,180
somewhere if there's a blog URL there's

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,590
a blog ehehe sitting on your desk if

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:10,170
it's longer that's Johnny's team oh

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:13,230
there's a lot you know I'm your disk and

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:16,320
then fundamentally DS orient you're

00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,090
defeating game tours toward cages

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,710
because it's thinking up ahead another

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,040
polish

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:25,070
possible and we take documents maybe put

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,430
them on that right and work we're all

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:31,580
modern web users we know that a web conf

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,530
arter sitting fan but it was hard to

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:37,340
think about back in those days back in

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:41,030
the early 80s which is hard to think

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:43,040
about the condom another web app you

00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,170
Mario because I didn't happen to see it

00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,610
written in jail and it's a perfect

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,010
demonstration of the times I've

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,200
allocated in that and I don't think we

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,650
could have conceived of in the page

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,520
oriented manner re was essentially

00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,960
license but in a web page and if you try

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,830
to think about that from the perspective

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:07,310
of somebody writing HTML files I handed

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:10,610
us the idea that we might take a desktop

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:14,120
application and invited in HTML that

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:18,830
it's crazy but that's the type of thing

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:22,730
that these sort of limited page oriented

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,920
tools prevent that someone history so

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,740
what happens of course is a few people

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,570
start thinking about applications and

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,330
then suddenly we have this massive

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:39,440
revolution we get it frameworks and

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:41,270
within a few years 2000 2004-2005 you

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,330
know the framework to be four then and

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:48,220
there are still are frameworks point

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:50,960
this moment just a couple of years when

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,650
frameworks just exploded out of the

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:59,780
woodwork you know k-rails sympathy for

00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:07,340
years taiwan's period what else do we

00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:09,290
have zend cake J'son plaques I don't

00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,150
even know what some of these are framing

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,760
was just blew up we went from talking

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:18,050
about his word framework to avenal

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,030
obligatory part of the web and so what

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,880
happened why why I did it happen while I

00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:26,360
was sitting at Yale why did you hire

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,760
about community log on to my brain works

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,209
well I think it because I because as a

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,629
little trace

00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:36,600
we will share the music / modern you'd

00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:40,649
appreciate this generation about

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,199
frameworks from previous generations did

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:45,179
you conceive attached I think these are

00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:48,689
important because they tell us a lot

00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:51,899
about what we wanted to do as well I did

00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:53,819
not notice so modern that brain works at

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,860
a high level they encourage us to

00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:58,980
thinking of our application from a very

00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:03,149
sort of high-level standpoint you know

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,529
we're with us on a high on a language if

00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,179
you're writing and see you have to

00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,699
thinking about thinking like memory

00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:10,980
allocation and point of attack you're

00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:18,779
very close to the metal very low level

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:21,240
but fun we're not the point we don't

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:24,059
have to think about we don't have to

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,730
think about the details of HTTP over the

00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:30,179
wire when he uses web framework we just

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:32,309
think about serving responses we don't

00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,949
have to know what's going on at a very

00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:38,100
low so way my brain works one on us if

00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:42,929
Athena at a very abstract high-level

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:45,420
jobs was typically your application

00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:47,129
oriented this is I think the most

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,720
important thing that way my premium

00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:49,879
worth giving us is the encourage just

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,069
thinking about what we're building

00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,959
applications not as pages we're not

00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:57,660
using whether the publishing platform

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:01,079
we're using web that ate as a platform

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:07,040
that's a generic bona fide platform when

00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:11,910
it's all right the web now we can draw

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:16,259
comparison in between you know linux mac

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:19,110
windows the wet weather is almost an

00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,629
operating system in a way on par with

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,629
that's how operating internment of the

00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:27,959
way we think about the web as a platform

00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:29,939
to build applications this is huge this

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,860
is a massive change and then frameworks

00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:35,970
encourage thinking about what we were

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,709
looking at applications reporting

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,730
project us were on an order of large

00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:43,110
loss

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:45,180
we're not as much we're not riding hood

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,779
scratch what we use whatever anymore and

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:52,380
we are composing unitus some of these

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:56,250
units are cells that are open source you

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:59,790
use across all of our projects almost

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:04,019
every member has some concept of plugins

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:08,639
or add-ons or in jail case reviews

00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:12,680
elapsed we are taking components larger

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:15,779
components applaud social registration

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,579
authorization kind of plugging these

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,100
components together rather than

00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:25,230
operating on a very low level bit of a

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,760
database and the frameworks encourage

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,730
very happy to tell eliminate they're

00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,160
trying to they're trying to get into a

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,350
mode where we develop and iterate

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,250
rapidly this is 100 reason I think why

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:41,790
occasions and two are tending these days

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:44,430
between applications we can we can

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:47,250
iterate and more Natalie we find

00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:49,680
the bug we can fix it and deploy all of

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,380
our users in the game we don't have to

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:59,360
wait for everyone upgrade they get a new

00:13:52,380 --> 00:14:05,790
version and reload page I don't think

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:11,069
all the popular open-source really going

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:16,889
to everyone here understand the value of

00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:19,199
and I'm not a priest acquire and finally

00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:22,949
model application mom I've made mine

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:26,779
workers are fun and this is a business

00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:29,519
people resume after the last few years

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:32,730
kind of getting set up to do the world

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,970
that enterprise software and there's a

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:38,370
lot of there's a lot of disdain in the

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,769
enterprise world for for fun and

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,199
preservation for excitement you know

00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:46,680
with enterprises needs to be too high

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:51,420
but down serious software but the fact

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:54,030
is that as I said it out at the double

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:57,390
kind of boring hi I'm saying kind of

00:14:54,030 --> 00:15:00,270
never had it and we cool things about

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:03,510
finding any remind us what we love that

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:06,720
web whatever it is we love and they

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:09,240
encourage us to develop to talk to our

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,550
pastor to think broadly to think in a

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,720
grand manner one of the best things

00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:18,600
about web framework is by taking away

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,720
the boring parts and give you a tool

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,330
that are exciting to use they encourage

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,130
us to think beyond the constraints of

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,320
what were you have you before they

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,420
encouraged us to think about doing crazy

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,650
things like building music declare a web

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,660
browser it's very important that we have

00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:42,420
a tool that I'd encourage rather than

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:48,900
all the back so that we're now so what

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:52,410
was that X to think about is beginning

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:56,430
say hey what problems what's up now

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:59,460
what's roping and it is right now and I

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:02,850
see public areas that are especially

00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:05,760
hard I see the culinary where my point

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:10,560
were really are just following behind

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:15,330
and in fact getting our way so in

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,490
operability is the first one the first

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,020
thing we have to do when we're starting

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,080
a new project is take the brain work

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,010
doesn't that seem kinda weird but the

00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,260
only one with anything like that time

00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:28,320
integration 234 we're in any code we

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,000
have to pick what to take it on we don't

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,010
really know right we're starting a new

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,910
project do you know what these are

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,750
exactly do you have do you know what

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,810
what would it is you're leaning

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:44,700
completely know at the time you have a

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:48,600
baby may have a master SAS maybe you

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:51,810
should have a product launch isn't it

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:58,410
weird we have to lock ourselves into a

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:59,970
limited constraint set of tools first we

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,400
don't realize you chose have been wrong

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:08,710
for weeks months even the years that's

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:11,680
ha no problem you know frameworks good

00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:14,140
because they may hold us get our job

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,100
done but unfortunately the frameworks

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:20,710
already pocketed right we're suck if you

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:24,130
build an app on you decide to draw him

00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:28,290
for you the table you want to use how

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:32,620
much he did it to sway it's a lot right

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:35,200
if you decide and then that's only into

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,020
another project I premium you know what

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,560
would you type on the wrong now she

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:44,770
weighs just ridiculous so we get it

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,830
locked in very very quickly and as other

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:51,640
people writing tools people producing

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:53,920
software for other users people riding

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,250
frameworks this isn't that we should not

00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,350
be we shall be gaining popularity

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:10,510
turlock that's not that it's not the

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:12,420
open source we're not exercised so we

00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:16,660
need to remember it you know the primary

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:19,180
sources right we're not we're not

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:23,110
dealing with situation where there's a

00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,910
large financial cost tool you don't by

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,990
any way that framework you just happen

00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:31,390
to leave so the fundamental unit of the

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,940
currency we have in our community is

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,460
good well and we need to do the best we

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,110
can to keep our users happy and what

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,230
that means we're going to come to web

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:45,240
frameworks is making it possible to move

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:48,850
away quickly what happened is over time

00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:53,290
your website comes to me instead and

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:58,930
what I mean by this is you'll started

00:18:53,290 --> 00:19:01,440
already new website and perhaps what use

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:06,220
it and it works well for you for

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,980
promotions you know like most is sort of

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,920
the design for some sort of average area

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,930
it's it's okay for remote steeple it's

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,840
not really the best for anymore everyone

00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:20,690
but it's mostly okay for all

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:24,410
but over time you might discover that

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:27,530
the tools or building just doesn't work

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:30,320
with those constraints maybe you are

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,420
building a new building a blogging

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,910
platform and you wanted to give your

00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:39,260
users the ability to skin the website

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:41,360
well it's an embossed so you can't let

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,120
on positive users and edit their own

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,510
animals that that would be a security

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,150
problem so now your situation where you

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:53,480
can show you a framework because you

00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:56,020
chose it because of the framework and

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,060
did it to you and now you have this way

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:02,270
what happened is gone for me in general

00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,950
reading every site you need to do to

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,050
being specific now you have a

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,440
domain-specific need your property needs

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:14,410
to grow to match that Wayne how easy is

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:20,600
it just a throwaway replace it with one

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:23,230
you know Ginny to have that does the

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,420
best frameworks see control basically

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,220
you know I shows in half because opinion

00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:32,780
channel in a pretty of the light if you

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:36,740
need to it would be much harder just

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:39,830
wish to different or am Lauren didn't do

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:44,180
wanted to do it would even harder to

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:46,670
different operations what do you want to

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,470
do it would be nearly impossible to

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:53,270
switch to different routing system

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:56,000
rather than Japan to do so would have

00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:58,430
different amounts long different levels

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,770
of their exact and we should try to

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:06,560
remember that are our goal to be as

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:11,020
software rose and I've people sighs

00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:13,250
become a more more day need moar replace

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,570
component that they don't scale what are

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:19,280
doing we need to remember to the

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,780
framework of the best way where should

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,900
have started to gradually recede

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,600
background gradually you should be able

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,179
to replace it if I did

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,740
you realize really not using it anymore

00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:39,070
you now replace every charity this is

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:41,020
how r ought to there's all the way there

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,770
are problems between frameworks of

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:47,110
course you can sort of use multiple

00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:51,910
remorse together you can come in it

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:54,370
together but if you look very clunky

00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:58,169
Wright anyone's done it knows that it is

00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:02,260
a very coarse graining very raw fairly

00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:08,350
you know on untying the way I'm eating

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:11,590
together mobile applications I think we

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:15,039
can find some areas a crime I'm not sure

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:18,970
that I'm not going to be necessarily any

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:22,929
situation even though we were talking to

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:26,440
one master by my premium all you know in

00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:29,860
theory you could throw a it's in eternal

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:33,250
and replacing them with period that's

00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:35,320
realistic you know we're we're open to

00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:39,909
operate on the basis of five year plans

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,289
right we don't plan these masks you that

00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:44,429
we weren't having too much more have had

00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:48,220
or an incremental bit by i didn't--we

00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:52,659
but i do think even if we can have sort

00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:56,200
of true framework interoperability we do

00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:59,950
have common problems quickly become an

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:03,370
author of hearing a pop song very hot

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,230
and he pointed out that all of us

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,409
everyone in the world it is

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:11,320
dependent on pike on hydrogen and i

00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:14,500
ended up particularly fantastic right

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:18,700
now one of the things he mentioned was

00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,669
that virtual end is a tool that most

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,470
Python programmers ought to be using but

00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:26,740
it actually really hard to explain new

00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:30,250
programmers shabaab it's a weird little

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:34,390
tool you don't really know dude it kind

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:36,490
of it as well as too late and none of us

00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,280
none of our different communities is

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:44,020
doing a good job selling a store

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:47,320
our users and so you know sure you know

00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:50,200
we have occasionally seriously we could

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,630
add some commercial and soft to James

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,070
documentation but we need anything

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:59,130
specific why not contribute to the plan

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:02,140
documentation and help the entire

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:04,090
community there are the area that we all

00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,630
dependent on and we can all work

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:09,670
together on improving them whe I thought

00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,610
has problems dealing with streaming

00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:20,920
responses we could you know all get

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:24,570
together do that flat solution so we

00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:31,780
should be working as first that's how a

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:34,060
second third as Jamie there is where

00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,000
when we can work together and I'm

00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,950
working to improve these honkies

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,570
confidence I think it could be fun world

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,640
the way we're going to solve

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,890
interoperability it isn't through some

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,200
random sweetening plans grand sweeping

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,690
magician but the way the programmers

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,390
kind of solve everything a little bit at

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:58,020
a time but if I did like a like it's so

00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,020
rad we get anything

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,660
you

00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:14,179
so I'm Dario and we've seen more and

00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:18,110
more of these just really amazing

00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:20,330
fantastic fantastic a great applications

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:23,419
can you remember the first time you

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:26,749
follow google maps because i did bloom I

00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:30,289
forget in mind I just couldn't believe

00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:32,149
that anything like that anything like

00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:35,299
this could be built in a web browser it

00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:38,929
was just totally it was totally my

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:44,299
modeling I had the same experience but

00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:48,619
the first time I saw the same experience

00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:51,169
a little cheese and a dozen people in

00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:55,070
all at once again it was kind of like

00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:57,889
whoa what's going on here we're doing

00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,809
people are doing about now that I don't

00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:03,289
think I don't think we knew where we're

00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:08,139
possible until a few years ago you know

00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:12,859
normally they lumped under the berry

00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:15,309
html5 and all these at Turf years I do

00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:21,440
it with a writer because I'm in Commodus

00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:24,019
job along with every non-communication

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,809
alive a shorthand for all the cool stuff

00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:29,269
going on on the front end right all the

00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:31,759
cool things that are possible anybody

00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:35,840
browsers that were possible just a

00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,399
couple years ago and I think html5 you

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,359
get the best inning ever been added into

00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:44,419
a frame works because of suddenly

00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:47,239
suddenly jail is a competitor to Coco

00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:49,399
right suddenly back and web frameworks

00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:52,159
are competitors to have front-end

00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:54,999
application dolls now i'm going to

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,519
choose i want to write a mole that right

00:26:54,999 --> 00:27:01,519
well i could I haven't even decided to

00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:03,889
have using a using you know the Android

00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:06,609
certificate guys order would add a

00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:10,279
little website but the fact is both are

00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:12,230
equally telling we actually have a few

00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:14,899
we actually have a little bit of choices

00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:17,940
and they're not just about there just

00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:24,809
about to one of the a cursor

00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:26,730
right so this new router stuff might be

00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,039
the best thing to happen to us framing

00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,990
for people because it pushes the

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,850
boundaries of what were able to do it

00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:38,399
without honor just just on lab we now

00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:41,850
put your shut up on the phone on desktop

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:44,580
in a way that we couldn't however our

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:47,399
current problems just don't fit they

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:51,389
simply don't get us to where we wanted

00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:55,350
to go when I said you know Jo as a

00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:59,059
competitor to Coco anyone's done whose

00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:04,620
program vote probably gave me a little

00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:07,250
is it a lot harder right are you as web

00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:11,730
app then it is right it is that s haba

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:14,039
still the biggest display for all to the

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:17,159
start to fall apart whole thing blows up

00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:25,350
in our faces it is a so-called real I'm

00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:27,330
at and what we actually is where changes

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,909
the 98 come on web browser are

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,389
automatically synced back to the server

00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:35,940
and it probably it asked everyone else

00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:39,600
when I talk about you know finally

00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,580
editing that's real time that's the type

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,289
of behavior than a hulking out there and

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:47,070
when you see application to you that

00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:48,899
it's absolutely stunning so I'm going to

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:53,159
talk a little bit about meteor here and

00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:56,399
I just want to show a little bit more

00:28:53,159 --> 00:29:03,210
meteor is a new new web framework it's

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:06,269
maybe six month old and they have the

00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:09,210
disk reading hat if you voted me needed

00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:11,759
a streaming hat there I'm just on it and

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:13,500
it's an emoji deciding the most exciting

00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,139
thing I've seen any web technologies I

00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,420
watched the rails reading cast whatever

00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:20,710
years ago

00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:25,970
it's the most compelling new thing

00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:28,340
happen and i want to show you here i'm

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,990
going to try holding the microphone you

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,240
hear the narration we'll see you this

00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:43,010
work but i'll tell you even if you can't

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:46,610
wait here all the clean up and go into

00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:50,000
the threes motto I just wanna go past

00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:52,730
insert of it and I to the commands a few

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:58,310
days let see that again sitter blue

00:29:52,730 --> 00:30:00,650
Turner Green two things to do here first

00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:03,140
the dogs out updated immediately all by

00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:06,200
itself I changed it it and then the set

00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:10,190
out of this there's no class no bunnies

00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,500
and no clothes he showed us works satin

00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:14,690
somehow I just assume all the way they

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:18,560
feel on the fine you've never seen this

00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:21,200
before but this one necessarily work on

00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,900
a server didn't either there is a

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,100
certain guy and a client api their

00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:29,390
justice at the beauty of your popcorn

00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:31,850
avi and it works everywhere but not to

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:34,310
be clear all this is insane to the

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:37,100
server take a look I hope another router

00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:39,470
and it's all good you don't have to

00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,720
define but an appointment sir they put

00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,510
the client call them need your wires all

00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,130
of up forgive you and when would you say

00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,770
that meteor warriors all up you that

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,200
Elizabeth erections not only just you

00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,880
just you say back to the server but the

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,820
point is also losing it continues is

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,710
coming back down from the server so when

00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,450
I needed change one tomato it

00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:06,590
automatically interviews all the windows

00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:09,800
without any other code such a thing you

00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:13,250
got right just like dad what's going on

00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:17,180
here is I jaws a stretch run on the

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:19,660
front end I'm actually my god is he

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:23,470
fighting I mean ever have to tomorrow ed

00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:28,150
dossett's we meet Adele any my browser

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:29,880
that is being pushed back the server /

00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,460
CD

00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:38,160
how magically coming back to my brother

00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:42,780
and my mobile browsers say hi and then

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:46,440
this is for lines of code right this is

00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:50,850
my mind it doesn't mind you're not

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,910
paying attention when when when they say

00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:58,440
this is really happy for this isn't

00:31:53,910 --> 00:32:01,740
something heinous you may have seen ed

00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:05,450
and elect so let's go a little bit more

00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,450
min then imma talk some more about it

00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,420
changes information so let us know that

00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,830
if you do to look like that how about a

00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,320
late but so so people can say all the

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:20,450
colors they're like it's five lines of

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,450
code above an event handler

00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:39,510
pretty slow I don't know if you noticed

00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:42,080
when the one of those changed I have

00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:45,210
actually for themselves so the front

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,120
understands sorting hater that is also

00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,310
somehow no one on that there's a van

00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,650
coming saying you know any permanent

00:32:50,310 --> 00:33:01,340
green and then really knows restore

00:32:52,650 --> 00:33:04,980
dissolve in that is so stark about about

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:08,130
right i mean you've got all the man in

00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:12,240
the front there's no limitation yes

00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:14,910
that's really scary right now it's

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,110
taking them a long time clearly trying

00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:21,600
to solve this problem associated all the

00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:24,300
way up to the web browser they took a

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:29,520
ton of extra Kalani's is totally weird i

00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:32,850
was i was very painful all data so i can

00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:35,790
come in to take but set all that aside i

00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,890
go with meteor necessarily like a 13

00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:40,620
work is going to you know blast-off

00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:45,900
become hugely popular there's reason the

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:48,360
dividers reason to not but we really

00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:51,390
think this is not a future of web

00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:54,270
applications perhaps it'll be different

00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:57,510
tool perhaps to look the actual software

00:33:54,270 --> 00:34:01,860
a little very different but but this is

00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:07,440
how this is a glimpse you with tiny

00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:09,570
mortal compuserve the you know if we eat

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,570
if we thinking about real time from a

00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:15,929
user perspective we actually made a

00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:18,090
discovery that we refer to this before

00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:21,840
we actually thinking about thinking

00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:23,460
about applications i mean what is the

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,460
traditional website it's kind of a weird

00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:29,190
thing where we think about filling out a

00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:33,230
form we sort of we sort of a bunch of

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:35,970
reform when we click submit that form

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,800
send into the office of the server like

00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:40,399
processes and thinking sajjad and then

00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,399
kind of kickback

00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:48,159
that's weird right like what what

00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:50,710
applications like that you don't like

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,230
hell I'm gonna play the song in a salon

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,569
in an and a song okay and then I

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,589
kind of think about it and says oh wait

00:34:55,569 --> 00:35:02,500
no we can't play that song you just play

00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:04,930
music place right and then if there were

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:08,680
multiple people all you live in document

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:11,049
why should I see where my you know my

00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,559
friends are in that in that hot minute

00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:18,789
now I actually think realize the more

00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:24,190
natural it makes more sense to users

00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:27,579
that a district and nationally I think

00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:31,240
most guys would benefit immensely from

00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:33,369
having some sort of beta for work for a

00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,069
real time application in a sort of easy

00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:38,440
transparent cinema way I think you only

00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:41,230
mean that we're not dealing with the

00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:46,380
stuff right now is because I just ribbin

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:51,130
hard so this is hospital and I don t

00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:55,150
haga media on Python in real time of

00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:59,339
that so completely as possible there's

00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:04,210
no one you at present at home either

00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:08,410
Jago sort of proof of contact one a real

00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:11,670
application j Mike Otis it's pretty

00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:14,470
moment in the three-minute lovely um

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:16,180
basically an application that's mobile

00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:23,289
users who their favorite color and

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:26,109
you'll see everyone else in to everyone

00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:29,200
I can drag it officer no it isn't it if

00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:36,460
the application same sort of stuff that

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:42,400
meteors doing it in tight on you so it

00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:46,799
possible by so it looks like you've got

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,460
your brother you got your dang you

00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:51,970
encode you run an OP

00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,830
one server and I are you were gonna nap

00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:58,849
so be thinking back to application

00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:00,890
development of you know is higher we're

00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:03,349
doing like a pun on the top here that

00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:08,359
traditionally wasn't wasn't all done by

00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:10,780
a web server right that's it Apache code

00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:13,160
we've got out to school on a degree no

00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:16,400
changes are made really fresh and

00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,660
browser games including a defining an

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,710
end and completed engines and for

00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,720
improvisation all sorts of different

00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,369
things that we're getting for free and

00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,400
so we with lending a single application

00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:30,500
is another one logical unit we don't

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,500
talk about a bunch of different

00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,349
components we talked about in the

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,349
framework it's very very suitable really

00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:41,440
we make it a bunch of our problems all

00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:45,230
the river otters have taking them to

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,420
problems encapsulated in Venice

00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,609
practices and handed it to you on a

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,010
silver platter saying you feel the

00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:54,589
website Jane go into the miracle will be

00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:58,310
very easy for people don't knowbut on

00:37:54,589 --> 00:38:01,369
the web the last produce compelling

00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:04,060
experiences so now look what we have to

00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:06,650
do if we wanted to create a real time

00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:10,670
but we gotta change no but we also need

00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:12,890
a vented I oh so we ended up in unity

00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:16,160
engine we need to be able to queue up

00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:18,680
change man to our models too erratic

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,960
skew and we be able to communicate with

00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,640
the browser so we talk about if you can

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,720
hit with a browser and on the browser

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:30,320
side we eat a library funny side be able

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:33,380
to talk to sock deal with models so for

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,980
that setup 1000 uses a cologne we have

00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:40,220
the whole complicated set of keys at all

00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:43,670
fit all fit together you know I can do

00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:47,119
this probably any of you can you're here

00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:50,000
at a conference on hike on but this is

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,930
not accessible to you use either users

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,950
new to python indigo or new to web

00:38:53,930 --> 00:39:00,900
development if instead of just we hold

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:05,970
Ebola first you have to install that it

00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:07,560
we highly it that's fun now that you

00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:10,200
have to set up you have set it up he is

00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,930
a little broker you have to create that

00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,930
it is fashion between socket i/o and

00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:20,100
Django you have to understand how

00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:22,800
talking about open in case with rolling

00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:25,910
fall back you have to understand exact

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,410
plan side which probably means that

00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:35,280
you're you know you have to understand

00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:38,670
you know athinon manipulation that's the

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,150
point that sounds like gobbledygook at

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:50,160
because it is right so what you need to

00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:54,770
do to actually pull off again later not

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:58,440
bad when I want to take out the longer

00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:01,080
actually understandably to it all in an

00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,290
hour understand that's really pretty

00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:08,220
good I was just over the next 18

00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:12,290
external packages right Jo is one but

00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:17,250
there's like all the other ones um I

00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:22,440
actually think I'm anyway so that

00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:28,740
includes like Rio and and GN jewnicorn

00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:31,680
and Senator do before different sir

00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:36,390
visit if you have to run and start so

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:40,880
the man is on one server it's like start

00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:49,080
geckos are anyway you end up my

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:51,990
forwarding actually or change memory so

00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,480
look at that video to the application

00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:57,870
it's not the guy's a min about Colorado

00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:03,360
this is the young this is the voting

00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:07,380
thing I just that's a twelve toed fit on

00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,940
a single screen there's no awakened

00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,090
normal libraries other than either

00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:14,490
yourself it's just a mediator and then

00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:17,100
there's one running service meteor

00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:18,930
right so which one of these more that's

00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,710
all which one of these is easier to read

00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:25,130
my around which one is easier to use

00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:33,540
human disease meteors you leaving only

00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:36,990
thing there's its community oh there's

00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:40,530
Hugh that as he can to win run on server

00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:43,650
and client it's doing blowj of the same

00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:46,350
things but it was just one package and

00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:49,800
it made it very very cinnamony really

00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:52,650
use so really the punishing it isn't is

00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,380
really impossible we know that it is

00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:57,930
people who are doing it right now there

00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,110
are there are clearly realized ribbon

00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:03,900
and in my bonnet are all we know there

00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:06,570
the provision ability is easy we live in

00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:09,390
a way that's accessible is it as easy to

00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:12,600
run real time as it is to write a

00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:19,290
traditional national one the answer

00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:21,270
unfortunately I'm is that when you watch

00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:26,400
the video streaming hat i do hope the

00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:30,270
whole think it's really cool join Fatah

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,880
so long lab I mean this is what the

00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:34,980
future looks like I'm not committed it

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,230
will be easier as i said but i'm

00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:40,650
convinced at from a user standpoint real

00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:43,859
time is where we're going and as Python

00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:45,890
developers genuine with my owner as

00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:49,920
pipeline developers we have two choices

00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:54,260
we can adapt to this new world or we can

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,260
all be swallowed by other language

00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:11,530
of course it's become hard because

00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:15,910
concurrently an icon is a minefield what

00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:20,050
you with the concurrency is my problem

00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:24,190
you just run a bunch of processes or

00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:28,180
gonna porn boxes you still hotly among

00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:31,240
sirs and you may get you do currency

00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:34,540
outside it's really kinda not a problem

00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:37,210
but when you start using real-time web

00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:40,630
to see the pachitea equation confirming

00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:42,880
to get a lot of requires holding over

00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:46,690
than a persistent in connection from

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,740
your server to every single other every

00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:54,400
single currently connected web browser

00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:57,340
somebody asked me yesterday how load

00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:02,160
balancers ulettus and I started laughing

00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,160
because the answer is not well at all

00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:09,940
there isn't we can't really say when it

00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:13,090
comes to real time oh this is this is a

00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:16,300
hash problem unfortunately we're going

00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:20,880
to build behind in Python I think it's

00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:24,100
probably Python problem or are are

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,930
referring North tunnel the fact is that

00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:31,540
we're heading into a world of multi-core

00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:34,390
you know CDU improvement in terms of

00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:36,130
ross CD / CD you basically hot we

00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:38,950
haven't seen a lot of you know what the

00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:42,250
CDU you yet today I still sort of sat

00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:43,900
out that the 40 acres right and we were

00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,990
able to buy you know three and a half

00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:49,920
your cpu's like five years ago like be

00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:52,870
heaven we have a really interesting man

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,680
there are people don't understand I

00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:58,480
think it has to do with the highs so

00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,120
what happened instead is were in rather

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:07,060
than making cds faster we're making the

00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:09,790
more concurrent this is a horrible now

00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,369
but I don't want to give a credit on sun

00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:15,960
latest architecture

00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:20,670
this party before there are eight there

00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:23,039
are eight cores on each die you want to

00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:25,829
be easy it is a CD you are so there's

00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:28,440
eight cores on a single ship and each of

00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:31,650
those chips exposes is a hard bed rest

00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:34,619
so this is 64 or CPUs in fact in a

00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:38,309
singing old tiny little die right this

00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:41,490
is a 60-40 use on a ship and in one rack

00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:43,109
mount unit you can cram for those CD is

00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,420
how about they cool is the thing I have

00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:49,579
no idea you can cram for were those into

00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:54,529
a single box between one you you can get

00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:54,529
256 hard on a single machine

00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:01,339
unfortunately most of our software only

00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:04,950
take advantage of one thread at once

00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:08,249
this is a shot of a sick a keen for

00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:15,089
running clothes shop good thinking about

00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:17,660
60 cards right and including really the

00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:22,019
only get an adjustable for art right

00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:23,849
you've heard of that set apart of it but

00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:26,249
there's more to it than that it is that

00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:28,739
our current reading primitives have

00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:33,450
trouble dealing with multi former world

00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:35,670
in a way it is in the club in its very

00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:38,069
hard hurt I'm gonna fry dissolve are

00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:41,910
necessarily bad they're hard for program

00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:49,380
I understand that's pretty well and I

00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:56,150
still a lot of options in Python forever

00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:58,079
tornado side I had to stop a lot like

00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:59,640
everyone looks like you didn't have on

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,499
there someone would say what about

00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:05,089
because there's a fun on a really good

00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:08,099
options unfortunately none of these

00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:11,190
nothing is really kind of fit together

00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:18,630
very well they're not we don't have a

00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:22,109
here in answer to two multi positive if

00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:25,440
you choose tornado for your concurrency

00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:28,349
and I've chosen gmn we probably can't

00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,839
run on our top we're in the same process

00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:36,680
we probably can't use our tools together

00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:38,760
what kind of sauce and and you know

00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:43,470
there's a lot of work to do the same

00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:46,260
right this is a concurrency there's a

00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:48,720
lot of much much harder people need

00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:52,220
we're going to stop if you want to know

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:58,010
more about sort of the concurrency a

00:47:52,220 --> 00:48:03,079
little models for it had long-term

00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:07,770
contracts reading on the pad is written

00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:10,710
and I don't have a point here i'm smart

00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:14,339
up I don't actually understand well so

00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:17,310
really need help right we needed a

00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:19,920
better answer here it's not going to

00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:22,369
come from me maybe they don't have a

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,369
moment of you

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,920
okay so by the way conclusion I want to

00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:40,549
divide imagine a little side in 2020

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:43,369
this is not an entire hour 38 2020 is

00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:48,410
final call for html5 so it was a

00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:55,339
supposedly today I will be on come on

00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:58,339
think but in theory 2020 is supported by

00:48:55,339 --> 00:49:02,960
all my brothers remember the homies sort

00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:07,990
of happen all too often you know like

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:10,309
when i kidded a gecko and whatever so um

00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:12,619
this is probably when we able to

00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:18,460
actually count on to stop being like

00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:21,890
mature and stable possibly for people

00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:25,549
thinking about as like what generation

00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:29,000
it is it is really fully here right when

00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:33,549
we're when we think about inserted 2012

00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,910
as sort of backwards you know it

00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:40,670
together with stones um so I don't know

00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:42,710
you and I wanna be losing I see no

00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,329
reason why I should be using on in

00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:51,559
twenty eight twenty really know what I

00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:54,680
don't have to use a script i'm not i'm

00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:57,589
not sure the Jade any tool that can take

00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:00,200
us on a decade in the future it may be

00:49:57,589 --> 00:50:02,720
at our current problem i play or simply

00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,400
can't adapt i may in fact be talking

00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,740
about next generation about I pretty

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:11,269
much maybe just one fire when you use to

00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:15,559
make it course I wanted this TJ and make

00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:18,259
sure if it is but it's finally at

00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:20,869
something else as long as the Python the

00:50:18,259 --> 00:50:23,539
thing is you know as old as good as

00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:32,289
operating a ten years so we're behind

00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:32,289
those we gotta get moving thank you

00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:51,339
I can take questions already a couple of

00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:53,019
minutes Saturday and this is my

00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:57,599
microphone you can ask your question in

00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:57,599
the nicest people in here anyone

00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:07,749
anything you can if you could see slowly

00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:09,369
there's a lot of here so I'm actually to

00:51:07,749 --> 00:51:11,529
the context of what are you talkin an

00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:14,799
end concurrency and me needing

00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:19,240
improbable conductor inflatables all of

00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:22,720
you on the necessary of immune by a

00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:30,910
traditional beautiful beautiful

00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:36,990
beautiful general immunity okay but if

00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:42,519
you want i didn't i would be immutable

00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:46,660
but you react another way is all crazy

00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:48,730
and from so just follow my basically

00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:53,109
making everything immutable or humor

00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:55,299
laying here and I there's no way we

00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:58,380
should be two monumental change you know

00:51:55,299 --> 00:52:00,400
I might even icon for what do that

00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:06,249
anyone would talk about it on for a

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:08,499
nomad yeah I mean only one answer I'm

00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:14,400
really intrigued by the work that our

00:52:08,499 --> 00:52:18,299
media was doing on sth memory in in high

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:22,239
because I think media that seems to be

00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:25,119
defeating the most Python exclusion

00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:29,019
because it basically is not mutilators

00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:31,150
it's like optimistically you get to make

00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:34,150
a change and you only have a certain a

00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:36,999
copy of something goes wrong so you know

00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:40,660
as a new I think that seemed like the

00:52:36,999 --> 00:52:43,539
best from you know 80 that we need sort

00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:47,410
of immutable primitive language and I

00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:48,940
don't really know I think that it is it

00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,450
over to leave immediately go to

00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,460
sealingly great ideas

00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:56,030
which is so hopefully there's someone

00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:59,359
out there doing research on what do we

00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:03,560
know about this earlier that and you

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:06,050
know we can pull it off like iconic

00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:08,920
solution so that I don't want to think

00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,920
about when I look at

00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:32,509
hi there is a slight deterioration

00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:38,019
anything for its real-time happening

00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:50,329
using wsj the jungles response a good

00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:55,249
thing is the socket rely on these eh eh

00:53:50,329 --> 00:54:00,140
come on you right it's just a suitable

00:53:55,249 --> 00:54:04,309
for practice where I start out HTTP and

00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:08,029
then like friction is too so what I

00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:11,619
think is your night you know it's just

00:54:08,029 --> 00:54:15,380
gonna freak out that's why that's why

00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:20,509
I've example it's actually detecting an

00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:24,640
eye open and switching over to different

00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:28,369
service that it's not that it's not so

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:32,900
effectively mean little proxy to swap

00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:39,009
between traditional HTTP and I'm good

00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:39,009
where I know the solution is yeah

00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:49,690
I think that's probably where they need

00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:54,099
to go you know pipe pipe network in

00:54:49,690 --> 00:55:03,009
addition probably needs to be work as a

00:54:54,099 --> 00:55:21,789
snack a little while thank you up in

00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:25,239
here hi my name is a mission are you

00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:27,789
looking at a sort of change ourselves so

00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:31,390
that we can actually be named a suspect

00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:37,259
or do we order to lose to decorate it

00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:37,259
along the way we only need about a butt

00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:47,799
rash so I'm doing any changes we made

00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:51,459
any court an amorous or how are we

00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:53,589
looking at the whole planet right so I I

00:55:51,459 --> 00:56:00,039
should be clear that I don't get at the

00:55:53,589 --> 00:56:01,959
time one of 30 ish committers and one of

00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:06,690
thousands of community members and we

00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:10,900
don't know one rules unilaterally I have

00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:12,369
ideas but I'm hoping that at the

00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:15,459
community you know all of what the

00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:18,009
community wants so that I've said this

00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:22,170
is that ok man over the pond would be

00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:24,910
held about I don't wanna go and

00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:26,729
100-meter creators actually a keynote at

00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:29,829
Genetron and there was a ton of

00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:32,259
discussion about real-time web and there

00:56:29,829 --> 00:56:35,440
seems to be a growing consensus pretty

00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:37,269
strong among most users that yeah there

00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,839
should be four changes to the framework

00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:44,499
itself that j.lo can can sort of pushing

00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:48,250
along in this direction you know adrian

00:56:44,499 --> 00:56:51,340
is the point that even a creator take

00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:55,360
made the point that not every not every

00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:58,030
website it is a chatot knees like really

00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,160
awesome baking an amazing real-time

00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:01,630
currency but a lot about that I can

00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,630
benefit kind of from a little bit of it

00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:07,300
and we could probably do a really good

00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:09,280
job delivering on that again that like

00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:13,120
sweet shop at presented it most people

00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:15,340
use and you know I don't see any reason

00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,770
why we can't put that in the frame and I

00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:19,990
think I see a huge number of manifest we

00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:22,480
can come back to man is not high on a

00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:26,290
server again and just everything kind of

00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,120
magically worsley I think we can I think

00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:30,610
you know Jamie over two years could

00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,350
compete favourably with you know meteor

00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:44,700
on the lines of code a number of

00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:44,700
dependencies you go metrics and also i

00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:53,290
think that apps are more suited than

00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:57,960
browsers so what I reviews on how Dan

00:57:53,290 --> 00:58:03,160
can work better with a pie in real time

00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:08,110
en la world and and your general out

00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:11,710
blogger of the web what is Absalom or

00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:14,440
off web so sorry talking about sort of

00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:17,100
the distinction between a web you know

00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,620
web application built using HTML

00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:26,200
technologies like a lot or something

00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:28,360
yeah yeah I mean so I actually consider

00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,810
like I consider gonna have to be badass

00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:33,400
they're they're built the funimation mr.

00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:35,890
but they're talking over the web to

00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:39,250
Magadan web services and and as far as

00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:41,050
I'm concerned like provide a boy with

00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:44,550
jayla dollars flowing to the bike and if

00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,550
I my dog bones pile on

00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:52,770
like I think that we're not going to

00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:55,260
talk on that it's just not happening so

00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:57,120
we can't expect you know we can connect

00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,310
the phone mental anguish necessarily to

00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,290
be Python but I think we can save your

00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:05,100
claim to that and we can say we're going

00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:07,950
to be absolute best on back into the

00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:10,380
real time when challenges and we have to

00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:12,810
start we have to track you can come on

00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:15,120
the front end it's not it's not useful

00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:17,220
to people that we say hey Dave all the

00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:19,260
stuff now you have to learn backbone we

00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,930
need to abstract make it easier for them

00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,160
but i do think that we can actually kind

00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,990
of live in a world where it does really

00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,490
matter what people are doing on the

00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:31,040
