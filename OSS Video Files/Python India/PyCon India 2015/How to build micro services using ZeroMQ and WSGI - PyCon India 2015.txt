Publication date: 2015-10-12
Playlist: PyCon India 2015
Description: 
	Speaker: Srinath G S

Zwsgi, a ZeroMQ to WSGI bridge that gives your existing WSGI applications the power of the rich ZeroMQ messaging library.

I will elaborate using a simple use case, that defines a reliable service-oriented request-reply dialog between a set of client applications, a broker and a set of worker applications.
