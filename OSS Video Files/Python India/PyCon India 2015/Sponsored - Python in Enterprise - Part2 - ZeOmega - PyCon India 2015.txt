00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:12,090
this Z Omega presentation here my topic

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:14,610
is web application deployment so with

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,880
this short time I am going to cover very

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:24,080
few fundamental things that you can

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,150
watch out or you know you can learn

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,699
about this application deployment i do

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,610
not think i can cover all the aspects

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,770
how you can what are the things that in

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,260
very detail okay with this short span of

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,600
time i will just give a very high level

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,700
overview of some of the things that is

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,460
required for web application deployment

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,440
so how many of you are working on web

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,760
application development or deployment or

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,510
things like just I want to see how many

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,360
of you okay I hope and how many of you

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,289
are working on this mobile applications

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,359
or anything like that anybody right so

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,680
even if it is mobile application see

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,090
most of the technology in the web

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,729
servers i am talking about the

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,000
server-side deployment so that means it

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,710
is same right whether it is whether you

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,229
are using web application or mobile

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,330
applications or maybe some other so it's

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,299
all ultimately it's a server said it

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,150
does have much difference okay so we

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,740
will see few things okay i haven't

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,710
mentioned my name my name is wise you

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:31,799
work 40 mega as an architect so first

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,659
thing you just you require to deploy a

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,210
website or web application is the domain

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,850
registration thereof l these are a few

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,490
tips that you how many of you on your

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,770
own website or you purchased domain for

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,710
your applications just can you raise

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,280
your hands okay okay so some of the

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,170
things that you can you know helpful is

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,850
it domains what do you any purchase it

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,820
should be something memorable that easy

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,469
to type short avoid numbers and hyphens

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,930
because it is not easy to type from

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,360
mobile sender and choose appropriate

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,649
tlds top-level domains like calm but

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,869
this stays it is very difficult to get

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:14,280
dot-com and so maybe you can go for dot

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:16,470
io okay and and one a site or

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,390
not told that you can use to check

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,250
whether your domain is properly

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,750
registered or you know whether that X

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,959
paradise it is who is okay how many of

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,450
you tried this who is side here before

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,459
when you go and before you purchasing

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,530
any domain or something you can go and

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,870
check this who is record so who is

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,140
record is something like an official

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,150
record of you know a particular domain

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,340
right when you purchase a domain so you

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,010
are the owner so who will give that

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,400
information so there are some websites

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:54,150
like who dot is or who dot godaddy.com

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,980
or even you can use the Linux command

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,130
called who is which is going to Corey

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,650
that registry and show this information

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,300
about when this site is that is going to

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,959
show the who is the owner who is address

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,819
to contact for the domain and then

00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,890
details like that okay so that is going

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,360
to very useful and especially the expiry

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,180
date is very important you should ensure

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,709
that your site is not going to exper you

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,600
know suddenly one day and you know your

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,510
site is vanishing and somebody else may

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,540
purchase that may make problem so next

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,780
thing that you need to record is the DNS

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,370
management so I mean the domain once you

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,670
purchase domain and you are one or you

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,829
need to use some dns server so that you

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,970
can specific various your back-end

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:41,790
service server is located and then all

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,489
those that there are various types of

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,970
DNS records so those all things you can

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,970
manage using this DNS service and the

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,370
commercial or very popular ones are

00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:56,070
amazon route 53 you can use that route

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,739
53 to manage your DNS or you can use

00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:02,070
there are some other things service like

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,840
Diane DNS there is some free dns servers

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,150
if you purchase your domain through

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,980
godaddy maybe you can use the godaddy

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,769
dns service but if you really want to

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,200
scale very for a very large better to go

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,329
for this kind of external services ok

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,359
and the cloud fergie also gives some

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:20,789
kind of free dns which is really good so

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,930
i am going to give this kind of very

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:27,030
high level points ok going for next

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,050
slides so if you are high any questions

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,120
you can interrupt me

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,069
I hope I can take up the questions one

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,509
or two questions and try to explain more

00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:38,669
about that okay so in the DNS again

00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,259
there are few types of records that is

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:42,629
very important I just list out few

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,210
things that is a address record see name

00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,729
that is canonical name records and MX

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,280
mail exchange records and text txt

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:52,229
records okay so we will see few what are

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:58,139
the things so error code is something

00:04:52,229 --> 00:05:00,629
that a 32-bit IP version address so this

00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,340
is one way you can directly specific

00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,650
that your domain is pointing to a

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,169
particular machine so if you using let

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,909
us say digital ocean or Amazon Web said

00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,159
they provide IP address in the case of

00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,810
Amazon there is a something called

00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:14,940
elastic IP that will be a public IP

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,849
address so we can use that public IP

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,949
address as the error code value so that

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:21,659
means whenever I request is somebody's

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,240
trying to access the domain this is the

00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:25,860
IP that is going to get resolved ok so

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
this record is that and the way to

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,080
verify that you can use the command dig

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,330
dig command you can use whatever tools i

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,789
will apt or m and you can install the

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,880
dick command and then run like this big

00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:40,529
iphone te a is the type name of the type

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,750
of the record and then specify the

00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:46,409
domain and is going to show this where

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,120
this domain is pointing to right so here

00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:49,919
i am giving an example if you type this

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,840
command D kifer nearby the node or you

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,090
can see that is pointing to one IP

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,789
address so that is where this Python

00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:00,060
server is located now the next type our

00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:02,250
code is cname that is a alias record so

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,139
that means for any type of record you

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:23,690
can give an alias so normally people use

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:27,029
like www.captionassociates.com only used

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,949
then MX record is again very important I

00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,830
just showed that MX records for Z Omega

00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:35,479
comp so maybe from this itself we can

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:38,669
see that we are using google apps for

00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:40,949
you know or us or MTN mail that means

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:44,279
all males are going to google apps right

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:48,719
so this record is helping to manage a

00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,399
specific what are my you know the smtp

00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,409
mail males are reaching where it is

00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,599
going to reach out so this MX records

00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:56,250
there are priorities there is a column

00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,710
called that the last second last one

00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,770
that 10 15 so first priorities for that

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,020
AP SP MX dot one dot google.com things

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,779
like that so this is so that means in

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,330
case if you going to use google apps or

00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,009
maybe some other service so this is the

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,940
record type that you need to modify an

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:16,979
update to receive mails okay and txt

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,120
record is another generator code is a

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:23,250
general arbitrary human readable text

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,159
record but later it was it is also used

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,659
for enforcing some other security

00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:33,240
mechanisms like SPF dkm for melee force

00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:36,270
protecting the males and you know to

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,949
avoid this pam Sandahl so and is also

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,810
sometimes it is used for verifying your

00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,699
domain so in case if you are using some

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,729
services like Google Apps and all they

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:47,190
ask you out they asked you to add the

00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:50,069
text record so that your can say that

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,649
this domain is owned by me because this

00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,449
all the records are adding by yourself

00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:57,120
so if some other service you are relying

00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,800
on you need to prove that you have the

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,930
owner right so we can use this kind of

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,089
txt records for that also okay

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,270
multi-purpose things so let us move on

00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:09,599
so what are the possible hosting over so

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:12,000
we seen that you know first you need to

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,000
get a domain and then you need a dns

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,649
manager you can use free one or

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,569
commercial I mean paid ones and the next

00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:20,339
thing is you need some birth to host

00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:22,349
this application there are lot of places

00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:24,270
available now if you want to host your

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:25,620
applications the first listed one

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,810
digital ocean by the way I am not really

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,310
promoting any of this thing you can it

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,440
is up to you to decide based on its

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,750
criteria decision anyway I've found it's

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,760
very symbol for very simple applications

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,190
but when if you really want to go very

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,750
highly scalable product everything I do

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,740
not think it meets all the requirements

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:46,920
okay then better choices would be like

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,930
Amazon AWS Amazon Cloud or google cloud

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,640
or Microsoft cloud or racks for things

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,230
like that okay anyway I am not spending

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,020
much time the next technology that is

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,180
record for is for

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,190
managing your application is a load

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,170
balancer in this case again there are

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,850
lot of choices available even

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,530
commissioned one I wish I had mentioned

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,660
for example if you are using Amazon Web

00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,520
Services you can use their cloud front

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,040
service that is one choice or if you are

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,960
building your own load balancer somebody

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,080
was asking earlier that what is a load

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,270
balancer in fact there is a module in a

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,510
posh a which i haven't mentioned here

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,210
that is called mod proxy balancer that

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:27,930
is what we are using as a load balancer

00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:30,060
for the zeba okay in this case there are

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,610
other options possible or this ng neck

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,460
which is a very good and H a proxy is a

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,350
process genric load balancer I mean it

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:43,110
can handle any kind of TCP that means

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:45,180
that includes HTTP also right so so I

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,910
will just show you a typical confession

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,550
how an engine X confession looks like

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:53,700
for a if you want to balance lot of

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,370
servers I would suggest to go for engine

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,360
X if you are starting with the new

00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,850
deployment and if you want to balance

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,160
lot of application servers which is very

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,530
light to it and even now they have a

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,530
commercial support also in case if you

00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:10,680
want to scale to that extent ok so this

00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,570
engine X even a partial Civic pattern

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,160
would be same you just specify what are

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,020
your back-end server so you can see can

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,840
see in this slide I am missing the

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:22,020
upstream the tag under that this is my

00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,640
domain AP a dot example.com and then

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,770
within that in this case I only

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,710
mentioned server one local IP and port

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,260
number but you can specify port numbers

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,080
or different different IP address so

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,580
that way all this service will by the

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,680
way by default it will take a one

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,870
default algorithm but it they provide

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,450
different different algorithm for you

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,720
know managing this back-end services

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,060
okay and then if you are using a you

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,210
know ssl against pacy the listening port

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,280
and then the ssl I mean certificates of

00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,800
information and then one crucial thing

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,530
about this one is this the if you want

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,860
capturing the real IP you can use this

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:03,690
set header XTL IP so that means you can

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,180
somebody was asking earlier that how do

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,740
we restrict based on the that was

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,540
question is not really about

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,030
thing maybe from if you want to

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,800
prioritize based on things or if you

00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,150
want to do throttling based on if you

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,160
want to mitigate some kind of dos

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,380
attacks things like that this kind of

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,390
capturing information would be really

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,200
important so that your back and server

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,760
can see those information sometimes some

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,280
information will be get hidden for

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,230
example in this case if X real IP is

00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,190
missing that means always your back-end

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,690
server will see that 127 opens that from

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,580
all the request is coming from the local

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,120
host which is not true so in those cases

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,470
you can use this kind of additional

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,120
settings addition headers and then you

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,890
can rely on that from your back-end

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,170
service to know from where this request

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,570
is originating ok the same thing should

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,130
be possible for you know other

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,630
techniques like if you want to

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,280
understand whether the request is coming

00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,230
from your mobile front end or maybe

00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,120
which is coming from so maybe one

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,950
technique could be like you can have an

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,680
additional header set from your iOS

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,660
another header from Android ener from

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,490
the web client so this way now you will

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,130
come to know which is what--right and

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,410
also you can provide other rate limiting

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,270
so that way I mean all these things are

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,790
possible that means there are lot of

00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,770
work involved in that to do to

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,870
throttling things like that ok then move

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,090
forward so that is that means your load

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:26,790
balancer is at keep technology that you

00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,500
need to be aware of to do a proper web

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,840
application deployment of course neither

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,970
ssl certificate is a very important this

00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,000
stays if you are deploying any website

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,460
and all you know that is something it

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,650
helps a very many various ways to you

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,300
know if you are our application is more

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,520
like a content management systems and

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,860
you you want to be more your page

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,360
ranking should grow more you know SSL

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,950
would be a better you know Google will

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,410
respect the decision and increase your

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,450
page ranking if you I mean imagine that

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,580
aside without HTTPS and with a chitet be

00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,550
so HTTP a site will get more better page

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,860
ranking ok in other ways it is helping

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,470
you to secure this side and again

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,960
purchasing domains you need to either

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,250
you can we use godaddy dizzy sir there

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,480
are so many these are the two popular

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,550
ones and there are so many other sources

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,100
and there is something coming up by next

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,500
month that is called let's encrypt or

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,840
maybe you cannot do that so that in case

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,180
if you want to buy a free ssl

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,690
certificate that is initiative from

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,970
Mozilla and

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,850
any other organizations so to make all

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,770
the sides ssl you know throw is so that

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:33,300
means you can I will get a free ssl

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:35,100
through let's encrypt org okay they will

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,150
be launching it by next month that is my

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,860
understanding then other things other

00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,960
few or technology that you need to be

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,790
aware of that content delivery networks

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,320
for web application especially or not

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,390
only web applications if you are a lot

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,810
of media content or you know things like

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,640
JavaScript CSS or phones you know it is

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,810
not a good idea to always make your

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,370
application server you know exposing or

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,260
you know receiving this the request and

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,370
then serving that content right so it is

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,370
not really required because those

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,990
contents may not but if any are using CD

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,190
and again there are so many other things

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,470
that you need to take care especially

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,660
about the expiry time so that it is not

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,210
going to be cached locally and it's not

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,000
going to serve the old content anyway so

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,530
this there are some so one of the other

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,300
advantage with the recipients are that

00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,950
it's going to reduce your latency that

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,900
means depending on the geo frequent

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,160
geographical location where you look at

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,620
the content will be served from that

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,850
that means in somebody from Korea if is

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,150
accessing the content will be served

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,950
from nearby Korea server or if somewhere

00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,750
from Africa that content will be served

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,780
from Africa like that that means if your

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,430
application is globally distributed but

00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,990
in our organization we do not have that

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,720
much distribution so we do not use any

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,100
external CD and as of now but this would

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,140
be some one of the thing that you need

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,330
to be aware when you are deploying your

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,940
above applications of course you need

00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:56,070
some support in from your back-end it is

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,660
not just a deployments all these

00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,520
providers what I am discussing about is

00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,480
not just a deployment from this your

00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,190
application should be designed

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,930
architected in such a way that it

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,450
supports all this kind of features okay

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:10,920
especially with the CDN and all see in

00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:13,380
the previous slide i have used see this

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,410
NZ next conversation i used a PA dot

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,480
example.com right so that means if you

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:22,560
are there is a restriction that is your

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,060
your axle request cannot if any scripts

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,560
cannot make a request to some other

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,270
server by default through because of

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,830
security so that means and if your

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:32,250
content is serving from something like

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,960
static dot some dot com site that will

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,279
not be available one we there will be

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,720
the security decision so

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,819
to avoid that you need to use some other

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,639
standards like course in that case

00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:43,499
cross-origin request I forgot exit full

00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,810
name okay so in that case you need more

00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:47,600
work in the application side also so it

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,829
is not just a deployment problem alone

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,720
however I just men keep mentioning all

00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:53,519
this kind of things so that you can

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,160
watch out for this kind of things when

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,449
you are handling deployment even if it

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,550
is a small application or large-scale

00:15:57,449 --> 00:16:00,899
applications okay so what are the other

00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,180
major things that you require of the

00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,680
Confederation manage is a big thing as

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,649
your application is growing it be having

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,110
lot of confession to take care manage so

00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:12,600
in Python based tools are there

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,920
available things like salt to stack and

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,499
support I think there are some talk

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:21,300
going on about those things or times of

00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:23,009
okay sorry lens break okay I think I

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,050
will stop right now because I think I

00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:27,629
cannot continue with this there are few

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,050
other couple more slides which is was

00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:32,129
going to mentioning about few other

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,470
technologies that is going to be useful

00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:35,999
for you know publication to plan so what

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,970
you can do is that you can come to our

00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:40,050
store and Z Omega I will be there and if

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,959
you are interested to learn more about

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,430
this bio I am working as a DevOps I mean

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,980
development operations handing so that

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,430
means i can answer more questions how we

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,569
can you know do deployment web

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:56,540
application diploma i'll be very happy

00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:56,540
