00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:21,449
last year just a second this is the

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:24,720
mouse ok so i launched the website last

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,599
year at PyCon somebody's gonna help me

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,060
out so it started off as a personalized

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,369
newsletter for the Python community one

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,360
that is not just the summary of the

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,710
whole reddit Python subreddit and just

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,570
want to give a status update on what's

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,309
really happening and kind of take

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,760
community feedback on what can be done

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,649
more so the newsletter has gone from

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,180
subscription all the way from zero last

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,539
year when i launched to close to nine

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,120
thousand two hundred and besides that

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,579
there is a free python job board so if

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,739
any of you are any of your company is

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,629

and will be featured in the newsletter

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:08,430
besides that i want to basically talk

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,100
about what you know i am planning to do

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,560
next so all this while i was curating

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,479
the newsletter and i would get feedback

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,430
from people saying that hey can you

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,860
include more of flask articles and not

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,450
chango and you know people from when i

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,310
would share data science and machine

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,750
learning articles people would come back

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,000
and say hey I wrote this pretty cool

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,130
article can you read it and include it

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,100
in your newsletter I kind of realized

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,159
that a I am just one person be I I do

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,180
not know the whole spectrum of Python

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,290
you know whether it's data science

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,439
machine learning I'm not the right

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,390
person to curate it so I talked a couple

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,759
of people in the community and one good

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,450
idea was to open up the curation and

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,220
allow other people to curate the

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,409
newsletter so I just want to show

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,329
quickly how I curate the newsletter and

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,030
I would love to hear what you guys have

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,689
to say about it so all the articles that

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,689
you see every week that is coming up in

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,979
the newsletter are basically

00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,869
automatically automated in the sense

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,360
that they are they are crawl and they

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:13,270
are indexed in the software and it is

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,220
indexed by you know the recent ones

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,840
so so basically the newsletter focuses

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,240
on the fresh articles for the last seven

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,100
days so you can basically go through the

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,850
articles and if you like some title

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,850
click on it say for example how you use

00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:30,990
get using ipython notebook and you can

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:37,960
basically you know write the summary and

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:40,630
go and add it to the latest you know the

00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,000
newsletter count so the agenda of me

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,940
being here is to kind of just put this

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,800
out saying that the idea is to open up

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,630
the curation to the public and I would

00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:55,630
love to get your feedback on CS at

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,670
import patten.com and the idea is to

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,490
invite one person from the community

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:04,270
every week to come and curate the

00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:06,040
newsletter for the public and yep and

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,750
the final marketing pitch would be

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,750
