Title: Building NextGen IoT solutions using Python and Cloud - PyCon India 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-11
Playlist: PyCon India 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: Abhishek Narain & Saurabh

In this topic, we will use Raspberry Pi B+ running Linux and leverage the power of Python to push the sensor/ IoT data on to the Cloud from various sensors (Temperature, Ultrasonic, and Light Sensors - in practical scenarios, the same can be extended to millions of devices). The bigger challenge resides in successfully and securely collecting and analyzing the data from millions of devices in real-time. For this, we will leverage the Cloud power- Azure to do a real-time analytics. Hence, we will discuss on the various IoT Architectures. In our demo, we will use the Gateway Architecture, connecting Arduino to Raspberry Pi/ Galileo which in turn will setup a secure Data communication with the cloud.
