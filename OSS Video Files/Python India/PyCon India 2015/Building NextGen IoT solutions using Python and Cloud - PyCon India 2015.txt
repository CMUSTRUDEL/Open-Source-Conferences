Title: Building NextGen IoT solutions using Python and Cloud - PyCon India 2015
Publication date: 2015-10-11
Playlist: PyCon India 2015
Description: 
	Speakers: Abhishek Narain & Saurabh

In this topic, we will use Raspberry Pi B+ running Linux and leverage the power of Python to push the sensor/ IoT data on to the Cloud from various sensors (Temperature, Ultrasonic, and Light Sensors - in practical scenarios, the same can be extended to millions of devices). The bigger challenge resides in successfully and securely collecting and analyzing the data from millions of devices in real-time. For this, we will leverage the Cloud power- Azure to do a real-time analytics. Hence, we will discuss on the various IoT Architectures. In our demo, we will use the Gateway Architecture, connecting Arduino to Raspberry Pi/ Galileo which in turn will setup a secure Data communication with the cloud.

so next talk we have building next-gen

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,839
IOT solutions using Python in cloud the

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,269
speaker for today

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,110
the stock is Abhishek Narayan and sort

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,429
of up chase up shake is a Technical

00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,529
Evangelist and has worked as a

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,660
consultant for Microsoft and in folk

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,220
districts so Rob is a Technical

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,439
Evangelist and has worked on

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,939
technologies such as Azure a game

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,449
development and client web development

00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:30,289
good morning

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,030
I mean there's a lot of people I

00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,219
expected a little more good morning

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,710
everyone

00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:40,290
ok great to see this crowd it's pre

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,950
awesome and we'll try to keep up to your

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,230
expectations as well and as you see this

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,329
talk is mostly about Internet of Things

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,989
so just a quick hands up how many of you

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:56,430
have you tried with embedded programming

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:59,010
or Internet of Things programming Wow

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,510
and how many of you were there yesterday

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,930
in the workshop ok cool yep you were

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,270
there

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,400
so in today's talk what we'll do is

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,130
we'll talk about Internet of Things the

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,110
whole scenario first and then we'll take

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,299
you through some interesting demos on on

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,560
raspberry pi is already knows and you

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,869
know play around with those things and

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,020
it's gonna be pretty basic and we'll use

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,360
of course the language of the day which

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,159
is Python and how many of you just to

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,509
understand how many of you also work on

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,820
no Jas pretty good ok I can do something

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,829
of a small server creation there as well

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,710
and then you guys should be able to

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,180
bring that and then query few stuff so

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:44,850
we'll do those crazy stuff based on the

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:47,250
time that we have so in terms of things

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,990
is nothing but physical objects you know

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,399
network of physical objects that contain

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,290
embedded technology this was already

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,570
already there people were using embedded

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,909
all the time now with the better

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,130
connectivity we are able to connect

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,280
these all together pass the data

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,869
somewhere and then do more meaningful

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,469
analytics on top of that so this whole

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:10,610
scenario is basically what people call

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,610
that as Internet of Things

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,050
okay and core for core aspects why

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,750
Internet of Things is not just about

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:24,240
doing a blinky on Raspberry Pi - it's

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,760
because we got to think about yes from

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,310
the devices standpoint and there's a lot

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,630
of things like security of the data

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,240
because when we talk about internal

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,090
things we are actually for instance

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,550
reading a home sensor data value and

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,130
putting it somewhere for analytics and

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,520
then this communication from this small

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,680
device to somewhere else needs to be

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,160
secured because your data is at stake

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,800
now a lot of things privacy concerns can

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,350
come up over there so connectivity is a

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,910
key important area in it nothing so

00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,920
she'll talk about and then of course

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,430
analytics the whole idea of in terms of

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,770
things is so that you can embedded

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,390
devices were there already we can get

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,090
some value out of those embedded devices

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,840
and then figure out some patterns based

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,670
on you know ml machine learning and then

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,769
we can do some predictive analytics or

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,420
which can help business do better right

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,090
so that's like the core idea what our

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,470
enterprise would think about so we'll

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,810
talk about analytics as well so these

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,540
are the four key tenets which covers the

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,110
Internet of Things and some stats about

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:37,860
Internet of Things 50 billion devices in

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:40,320
numbers by 2020 start with about 50

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,790
billion now it's up to 2 1 2 billion and

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:47,430
the market for that so the facts to

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,100
actually see why Internet of Things is a

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,019
positive now and there are multiple

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,510
examples of sujood associated to that so

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,850
you even you all of you would have heard

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,340
of something or the other example of

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,350
Agriculture where you can remotely

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,610
control the farm from your place when

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,350
you sitting somewhere else and you can

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,420
see whether you want to actually water

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,060
that farm or not and you can actually

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,130
turn on the tap based on based on that

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,870
sensor data as well there are multiple

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,050
examples of that we see some more as we

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,730
go on

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:22,340
yep and this is some example of you know

00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,470
how we can compute how Internet of

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,620
Things can really help us save money

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,030
this one example in commercial aviation

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,400
industry Oh

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,500
one person of fuel consumption if you

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,810
save that one person one person isn't

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,210
that much but somehow by automation or

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,150
whatever if we can kind of optimize that

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:44,660
it gives us savings over 30 billion

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,550
dollars over 15 years which is a huge

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,260
number thirty billion dollars is a huge

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,030
amount right similarly for other

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,100
industries will just quickly through

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,590
this for energy and gas industry one

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,070
person plant efficiency gain equates to

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,690
like sixty six billion dollars this for

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,940
health care sixty three billion dollars

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,970
similarly for freight transport railways

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,950
and so on oil and gas 90 billion dollars

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,140
so there's a lot of money here why

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,360
enterprises are pushing towards Internet

00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,240
of Things these days and this is why we

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,190
are talking here so that all of us can

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,380
actually focus on in terms of things and

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,570
then get started with building solutions

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,160
on top of it right and this is Gartner

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,230
hype cycle so what do you see on the top

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:31,210
is Internet of Things very difficult see

00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:34,190
from that fire control one works so

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,290
right so this is Internet of Things

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,690
which is like on the hype cycle top of

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:42,130
it from this is the Gartner's hype cycle

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:44,540
so most hyped technology right now and

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,400
no wonder why you know we should be

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,840
thinking about or we should be good at

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,070
Internet of Things because it really

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:56,090
helps us in the future and then we'll

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:58,280
talk about these industries so these are

00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,720
those common use case scenarios of

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,860
different industries how they are using

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,280
Internet of Things we have a few

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,050
customers we can talk about we won't we

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,480
have one which we are working with

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,480
closely a company called Tyson Crowe

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:18,400
they make

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:20,229
and all those things so even hello yeah

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,900
so I need to be closer to the mic side

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:26,560
so it's a company which makes escalators

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,780
elevators and they're partnering with us

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,030
to basically figure out when do you want

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,379
to actually maintain scheduled

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,030
maintenance for the elevator

00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,770
so considered they have put up some

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,229
sensors which can actually detect that

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,940
say two weeks down the line this

00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:43,389
elevator will need some repair and

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,879
before anything fatal happens or before

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,620
actually something manual happens and

00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,130
the technician comes and takes care of

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,810
that

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,360
they're able to predict that beforehand

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,530
and they and they use machine learning

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,110
and all those things at the back end to

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,970
just figure out some data or figure out

00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,620
some meaning out of that and take some

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,180
action based on that so that's a live

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,039
example we have multiple based on that

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,599
as well we have smart building homes yep

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,139
so how many of you are wearing a

00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:11,440
variable band smart band smartwatches

00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:13,629
we're fit built burn okay so I mean

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,590
that's one space where you know people

00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:19,449
think next like the mobile boom is going

00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,340
to move towards that variables and so on

00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,169
with those technologies and that is

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,180
where IOT comes in straight away for

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,370
consumers right variables is nothing but

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,400
integral things stuff for consumers

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,259
that's one example no the other stuff is

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,539
one of the enterprise ones because

00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:37,380
there's more money there one of the

00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:39,849
bigger one of the biggest diesel engine

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,819
manufacturers in this world they have

00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:44,800
used one solution which I know of they

00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:47,949
have their microcontrollers there in the

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,430
engine they have used various sensors in

00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:56,319
it which gives our values back to the to

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:58,900
the mobile app using your Bluetooth

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,349
connectivity system inside the car and

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,240
that helps like this mobile app analyzes

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:06,370
the data sends it back to the car

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,029
manufacturer and also the service

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,400
centers so all you know all of a sudden

00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:13,960
you will get to know or you a message or

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,150
a call from service centers saying your

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,569
car needs maintenance because the break

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,580
is 80% bad and your car needs

00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:22,750
maintenance right so these are the kind

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,490
of things how Internet of Things is

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,830
really coming into picture in services

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,830
industries in everything in services so

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,450
it is

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,860
awesome if someone tells your car's

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,380
going to break down before it literally

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,130
breaks down right so this is a scenario

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,130
of Internet of Things

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:42,020
well before we get started we got to

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:45,200
know this when we say Internet of Things

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:48,500
we can use a server machine with sensors

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,870
sending data all those things it can be

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,580
called as in general things right so we

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,530
there are basically four different types

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,960
here so one is the large one generally

00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,660
when you go to watch a movie you have a

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,850
kiosk you tap on it get your tickets

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,440
printed and so on or on while you book

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,720
take a flight you can do a online

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,460
check-in using kiosks so those are large

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,650
devices then you have the mobile devices

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,750
where you can use it for instance you

00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,400
buy something from Flipkart they come up

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,980
with small device but you can swipe your

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,690
card that can pretty much be a mobile

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,550
device running our industry based

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,730
operating system on it and then that can

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,920
do all your transactions for your credit

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,630
cards then you have a small device which

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,740
is pretty much what we will show today

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:33,020
and Raspberry Pi is part of that and all

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,090
the embedded stuff comes in and then we

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:39,350
have even smaller device which will also

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:41,470
show it's lying down there it's Arduino

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,310
Uno it's mostly like a microcontroller

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,830
microcontroller microprocessor there's a

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,470
difference it's a very very tiny device

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:51,260
with less memory with a single thread

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,850
running so the programming there looks a

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,650
little more challenging like especially

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,110
for me not coming from that space

00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,330
because I always run out of memory so

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,060
these are those microcontrollers but

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:04,490
these are pretty cheap and very very

00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,950
nice for doing one task or two tasks

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,290
like just keep doing that all the time

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,450
so reading things from sensors it helps

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,700
us save a lot of course so the way you

00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,840
go up the cost increases and while you

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,450
talk about Internet of Things and

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,640
millions of devices connected your cost

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,380
really goes up when you select something

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:26,240
from the large the programming becomes

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:28,060
easier but the cost goes really high so

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,040
these are some devices Oh Arduino

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,510
microcontroller or Raspberry Pi you have

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,350
a tehsil board javascript guys would

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,270
love that

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,340
and then you have few other things in

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:41,240
till addison stuff which works with

00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:44,060
linux how many of you use Linux Wow

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:49,010
so so I was thinking of doing this whole

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:52,520
IOT scenario using Windows IOT thank God

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:55,220
thank God okay so yeah we have Linux

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,950
study right so it's all good right so

00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,110
Linux is pretty awesome for working on

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:05,150
such hardware's and we'll actually use

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:06,410
that here and moving forward then comes

00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,810
the next part before we get into the

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,720
demos is this part which is more trivial

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,640
we can do processing locally we can have

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,370
we can use absolutely use Python

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,930
libraries here but when we talk about

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,980
millions of devices of course it's got

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,930
to be connected Internet of Things

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,930
scenario or something on the server is

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,430
is more meaningful I can still use

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,310
Python on the server side to do more

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,960
meaningful analytics and that's where

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,820
the basic thing comes in collection of

00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,040
data because we know when the data is

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,630
there in the store I can run my stuff

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,190
there get the data collection is

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,980
actually a big issue with Internet of

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:42,140
Things devices when we'd say 1 billion

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,030
devices like 1 billion devices right 1

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,480
billion devices can't do a rest call to

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:49,640
an API and then at every second I might

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,950
not have a scalable enough API to be

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,950
actually collecting that so that is

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,950
where we need some infrastructure which

00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,660
can just blindly any number of data per

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,020
second it can just collect so we'll talk

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,920
about that then analysis we'll talk

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,310
about those things

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,340
consumption of course you got a you you

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:12,950
have like information like you have the

00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,480
data this is not yet information you run

00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,480
something over there get the information

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:22,220
show it in beautiful dashboards that's

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:24,050
the whole thing looks like ok predictive

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,420
analytics this is one key thing off in

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,310
terms of things I mean this is a one

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,780
thing the multi ot can be used for but

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,950
you can actually do a lot of predictions

00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:36,260
based on training your neural networks

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:40,250
or it's called machine learning here so

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:43,190
you can absolutely use that and this is

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,260
a little complex but this is how

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,150
enterprises use that so you have smaller

00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,430
IOT devices we talked about the lower

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,400
end one the cheaper ones these guys are

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:55,040
cool they can also somehow do HTTP calls

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,620
but they can't do that security

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,130
right if you want some protocol like a

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,019
qmp or m2 TT or you know some protocols

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,779
which are in use in IOT for sending data

00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,940
it might not support that so the old

00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,980
legacy IOT devices and the low-power

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,110
devices like how did we know should

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,639
ideally be connected to some gateway it

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,130
can be a Raspberry Pi gateway some

00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,199
server something and that channel

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,089
communication is under you so you

00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:22,550
secured that part so when you're putting

00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:24,529
that there because security is a concern

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,000
as I said right and it's very easy to

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,800
lead it out of these lower devices

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,540
because they can't really you can't run

00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,459
an encryption algorithm there the small

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,420
device encrypts data sends it back and

00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:36,709
so on so gotta be careful I have a field

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,149
gateway or something which collects the

00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:41,180
data which scenario it should show you

00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:43,160
and if you have IP capable devices which

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,110
can actually take care of the security

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,060
well and good you can absolutely do that

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,579
just like a mobile app can be a scenario

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:52,040
mobile app can do that so if you have an

00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:54,170
app running in IOT scenario which is

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,790
syncing data from my variable to that

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,160
mobile app mobile app to that cloud

00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,230
works well with that IP capable devices

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,339
and then internally from the devices

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:06,709
side you have stream event processor you

00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:11,569
get events collect that events in events

00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:13,519
hub or you can use Kafka you can use

00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:15,649
events hub which is a managed service

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,170
and then you can give it to an event

00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:20,720
streaming event processor so in real

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:22,550
it's mostly like near real-time so you

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,750
can do a near real-time processing of

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,430
the data which comes from different

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,819
sensors so you can monitor them in real

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:33,769
time and then we will go back to data

00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:35,930
visualization now there are certain

00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,970
architectural stuff here which will not

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,730
go much in detail which is mostly from

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,189
how you create your solution what kind

00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,079
of it all depends on what kind of data

00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:47,600
analytics do you want to do for instance

00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,639
I want to store data off my temperature

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,740
sensor somewhere but I want to create a

00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,019
trigger alerts as well so I will create

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,779
two different streams of my data one

00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:58,850
goes to my cheap storage stores over

00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,910
there the other one I can plug into my

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,620
event processor and check for alert

00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,740
conditions like temperature when goes

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,900
about 30 degree and then call some API

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,570
to notify whoever the right guy is right

00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,910
so I can have a hot and a cold data

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,710
store and similarly it's it's mostly

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,930
called as lambda architecture nioh t so

00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:23,270
we can create that absolutely now so we

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:27,320
have the app sending data app or small

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,940
device to ensure or kafka then we have a

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,580
stream event processor processing that

00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:34,279
guy it can pass the data to ml or

00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,740
service or for you know training machine

00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,529
learning and so on or finally we can

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,810
display that data to the dashboard so ml

00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:44,120
can act as a trigger or you know stream

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,100
analytics can act as a trigger send it

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,810
back to another event processor from

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,089
where you will display the data into

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:53,810
gabbana you have you know a lot of

00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:56,360
options there so let's get started the

00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:00,830
scenario this is what we will take you

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,360
through you have the sensors sensors

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,520
directly talking to this it can be a

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,370
mobile app with my Microsoft band

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,950
sending data it can be a sensor to a

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,110
gateway this would be a Raspberry Pi it

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,480
can be you know going all to the

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,959
ingestion of the cloud ingesting into

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,940
the cloud and then will use as much of

00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:21,800
analytics as we can in this and then

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,970
we'll show that to you so you want to

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:28,760
switch stuff ok so give us a quick

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,130
minute before we switch different

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:35,420
laptops what we will do is would you be

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:38,540
able to keep this on the top he shows

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,850
you this stuff I just to kind of confuse

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:44,360
you guys a little bit more think of a

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:47,600
scenario or in an IOT how would you be

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,150
able to ping a small device like this

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,190
device sending is pretty simple how

00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:55,190
would I bring this device back from

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,709
somewhere or the web right like how I

00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,810
could do a ping to a server how would I

00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:02,930
probably do that on this small Raspberry

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:07,220
Pi thing right so we'll see that little

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:08,360
later but that is one scenario well you

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,699
know problem with Internet of Things

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,620
these days generally it's not that you

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:14,209
need us over there but in case if you

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,939
need like imagine if I have to switch ON

00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,550
switch off lights right I would need to

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:22,250
like hit back to the server give a

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:25,280
message so for that will

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,829
talk about a little later right now so

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:33,820
uh how many of you worked on some form

00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:36,350
of IOT before any board any sensors okay

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:40,250
so how many of you evolved an art you

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:41,810
know excellent so for all those who have

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,030
worked on this they would be familiar

00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,670
with this environment it is the art you

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:51,290
know ID so I first first of all give you

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:54,320
an overview of what is happening here is

00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:56,300
a sensor it is called a weather shield

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,600
sensor this will just give me things

00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:02,060
like temperature humidity and light

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,390
readings and multiple others if I put up

00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:07,370
some more modules onto it below this I

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:11,030
have just basically put this sensor on

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:14,570
top of a our do you know and our do you

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:17,960
know is basically your microcontroller

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,610
in which you can put some code and try

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,980
to try to run some basic stuff onto it

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,170
the only for those who have worked on

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,570
have heard of Raspberry Pi or other

00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,580
things consider this as a very very

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,100
basic form of a development board

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,930
because this I have Arduino Uno with me

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,150
right now which means it will have some

00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:37,730
basic capabilities so I can do some

00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:39,110
small things along with it so for right

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,360
now what I've done is I've just

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,390
basically taken my sensor and put this

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,720
red thing I put it on top of the Arduino

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,070
board the connections are made I want to

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,170
capture the temperature and the humidity

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,810
from this sensor and I want to display

00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,370
it on my screen right now after a few

00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,970
minutes what we will do is we will try

00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,620
to make some more meaning out of this so

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,600
instead of just viewing it here we try

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,520
to push this data to cloud and from

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,690
there we'll try to fetch it and once you

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,910
get it to the cloud you can play around

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,920
with it a lot if you have data you can

00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,240
do analysis on top of field you can

00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,890
create dashboards out of it you can do

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,600
multiple things that is the real power

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,410
where the IOT scenario will come into

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,760
the picture

00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,130
because once you read the sensor data

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,170
you need to do something some some form

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,540
some analysis on top of it to make some

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:27,470
sense so right now I have this sensor

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:30,860
connected with me it's connected from

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,660
this port this is the USB port for this

00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,510
art you know it's connected to my laptop

00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,169
with a simple USB the wire is a to B so

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,980
this

00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:40,879
all our USB port is here and the cord I

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,789
have right now

00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:46,789
I basically what's happening here this

00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:50,179
is just taking the inputs from my sensor

00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:52,639
it's C++ so for those who are familiar

00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:56,029
they will be able to find this out share

00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:57,799
the link of it as well but this will

00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:01,159
just start giving you data temperature

00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:05,149
humidity and light so the first thing

00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:07,220
you see is the format is Jason and the

00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:08,690
initial parameters are simply things

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,070
which we are passing through up code

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:19,369
you're passing a query you're passing

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:21,499
your organization name it's showing me

00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:25,309
the location the thing which is of

00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:26,749
interest to me is the things which are

00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:31,820
addressed to me are these things so uh

00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:33,470
I'm capturing temperature it's showing

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,639
me out showing me the values in Celsius

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,919
it's effort in there but I have

00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:40,249
converted that to Celsius it's showing

00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:43,279
me light in lumens and it's and it's

00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:46,580
showing me humidity as well so humidity

00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,749
will come as I roll down but the

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,279
temperature right now it's showing me

00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:51,710
twenty four point seven five this is the

00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,489
current temperature of the room and in

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:59,059
fact if we just want to check if things

00:20:55,489 --> 00:21:00,379
are working fine yeah you see that it is

00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,450
just auto-scrolling it's just going down

00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:04,309
and down and we just set the timer to

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,489
one second so it's just starting showing

00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:10,820
me some more data basic serialization

00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:14,690
into Jason I mean and the sensor says

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:16,970
it's too cold here I mean these days we

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:27,230
have like so cool CPUs that you know it

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:29,320
M it's like cold air okay okay we just

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,869
do this again by Lyle I taught you this

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,149
okay so this is he's just shorts

00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:36,830
happening here but you got the idea so

00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:38,809
this was happening I'm getting data in

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,840
Jason the next part the next part of

00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:44,539
this would be I have deployed code too

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,499
hard you know and now to actually push

00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:50,029
it to cloud I'll be using a gateway and

00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:51,889
the gateway which I'm using

00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:56,330
as berry pie how would you build on that

00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:57,349
that's beauty pie okay so almost ha do

00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,159
you know guys have all done Raspberry Pi

00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,919
as well I believe

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,719
so uh this is the last video for those

00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,639
who haven't seen this before I won't be

00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:06,739
able to push it further because of the

00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:11,299
connections but this is what it what it

00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:13,309
looks like and this is a proper PC so in

00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:18,830
fact I've connected this to my keyboard

00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:22,369
to my mouse and let me just go ahead and

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:25,249
connect this to the monitor as well you

00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:27,859
want to see data okay okay okay in the

00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:28,909
mean while he does that I'll be - the

00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:30,619
next time I'll be doing is I'll take

00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:32,690
this odd you know just plug it out from

00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:34,789
my laptop the P USB port and put it

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,769
right here this has four USB ports are

00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:39,950
utilized - one for keyboard one for

00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:41,330
Mouse it has a HDMI port so I'll just

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,029
display this to the monitor so that you

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:47,269
guys are able to see the raspbian OS

00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,589
running there so Raspberry Pi by default

00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:50,830
you can run multiple devices on top of

00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:53,839
it that's been as a flavor of Linux and

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:57,440
we've done raspbian there we'll take the

00:22:53,839 --> 00:23:00,859
input which is coming from that are you

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,719
know in Jason take that input connected

00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:06,679
to cloud using something called events

00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:08,570
hub so for those of you who worked on a

00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:10,479
sure they'd be familiar with something

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,979
crawling events hub which is basically a

00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:15,259
service which lets you ingest millions

00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:16,519
of events per second so consider this if

00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:18,259
you're actually in an IOT scenario

00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:20,059
you'll be having multiple sensors

00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:22,309
deployed across multiple locations each

00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:24,379
of them sending data are probably at

00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:26,629
regular intervals so just to facilitate

00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:28,489
that for massive data ingestion up to

00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:30,049
millions and millions of Records we are

00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:32,479
we are using something called events hub

00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:34,999
in which will integrate those events and

00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:37,279
put it and ingest it onto cloud after

00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:39,830
that part is done even sub then we will

00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,719
start analyzing the data which means now

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:44,119
this thing which we have captured this

00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:46,099
can go to multiple things so this can go

00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,080
to a job which can display it to a

00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:50,019
dashboard or something called a power bi

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,009
dashboard if you have heard of that or

00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:54,080
we can just simply display it into a

00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:56,149
table in a table format that whichever

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,979
Jason values I want to read from this I

00:23:56,149 --> 00:24:00,619
can go ahead and display it in the form

00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:02,210
of a table so for today we will display

00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:03,680
it in the form for table will tell you

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:08,510
something about how to go about with -

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:19,880
as well and are you ready compiling

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:22,010
compiling so sometimes you're gonna like

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:28,550
trust in the garden so something will

00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:30,470
happen in there to read the value from

00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,050
this coming from the serial port so in

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:35,090
this code if you see if I were to show

00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:39,650
you here we were using something called

00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:41,930
as a pod rate to sending data so what

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,090
happens here in sealed communication is

00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,160
we gotta tell at what rate the data is

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:49,340
coming here so we will put that same guy

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,360
in raspberry pi code itself to look out

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,860
for which code to look out for and so on

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,710
so have you guys used the raspberry pi

00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:00,440
store who the people who have used as

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:03,350
berry pie okay the story is pretty cool

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,000
here like I have a few games which I

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:08,420
keep playing all the while so it's like

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,710
a complete PC itself okay so for those

00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:13,700
who haven't seen grass being always

00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:15,350
before this is what it looks like this

00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,960
is the default UI I'm using the gy

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,700
because I've been used to that and

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,800
otherwise you could just simply use the

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,070
CLI and work walk and play around with

00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,690
that I'm using the GUI I'm I can play on

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,560
with although all of these things so I

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,910
have Pythian already integrated into it

00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,230
the thing which he was talking about is

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,910
the firestore

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,400
go to Internet so if there are multiple

00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,810
things it's simply you can use all of

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,050
your commands here and get started

00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:43,940
I installed Python on it and once this

00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,890
thing is fixed once we are able to get

00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,870
the serial output from the Arduino Uno

00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:51,830
we'll take that out put into Raspberry

00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:54,320
Pi so just for that just for that data

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,570
to be collated and sent a cross to cloud

00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,320
what we are using is we are using the

00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:02,630
SDK as your SDK for Python so we guys

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,580
usually work on Azure so you if you want

00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,580
to can work on that you can work on any

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,110
other cloud AWS etc but here what you're

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,000
doing is you're basically using the SDK

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:14,240
so I install the SDK first using tip

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,450
then I went ahead and throw some about

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:23,090
twelve thirty lines of code so if I just

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:24,799
you this is the thing so first of all

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:27,710
it's a serial port one bit at a time one

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,179
connection at a time and then I am using

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,679
something called events are which I told

00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:32,419
you about which is just basically used

00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,000
to ingest millions of events per second

00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:38,059
for right now per second will be sending

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,230
three items humidity temperature and

00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:43,880
light after afternoon develop each

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,570
second will be getting three Jason

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,690
recalls in our table in our serial port

00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,279
after that if you see I've basically you

00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,049
should initialize something so I've

00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,159
initialized the key name the key value

00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:57,740
all of these things you'll get from the

00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,779
portal so if you see the azure portal

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,429
create an even sub there just to

00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:03,380
configure that to use that in your code

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,210
to connect to that from Python you just

00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:09,580
need to get those key names and key

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:12,019
values so you get that uh and the

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,210
configuration involves setting up a

00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:16,389
service bus what is the service bus a

00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,980
service process again a utility in which

00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:21,860
here and hub is a part of it so you know

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,909
the broader term is a service bus under

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,860
under that there's something called

00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:26,510
events hub we have topics relays

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,299
multiple things along with that but

00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,740
that's not the question right now but to

00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:33,649
connect to that I've given the name I've

00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:38,480
given the key value the things and after

00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:40,580
that if I just want to connect send data

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,549
I've written a simple while true loop so

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:46,940
this just goes on and on I have taken

00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:49,669
the serial port input from a cm zero so

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,169
if you would see we can find out on

00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:53,750
which port it is connected so if there

00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,789
are multiple Arduinos connected to your

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,889
raspberry pi you will need to figure out

00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,809
on which which data you want to get

00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:01,880
input from and after that you want to

00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:08,899
send that data to wherever you want to

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:11,990
so I'll just show this once so this will

00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:16,460
start sending the decent data and the

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:19,940
data which it's getting displayed is so

00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:22,190
now this is working flashed again now

00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,559
this is giving out data once it starts

00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:27,049
so it's it's it's not not like it can

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,480
run for five apps so you have a burn the

00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:31,070
stuff which we saw so there into this

00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,500
it's all working

00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,490
he would do is he would run the Python

00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,009
script here

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,179
and this is also talking so it will it

00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:41,559
should get it from the serial port

00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:41,559
without error this time

00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,880
okay this give me yeah this is this is a

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,880
different thing

00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,830
yeah yep yep yep so he'll just unit in

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:59,270
the court so it either becomes one over

00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,270
it or something before

00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:12,680
you seem 1 yep and you see next to that

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:30,590
is a baud rate so we have said that

00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:32,420
while programming this time that also

00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:37,400
can cause a problem which was odd you

00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:38,900
know yeah this was working here ok so I

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,270
think the problem is with the Internet

00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:44,870
so this is feeling that error comes

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:47,450
because of the internet thing let's just

00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,130
stick this back yeah yeah take that back

00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,900
you and your Internet of Things is not

00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:54,100
complete if you don't have the Internet

00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,100
it becomes only off things

00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,810
yeah yeah so we'll put up the questions

00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:05,090
we'll take the questions because I guess

00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:09,500
we are running short of time but we will

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:13,100
try to do this before we go once we send

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:15,290
this to somewhere which cloud or some

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,590
storage you can do any analysis you want

00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:22,640
right so that part is still left okay

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:26,270
for the microcontroller part my question

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,910
is now you are using Arduino right for

00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:32,570
programming a we are generally earlier

00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:35,990
what we're doing is just use an editor

00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:38,560
and use the AVR GCC compiler and use

00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:41,930
avrdude or something to upload it right

00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,000
so the environment like are do you know

00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,530
how much advantage it gives by hiding

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,970
all the details from us

00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:54,950
is it really you know going for a dino

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,590
or we should go for a simple approach of

00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:01,490
writing the C code and okay so Euler and

00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:03,980
you know upload it so mostly a

00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,720
prototyping device and it is very very

00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,150
so if you want to do a quick prototyping

00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,680
kind of thing works very good but your

00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,800
point is valid if you want to go over

00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,420
traditional C C++ you know in fact you

00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,670
don't want already know layer in between

00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,230
you can absolutely do that people do

00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,509
that with

00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:22,159
when they go when you have formulated

00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:23,529
your old device with the architecture

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,059
and you want to burn a SOC

00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:28,129
system-on-chip like the final device

00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:29,570
then I would think about even this guy

00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:36,830
runs something of that sort

00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:38,210
like Corsi hello my question is like the

00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,759
applications which you have shown of

00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:43,340
difference like so many cost-saving in

00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,259
terms of dollars sixty billion and so on

00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:49,159
do you have some application for India

00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:51,019
it is useful yeah III I know of consumer

00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:54,320
there's a customer who worked with us

00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:56,600
called Z sense they have done whole home

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,580
automation in India you can check out

00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,200
their website so there are a lot of

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,590
Indian customers coming in picture as

00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,590
well

00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,989
right so see sense is one of them there

00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,669
are customers cardio labs which are into

00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:10,700
my health care they have created those

00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:12,529
smart variables which patients use it to

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,869
where the heart patients specially set

00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:16,369
kind of monitors that data sends it to

00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:20,289
the cloud and the doctor is able to

00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:23,830
monitor them thank you

00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:26,659
what about the data visualizations

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,330
because we're the last set of data so if

00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:32,509
you need to plot it on the client side

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:35,899
web browser yeah so what do you use do

00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:38,869
you use WebGL or d3 with react something

00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:41,029
you can use anything you can use react

00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:43,999
like especially that is not a problem if

00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:46,070
my data is there on some storage I can

00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:48,049
use anything to bind to it more problem

00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,460
on the Asian side of Things or IOT side

00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:52,940
of things is the analytics part of it

00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:55,039
actually there's a lot of data coming to

00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,259
the client-side and we have to real-time

00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:01,039
yeah so what would be the best suited

00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:04,399
for it ok you can you can absolutely use

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,799
react right so it's it's your client can

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,109
always fetch data from the cloud service

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,629
and show it here for reducing that data

00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:15,679
or showing only the real important data

00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:19,249
you can run some kind of analytics there

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,529
patch a storm to get only those

00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:24,350
important data and show it there in your

00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:26,419
UI like you of obviously you won't show

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,649
1 million devices data coming in but

00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:29,629
only you will figure out those

00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:31,320
exceptional conditions and show are out

00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:33,900
there for that who is

00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,810
we'll need something like Apache storm

00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:39,420
or stream analytics to get those

00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:41,760
exceptional data out and put it on your

00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:45,150
UI part for the UI part we have a

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,430
solution called power bi bi bi is a

00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:49,440
dashboard UI based dashboard all the

00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,050
JavaScript done oh and you can actually

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,400
select whatever data source you want to

00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,800
connect it to and it'll show you

00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,260
beautiful real-time UI so in fact we

00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,050
have this table for the output when we

00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,540
capture the output Jason on cloud we've

00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:05,640
used again something called tables in

00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,740
which we have inputted the exact format

00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,360
in exact format in which exact columns

00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,130
in which we want so if you see right

00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,590
here it's giving me unit of measure

00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:17,610
value grid so this is fetching data from

00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:20,730
you right now my question was you said

00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,560
we will be able to ping devices the

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:25,050
senses so how do you do that we'll take

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,260
it offline so I have a node.js app

00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:30,060
running on the smaller device now this

00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,390
is not using the v8 engine traditionally

00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,130
it uses the chakra engine so I have that

00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:37,050
you can run any node capability on this

00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,970
small device now you can even if you

00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:41,190
want for UI you can use Express so what

00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:43,320
I do is that is running on Windows IOT

00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,470
so I didn't want to show that but

00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,810
Windows IOT and it can run node.js on

00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,940
top of it and I can ping it so if you

00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,860
were to ping it and get the real-time

00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,240
values from the sensor you can do it

00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:59,370
right now if we all are in the same

00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:01,200
network hi my question is like I'm that

00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:04,020
programming type of way and this nice

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,890
easy stuff and I have really problem

00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,050
with the synchronous and asynchronous

00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,930
thing that happens with raspberry pi and

00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:12,450
or you know part so that is a part of it

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,870
you guys can help us do we start from

00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:17,550
that circuit thing okay

00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:20,310
you are from electronic side no I'm from

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:23,220
computer side okay we'll take that

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,980
offline will be here in that desk we can

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:32,670
actually run through all the setup here

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:36,380
right guys any question okay why you are

00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,380
using C++ instead of beta

00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:50,430
you know yeah so so you know this is

00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,280
pretty like all the libraries were meant

00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:55,650
for that it uses C++ if the runtime is

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,020
based on that so it works well for this

00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,490
guy C Python is like we would have to

00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,730
think about embedded bison in such

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:05,400
scenarios right the full Python might

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,470
not run well on this small device this

00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,990
is a very small device no sir it is a

00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,940
small device but you know you you see

00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:16,590
also you are using in a hardened already

00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:19,260
know but when you don't use Python it's

00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:21,510
just because it's suitable for bigger

00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:25,400
devices it's awesome at doing data

00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:29,760
analytics and stuff like that but for

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,660
128kb device 256 kb device i I couldn't

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,400
find a better solution

00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,550
yeah this this doesn't has much

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,760
scalability so yeah if you devices

00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:41,850
Python is that's what for all those

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,170
other things by sangtae's that's also

00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,170
okay thank you

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:54,990
thank you guys and we'll be sitting in

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,070
the booth outside for some time so if

00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:00,230
you want to see how this is done

00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,230
