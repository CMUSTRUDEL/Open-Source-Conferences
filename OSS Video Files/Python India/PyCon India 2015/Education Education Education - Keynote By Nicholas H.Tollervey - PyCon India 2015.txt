welcome you today to of the conference I

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,300
hope you all enjoyed day one so we have

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,830
an interesting bunch of talks lined up

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:17,850
for you today so to start off we'll have

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,859
a keynote by Nicholas Holloway so to

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,220
talk to a little bit about Nicholas is a

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,910
software engineer trained musician

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,529
teacher and a writer he has authored

00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,830
Python in education & Co authored

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,719
several books on different topics apart

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,180
from that he is also a fellow member of

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,540
the pythons of the foundation and he has

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,480
recently received an award for his

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,850
educational efforts he is also an

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,870
organizer of the python uk's educational

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,050
track and has co-founded london Pythian

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,270
caricature the python code code dojo so

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,789
I'm very excited to see what he has in

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,309
store for us so without further ado I

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:04,140
would like to invite Nicholas for his

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:06,140
dog thank you yes somebody's got that

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,040
fella thank you very much okay so

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,220
essentially he just said what my first

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,869
slide was going to be so thank you very

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,250
much for inviting me to Pike on India

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,340
this is the first time I've been to

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,110
India and I'm having an awful lot of fun

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,150
what an amazing place India is I

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:27,420
especially like your traffic it's

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:30,380
incredible so my name is Nicholas I'm a

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,939
freelance Python software developer and

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,979
light like the introductory speech said

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,759
I used to be a teacher in a musician and

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,710
education is something that I'm very

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,110
passionate about still and it's

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,890
something I try and bring to my work as

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,720
a software developer as well and as you

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,979
also said I wrote a book for O'Reilly

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,530
earlier this year called Python

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,509
education it's a free book you can

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,040
download it from the o'reilly website

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,380
and it should only take you about half

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,159
an hour to read but i hope you'd find it

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,689
interesting um and the other thing i

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,850
wanted to say to you is that in the UK

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,099
there's something happening in computing

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,899
education and people seem to be rather

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,540
interested in what we're getting up to

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,710
over there so part of my talk is going

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,660
to be addressing that but

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,580
actually all I'm going to do this

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:23,010
morning is to tell you three stories to

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,450
tell you about what we've been up to but

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,910
before I tell you these three stories

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,100
these three educational stories I'm

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,560
going to make an assumption which I hope

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,390
we can all agree with so I'll do a

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,030
little bit of PowerPoint karaoke here so

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,240
I hope you agree with me when I say a

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,010
good developer is always learning and

00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,160
reevaluating in order to improve after

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:48,060
all who doesn't want to be a good

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,520
developer and also is anyone so talented

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,020
that that they don't need to reflect all

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,570
learn from anybody else I think

00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,450
everybody can pick up new things all the

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,400
time and learn new things so I'm kind of

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,680
reminded of the Greek philosopher

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,510
Socrates who said wisest of a that no

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,860
they know nothing I think that's a good

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,130
sort of an attitude to have as a

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,260
developer because our industries is

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,390
changing all the time and for me that's

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,920
that's rather an interesting part of my

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,750
work as a developer is that I'm always

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,900
learning new things it's an exciting

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:23,790
world to be in so the other thing that

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,940
wise is today that no that no no nothing

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,850
is it allows you it gives you an excuse

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,610
to be able to say I don't know I don't

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:37,070
know and I need to ask a question about

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,840
such as such an engineering problem and

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,810
the important thing is that following

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,640
that question is always a statement like

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,870
well it's going to be fun to find out

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,480
how to fix that isn't it so a good

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,160
developer is always learning and

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,640
reevaluating in order to improve I said

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,980
how does that happen well through

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,520
education so let me tell you my three

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,220
stories so the first story is a story of

00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:12,600
personal education my personal education

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:15,690
and back in 2008 2009 2008 i think it

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,060
was i was a dot net developer said it

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,130
now and you're videoing it I was a dot

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,900
net developer at an investment bank in

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,370
London and I had to work with quants who

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,310
are the mathematical geniuses who are

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,490
trying to game the stock exchange really

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:37,660
and they wanted me to write at all for

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:41,320
them whether they could script this tool

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,780
and so I looked at ironpython which is

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,639
Python on the.net platform and I

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,560
realized that python is actually a

00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,180
really interesting language but more

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,510
importantly it has a really cool

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,300
community like you guys and this is

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:58,930
somewhere where I wanted to go so I

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,729
saved up some money and and I just

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,100
before the financial crash actually I

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:08,560
handed in my notice rather lucky there

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:11,380
and so it wasn't my fault and and I

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,090
started to learn Python and one of the

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,070
first things that I did is that I went

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,710
to python meetups in London near where I

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,350
come from and while I was there I met

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,520
two people one called Jonathan Hartley

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,889
in the other one called Bruce Sterling

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,310
and we were talking over over a beer

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:29,350
about this thing called a code dojo and

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,740
we thought wouldn't it be good if we

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,050
created a Python code dojo so what I'm

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,440
going to tell you is the story of the

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:41,860
London Python code oj so what is a code

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,270
dojo well if you look into the history

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,360
of code ojos they were invented in

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:48,729
France in Paris and the philosophy

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,130
behind it is simply this acquiring

00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:54,940
coding skills should be a continuous

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,889
process it's deliberate practice so it's

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,780
as if and this charged with me as a

00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,070
musician it's as if you can sit down at

00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,490
the piano and you practice your scales

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,340
for example ok so a code dojo is where

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,240
you go to practice your skills as a

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,530
developer and the way the Paris dojo

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,000
suggested you did this the hints in the

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,789
name it's a dojo so it's a little bit

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,910
like a martial arts dojo so how many of

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:21,099
you have done any martial arts before so

00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,680
ok so quite a number of you we familiar

00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:25,990
with the concept of a quatre which is a

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,699
series of repeated steps which gives you

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,440
sort of muscle memory in the same way

00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,139
that we have muscle memory with our code

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,789
editors I'm guessing martial artists

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,469
have muscle memory for blocks and

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,599
punches and things like that so the

00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:39,400
point of a quatre in the coding context

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,480
is that it exercises you in a certain

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,980
way so that

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,700
can practice you can deliberately

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,550
practice your skill as a developer um so

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,010
we did this uh one evening about 30 of

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,020
us turned up and the way it was supposed

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,210
to work was that it was specially very

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,420
serious and people were supposed to be

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:01,540
very quiet and watch as somebody sat at

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,060
the front and coded a solution to the

00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,350
cata and there were strict rules about

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,850
who could interrupt and you weren't

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,190
supposed to be breaking this person's

00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,710
train of thought or anything like that

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,830
but unfortunately we ignored all that

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,600
and people would start typing and from

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,090
the back michael fort who i believe

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,940
keynoted he last year which out you

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,830
don't want to do it like that and start

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,510
correcting them and then we started

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,860
having interesting debate because

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,540
somebody would disagree with him and

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,860
things like that and actually we

00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,150
realized that this was a good thing

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,690
because we were learning from each other

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,130
so the other problem that we had with

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,430
the original way that the dojo worked

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:42,460
was um only a few people got to code

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,770
every evening and actually everybody

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,060
wanted to be able to have a practice

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,030
have a go at practicing their coding

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,030
skills so this is my friend Karen dr.

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,370
Kiran Mooney now he's just starting his

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,110
PhD when this photo was taken and he had

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,970
a really great idea he said wouldn't it

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:02,320
be great if we split into small groups

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,670
to code together um and with what we

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,650
were trying to work out well how could

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,000
we do this because if we worked in small

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,770
groups that would mean everybody would

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,300
get a chance at the keyboard and we

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,620
could discuss things in small groups and

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,680
things how could we get back to work and

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,060
after a few months we came up with a

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,160
recipe and I'm going to tell you what

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:25,150
this recipe is so part one of our code

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,620
dota the London rules code dojo the

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,750
first thing that we do is we socialize

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,880
for about an hour we try to make this

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,250
event as welcoming as possible for

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,950
newcomers and we get people from all

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,030
sorts of different levels of of

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,800
programming backgrounds okay so

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,140
sometimes you might have somebody like I

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,180
was I was an experienced developer but

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,169
new to python sometimes they have people

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,930
who are completely new to programming

00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,360
and we have core Python developers in

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,380
the room as well so we have a huge range

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,410
of ability and a knowledge in the room

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,930
but importantly

00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,940
we make it fun owned the socializing

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,120
aspect of things is to break the ice of

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,190
people feel comfortable and while we're

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,600
having our pizza and beer or or whatever

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:10,759
the nerd bait is in India while we're

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,100
doing that what we do is we think of

00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:16,009
some sort of a computing problem that's

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,290
interesting to us and we write this on

00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,670
the board on a board or a flip chart or

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,910
something like that this is an example

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,759
from one of the early dojos and what we

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,779
do after the sort of eating our chips

00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,639
and things our is over we vote on which

00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:35,449
of these problems looks the most

00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:38,569
interesting okay so for example one of

00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:41,500
the famous ones is I think in this one

00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:46,850
we did the roman numeral calculator okay

00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:49,759
then we split up into teams of about

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,490
five or six and there are about five or

00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,560
six of these teams okay so five or six

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,259
teams of five or six people and you're

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,250
all trying to code on the same problem

00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:04,519
and we explain that it's important that

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,800
if you are new to the dojo or new to

00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,439
programming you need to ask lots of

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,019
questions that's your task no question

00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:13,459
is too stupid okay the stupid question

00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:15,889
is the question that was never asked

00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,360
okay it's important that you ask and

00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:19,670
it's more important that the person

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,160
you're asking exclaim explains very

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,560
clearly what the solution or what the

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,689
answer may be okay which comes round to

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,550
these the experienced developers in the

00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:32,870
room okay they are there because they

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:36,319
want to be challenged as well so how do

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,930
we challenge them well we explain that

00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:42,019
it's your job to explain things to the

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:46,189
new members or the more junior perhaps

00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:48,860
coders in your team and what you need to

00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:51,470
do is explain things as simply as

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,420
possible and as clearly as possible and

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,079
this is a very good skill to have

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,579
because if you are able to think about

00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,079
where is it i'm doing this as a

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:01,360
dictionary rather than making a class

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,190
and instantiate

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,019
then you're able to justify your thought

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,490
processes and you're reflecting upon

00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,290
what it is that you're doing and

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,360
actually having somebody who's a junior

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,480
colleague going well why are you doing

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,430
that anyway hmm why am i doing that

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,209
actually it's a way of prompting you to

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,860
reflect and learn yourself okay so being

00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:23,149
able to cope with lots of different

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,829
abilities in a room that's called

00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,230
differentiation and this is how we

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:29,600
tackle it so everybody here is having a

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,880
great time coding everybody tends to get

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,610
at least one turn on the team's laptop

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,290
so everybody contributes to the code

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:40,970
it's a lot of fun and it's high energy

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,680
and at the end of this process after

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,360
about an hour and a half we do my

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,880
favorite part of the evening which is

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,459
show and tell and this is a public code

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:54,259
review how many people here do code

00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:55,699
reviews fantastic so you will be able to

00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:57,410
tell the people sat next to you who

00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,940
don't have their hands up the code

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,019
reviews are a very important part of

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,730
what we do because it's a way of

00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,829
spreading knowledge and it's a way of

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,420
you being able to explain to your

00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:07,610
colleagues how it is that this block of

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,399
code works and so on and so forth and so

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,589
by doing this in public you're showing

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,769
junior colleagues well this is how you

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:17,569
do a code review okay it's also an

00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,040
opportunity for you to show off the work

00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,690
that you've done with your team for an

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,010
hour and a half because people like to

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,019
show off the code especially if it is

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,600
rather cool ACK it's also really

00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:28,610
interesting because everybody's head is

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,500
in the same problem space so sometimes

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,940
one team will solve the problem one way

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,399
and another team will solve the problem

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,990
another way and you go ah yeah I can see

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,639
that weighs probably better or they use

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,139
that library I didn't realize they had

00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,819
that sort of library in the Python

00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,260
standard library I'll remember that next

00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:45,550
time so it's all about knowledge

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,550
transfer here as well so

00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:57,050
in the dojo we learn by doing the

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:59,480
deliberate practice we fail safely with

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,150
sympathy so again another musical

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,890
analogy for me the code dojo is a little

00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,470
bit like a rehearsal if you're going to

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,180
 something up do it in the dojo or

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,530
do it in the rehearsal not in the live

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,390
performance or in that piece of

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,010
production code okay so if you're going

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:16,430
to try something out try it out in the

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:18,680
dojo and the other thing that the with

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,000
sympathy is that when it comes to the

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,760
show and towel and this is why it's my

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,010
favorite aspect of the of the code dojo

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,780
is that often the solutions won't work

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,340
and it's a bit of a laugh when you see

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,380
somebody's code crash and burn and

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,660
things like that and they acknowledge

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,520
that but because we're all there to help

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,990
each other they're failing with sympathy

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,040
and people will point out well perhaps

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,180
you could have done it this way or that

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:44,120
way importantly we teach one another

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,400
this is essential skill for for a good

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,760
developer okay it shows that you've

00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,230
internalized the the concepts of

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,300
programming you understand how to

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,030
analogize you you understand how to

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,710
explain things you you understand what

00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,960
the problem is enough so that you know

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:02,570
what to leave out in the explanation

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:07,040
rather than what rather than trying to

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:08,360
fit everything in um so we explain

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,520
ourselves for our peers this is the code

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,410
reviews at the end and we explore each

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,170
other solutions so this is a way of

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,330
learning from each other because we get

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:21,440
into sort of habits of thought and being

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:24,020
able to see how other people think is is

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,740
actually quite a good skill so a good

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:31,520
example is when somebody is coding what

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,770
we often ask them to do is well I don't

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,680
know maybe you could tell me in the UK

00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,970
when you're learning to drive one of the

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,460
things that they ask you to do is you'll

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,840
be driving along like this and say okay

00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,970
mr. tala p could you tell me what's

00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,010
going on in your head and this is so the

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,570
driving instructor can see that actually

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,520
you're thinking about things so i would

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,140
be going okay I can see there's a zebra

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,670
crossing coming along here so I'm just

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,890
going to look into the mirror I'm going

00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,330
to slow down okay the little old ladies

00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,130
cross the road I'm going to speed up and

00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,080
things like that so people can see how

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,410
I'm thinking I have no idea what I'd be

00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,819
thinking of us doing a driving to

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:11,970
in bangalore but anyway that's a

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:13,589
completely different story is we ask

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,079
developers to do the same sort of thing

00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,490
okay I'm here to write an adventure game

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,170
that was the problem that we'd set

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,850
ourselves so the first thing I'm going

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,500
to do is I'm going to try and work out

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,350
how we're going to represent the game

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,089
world so upon reflection I think I might

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,259
use a dictionary for that the reason I'm

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:29,670
going to use the dictionary is because

00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,949
the blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,689
okay so if people are talking also

00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:35,189
encourages people to ask questions as

00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:40,319
well we're trying to get interactivity

00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:43,230
up here and most importantly we try to

00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:44,970
build our community okay we have the

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,620
socializing at the beginning but when

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,629
you're solving a problem with somebody

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,769
else and it crashes and burns and then

00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:51,389
you make it work and you're like

00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:53,009
high-five to each other and all this

00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:54,779
sort of stuff and you're able to

00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:56,910
demonstrate it at the end and it's real

00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,350
success the next time you see that

00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,579
person you'll have that thing in common

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,810
and you'll be able to talk about it now

00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:02,069
you remember that time and we got that

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,600
adventure game to work it was really

00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:08,040
good wasn't it okay we're building a

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,589
community so this is a nice segue on to

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,310
my second story about community

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:13,310
education

00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:23,439
so I've been talking to lots of you here

00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:27,639
in India about how you teach computing

00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:30,249
and it appears you do it like this which

00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,559
is how the UK has been doing computing

00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:34,299
education it's generally being a

00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,149
glorified how to use Microsoft Office

00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:43,959
lesson okay it's not very inspiring it's

00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:46,269
not really computing okay so there was

00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,229
no actual programming and often the

00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,729
people who were delivering this

00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:50,679
curriculum they were business studies

00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:56,220
teachers rather than computing experts

00:16:50,679 --> 00:17:00,429
as well so does anyone know who this is

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:06,069
no it's not the guy off top gear who is

00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:08,079
it yeah it's a burn Upton the guy who

00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:13,689
started the raspberry pi foundation he's

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:15,579
a professor at Cambridge and he said

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,049
that he was realizing that the students

00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,850
that were coming along to interview at

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:20,679
Cambridge a lot of them didn't actually

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:23,169
have any coding experience and this was

00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,360
a bad thing so he was something must be

00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:27,549
done about this and so the raspy power

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,809
foundation was set up and they created

00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:34,720
the raspa pie here it is and then things

00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:36,669
started to take off so there was an

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,919
organization in the UK called computing

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:42,360
at school which was created by teachers

00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:44,740
who wanted to actually teach computing

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,269
those the raspberry pi foundation and

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,600
michael gove who is the Minister for

00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:52,210
education actually had to listen to a

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,190
speech given by Eric Schmidt the the

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,929
chair of Google who said something along

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,059
the lines and I'm paraphrasing here

00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:03,070
along the lines of you know we're in the

00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:05,620
land of a Babbage of Turing of Tim

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,820
berners-lee and look at what a terrible

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,500
mess you've made of your computing

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,330
curriculum so something must be done and

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,289
so something wants done a new career

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,759
cream was created so at five years old

00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:17,860
children is starting to learn

00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,899
computational thinking they might not be

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,190
sat at a computer coding but what they

00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:24,940
are actually doing is thinking about

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:27,480
loops or iteration or algorithms and

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,480
things like that

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:34,070
so there are 35 is interesting because

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:36,620
it runs Python 3 and the reason it's

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,389
called a raspberry pi is because as

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,549
Evans said in the BBC interview is

00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:41,899
because it runs the Python programming

00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:47,120
language it's just a shame they can't

00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:52,190
spell pie properly so we have this new

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,690
computing curriculum and unfortunately

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,789
teachers have a bit of a bad reputation

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,830
and I've spoken to several people here

00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:00,999
as well it's the same in India so those

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,919
who can do those who can't teach and

00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:06,950
that's really unfair that's really

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,529
reading fair because teachers are the

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:15,409
single most important part of delivering

00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:18,669
such change in the curriculum ok so it's

00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:24,740
important for us to support teachers and

00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:29,929
this is what pycon UK tries to do as I

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:31,909
said I used to be a teacher why is

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:33,200
teaching so valuable well it's the one

00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:35,570
profession that creates all the other

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,090
professions you wouldn't be here if it

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,679
weren't for your teachers you put in a

00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,190
lot of effort but it was your teachers

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,200
who helped you teaching is also a

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,070
calling you're certainly not going into

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,309
teaching because you're going to get

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:55,580
millions so it's a calling and as

00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:59,289
somebody who has been both the software

00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:01,879
developer and a teacher you know that

00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:03,980
cold sweat feeling you get when the

00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:05,749
server goes down and you know your

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,429
website's offline and the payments

00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:09,559
aren't going through and something's

00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:10,700
crash and things like that that's

00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:12,980
nothing compared to some of the

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,049
challenges that teachers have to deal

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,279
with every day and teaching was the most

00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:20,990
difficult job I ever had to do ok

00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:25,009
teachers need supporting and that's what

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,720
we do at PyCon UK so as a community as a

00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:29,570
Python community this is a community

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,639
story we got together with some teachers

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,049
and we created our very first education

00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:35,330
tracker and this is a photo from the

00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:38,299
first one we had Python UK a fortnight

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,530
ago and we had 50 teachers Turner so

00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:43,230
this is a significant minority of our

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,540
attendees were teachers because they can

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,810
see that the Python community are coming

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:51,660
to the teaching community and offering

00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,640
help and support and so teachers come to

00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,280
our conference and we give them beginner

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,840
Python lessons teachers who already know

00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,110
how to program pint them give them

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,270
inspirational sort of show and tell they

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:08,280
give them ideas about how they might use

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:09,990
Python in their lessons and also they

00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,050
get to do a sort of a speed-dating thing

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,700
with developers so teachers will come

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,710
along and go I have this problem there's

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,540
this thing it doesn't do that thing and

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,980
I've always wondered wanted to know why

00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,720
it doesn't do that thing in the way that

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,550
I thought it would do yeah well why

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,900
don't you ask Tim he's the guy who wrote

00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:30,990
that thing and then and this is the

00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,910
raffle thing last year Tim Tim golden is

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:36,000
a Python core developer he was sacked

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:38,900
with some senior teachers and they were

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,890
confused because they had an a-level

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,320
project and they didn't know how to

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,450
solve it ok how are you supposed to

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,520
teach an a-level project that you

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,730
yourself as a teacher can't even solve

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,400
so Tim sat down and he solved it in

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,170
front of their eyes for them and he did

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,630
that stream of thought thing you know

00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:59,340
driving in bangalore he did that sort of

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,170
thing with the teachers so they could

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,450
see why he was making the decision teams

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,920
making ok so this is a good thing

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:10,260
because teachers are becoming part of

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:12,560
our community kids kids are the future

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:16,880
kids are our future colleagues and

00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:20,670
friends and collaborators and things and

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:25,590
so what we do is we run a kid's day at

00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:26,880
PyCon UK it's just one day because any

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,650
more days it's a bit like having a

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,460
monkey infestation in the conference

00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:36,810
it's everywhere but they have such a

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,160
huge amount of energy and enthusiasm for

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,840
what it is that they're doing it's hard

00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,060
not to be inspired along with them and

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,980
developers and teachers all come along

00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:48,150
to the kids day and they help out and

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,350
they teach and the kids take part so I'm

00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,420
going to show you a series of photos

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,320
these are some of my favorite photos

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,889
from any Pikkon ever

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,289
and we there's three children in this

00:22:56,889 --> 00:23:02,200
and it's a little story encapsulated in

00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:04,509
about five or six photos and you will

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,019
all understand exactly how these kids

00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:11,110
feel so we have Amelia and William and

00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:13,000
Sam whose mouth you can just see sorry

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,190
it's a monkey infestation here who's

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,740
math you can just see so Sam William and

00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,090
the media they are programming minecraft

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,679
you know the game minecraft which

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,380
they're all really enthusiastic about it

00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,909
has a Python API and we use that to help

00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:29,580
them learn about Python okay and um

00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:32,769
they're trying to get something to work

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,330
and William and Amelia a typing away

00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:39,159
they think they've got a really good

00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:44,169
idea here but something has obviously

00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:48,190
gone wrong Oh dear me we all know how

00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:52,029
that feels but Sam he spotted the bug

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:54,549
points it out and they've made the

00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:56,620
change and they've typed pison whatever

00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:59,409
their script name is it's starting it's

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:03,779
starting oh there's no more syntax

00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:03,779
errors that something's gonna happen yes

00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,100
code ring fantastic we all know how that

00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:20,470
feels don't we this happens every day to

00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:21,879
me anyway where's the teacher there is

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,230
no te well there are there are three

00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:25,570
teachers there they were teaching each

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:29,529
other weren't they ok this is important

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:31,149
because as a teacher it's a remarkable

00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:34,299
job as well because you're trying to do

00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:37,029
yourself out of a job you want your

00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:40,389
students to become autonomous to learn

00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:42,039
for themselves and Sam took on the role

00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:43,570
of the teacher because he'd had a

00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,090
similar problem five minutes there Leah

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,460
sort of thing no adults involved there

00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:50,830
at all so this is success so think I

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,480
think William was about six I mean he

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,240
was about seven and Sam was about eight

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,700
and that's taken young kids using Python

00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,260
with Minecraft to solve an interesting

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:04,010
problem so

00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,900
I was in an argument with somebody on

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,550
facebook about education and things and

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,500
this is something that I wrote asking

00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:11,930
what sort of education and learning our

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,230
community support is how we decide what

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,900
sort of community we become for it is

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,280
through education and learning that we

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,970
engage with our future colleagues

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,940
friends and supporters so if we make a

00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:28,280
bad job of educating these young people

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,190
then we only have ourselves to blame if

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,390
in five or ten years time we can't find

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:37,190
the people who are going to fulfill

00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:38,990
these roles so the future the future the

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,360
kids are the future so one of my

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:44,150
favorite quotes from Alan Kay who

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,120
invented small talk and created object

00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:49,040
oriented programming on he said the best

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,000
way to predict the future is to invent

00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:56,210
it and in the UK there are quite a

00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,410
number of organizations who have started

00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:04,100
to realize this so my final story is

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:07,370
about a partnership to help kids invent

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:11,960
the future and it's happening in the UK

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:13,490
right now but there's some history to it

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,630
does anyone know what sort of computer

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:21,170
this is no no no no it's not a tzedek

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:23,660
spectrum it's a BBC microcomputer it's a

00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:27,230
BBC so the BBC the british broadcasting

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:29,930
corporation along with acorn acorn

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:33,410
eventually became arm whose chips you

00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:35,000
all have in your mobile phones every

00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:38,720
school got one of these in the early 80s

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,360
when i was very very small my dad was a

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,160
head teacher and at the weekends he

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,350
would bring home his school's BBC be

00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,390
armed so that he could learn about

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,550
computers well you can guess what

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,140
happened me and my brother we took over

00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:53,590
the computer and we learned how to

00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:56,630
program I can still remember my first

00:26:53,590 --> 00:27:00,200
BBC basic program it was this can you

00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:04,670
work out what it does 10 CLS that's

00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,269
clear the screen 20 print quotes you're

00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:11,249
an idiot

00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:12,559
30 go to 20 yes exactly you're an easy

00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:16,709
or energy or an idiot you're an idiot

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:18,599
and when I did that I realized and it's

00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:20,879
such a simple program but I realized

00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,789
that I could make this computer do what

00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:26,759
I do what I wanted it to do okay I just

00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:29,129
needed to work out how to program it

00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,649
once I knew that I could do lots of

00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:34,859
really really cool stuff so there's a

00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:36,570
reason why lots of people my age our

00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:40,999
programmers in the UK it's because they

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:48,570
were inspired by BBC and the BBC micro

00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:50,309
so the BBC again now are creating a

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:54,089
successor to this project this is the

00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:56,249
BBC micro bit and it's been created as a

00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:59,849
partnership so we have people like

00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:02,700
Microsoft and arm and Samsung and others

00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:06,419
and the Python Software Foundation as a

00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:10,649
partner and what we're going to do some

00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:13,379
time perhaps in the new year is the

00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:15,929
nation's like every 11 year old there's

00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:18,239
about there's about a million of them so

00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:21,389
every 11 year old in the UK will get one

00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:22,769
of these devices okay and there are

00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:24,629
several ways that you can interact with

00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:26,099
this device you could use Microsoft's

00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:28,379
touch develop which is an excellent

00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:33,659
online platform you access it through

00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:38,959
your browser or and this is because

00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:38,959
we're at PyCon India you can use Python

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:50,009
so this is the BBC micro bit yeah and

00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:52,679
there's a project called micro Python

00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:55,229
that's rather extraordinary because it's

00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,989
a full reimplement ation of Python 3 for

00:28:55,229 --> 00:29:00,599
microcontrollers okay everything that

00:28:57,989 --> 00:29:02,609
you find in Python 3 you find in micro

00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:04,709
Python it doesn't come with the standard

00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:07,729
libraries but all the features of the

00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:12,210
language are there and we have Python 3

00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:16,780
running on this device here so

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:19,990
what could possibly go wrong i'm going

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:24,490
to show you the device here everybody

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:28,990
see that yeah okay so a guided tour of

00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:31,570
the BBC micro bit so obviously I've got

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,790
it plugged in via USB cable so i can

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:36,280
connect to it by a serial it has two

00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,960
buttons here and here okay they look a

00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:41,200
little bit like our knees and this is

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,360
hair and along the bottom teeth they're

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,980
actually I opens okay and if you look

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,600
carefully you'll be able to see that

00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,620
some of them are bigger than others so

00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:53,050
you can attach crocodile Clips do okay

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,210
and this thing here is an LED matrix 5

00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:57,760
by 5 LED matrix that you can use to

00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,470
display things on the back all the

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,210
components are labeled you probably

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:05,650
can't see them but there's an

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:07,270
accelerometer there's a compass this is

00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,550
the process of the ARM processor there's

00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,680
Bluetooth here reset button you can

00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:16,270
attach batteries here okay so it's quite

00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:21,610
a capable little device so let me put

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:28,660
that there and let's see here's my

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:31,270
terminal okay so this is the repple the

00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,240
Python shell running on the micro bit

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:39,330
okay this isn't my laptop's Python this

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,330
is Python on this device okay and

00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,550
microbe it is the module that we use to

00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,030
interact with the device because this is

00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:58,910
Python I can do fun things like oh the

00:30:50,030 --> 00:31:01,900
keyboards all weird okay this is

00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:08,810
standard Python but what I can also do

00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:16,450
microbe it got display dot scroll hello

00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:16,450
whoops icon India right

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:36,789
kids love this it's exactly the same as

00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:44,200
you're an idiot go to line 20 but you

00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:46,270
can wear it dear right so most

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:50,770
interesting Leo for us are the pins

00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:54,750
across the bottom the i/o pins this is

00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,750
the last part of my demonstration so

00:31:55,409 --> 00:32:00,280
this is perhaps the simplest possible

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:04,720
circuit you could have it looks a little

00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:07,510
bit like a bomb it isn't haha there's an

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,159
LED a red LED and there's a speaker and

00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,409
I've just pulled it into a breadboard

00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,840
there are crocodile clips that come out

00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:15,909
from the circuit and I can attach them

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:23,650
to the pins underneath let me show you

00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:26,340
what I can do with this so if I remember

00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,340
to plug it in the right way

00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:41,840
the silence is astounding it really is

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:49,120
okay let's go back to my raffle so my

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:58,850
crab it got pin 0 dot right digital on

00:32:49,120 --> 00:33:02,290
and hopefully see the LED okay cool so

00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,290
I've just reinvented the fire alarm

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,580
let's switch that off ok I can do some

00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,200
live coding now this is exploration this

00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,180
is very educational its program as we

00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,620
know this we can try things out we can

00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:19,010
watch it break and then we can

00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:21,170
experiment so let's make to make a

00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:25,940
metronome I was going to say a ticking

00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:29,710
time bomb but so I'm going to put it

00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:34,700
into a loop and then what I want is my

00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:38,990
crabbit dot in 0 dot whoops other

00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:43,100
people's keyboards right digital on so

00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:47,900
this will switch the circuit on my

00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:52,520
crabbit dot sleep 20 milliseconds so

00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:56,720
it'll go beep then I wanted to switch

00:33:52,520 --> 00:34:00,320
off and then I wanted to sleep i dinnae

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,760
for 480 milliseconds so it's 500

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,990
milliseconds in total for a cycle of

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,240
this loop so it's going to be going at

00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:10,669
120 beats per minute wait work let me

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,850
just check I think that is good let's

00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:12,850
see

00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:29,210
yeah look at that ok ctrl-c takes me out

00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:32,270
we've hidden some Easter eggs in there

00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:34,940
as well so what we want to do is when

00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,620
kids get hold of this machine we want

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,350
them to start to explore and to

00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,870
experiment and you know what an easter

00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:43,460
egg we want to make sure that those

00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:48,880
people who were doing this sort of thing

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:52,580
are rewarded so what's going to happen

00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,320
the Zen of Python note is the Zen of

00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:58,210
micro pison is what you're going to get

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,210
rather shorter than the real zenifi

00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:17,420
import love love bada-boom will repeat

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,960
it okay that was on the initializer okay

00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:25,790
so let me go back to my slides live demo

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,630
it didn't blow up fantastic okay so as I

00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,630
said I used to be a teacher

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,330
and I have some homework for you I

00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,940
borrowed this trick from carrie Ann

00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:44,240
who's a friend of mine who works with

00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:47,520
raspberry pi foundation so homework so

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,380
when you go back to wherever you're from

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,420
in India and you're thinking I had a

00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,830
really great time at PyCon India I wish

00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,920
we could keep doing this sort of a thing

00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,780
then go to your local user group I went

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,390
to the community open space yesterday

00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,610
evening and I was floored by how well

00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:04,710
organized and all the amazing things

00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:08,250
that you guys get up to in India I

00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:09,720
didn't realize this okay um but if

00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,550
you're looking for something interesting

00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,620
to do and you're fed up have yet another

00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:17,850
talks night or something organize the

00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:19,700
dojo it takes pretty much zero effort to

00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,320
organize and it's an awful lot of fun

00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:28,890
that's something you as an individual

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:31,560
can do as a community perhaps you could

00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:34,590
have a teacher's track or a kid's track

00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,950
at PyCon India now wouldn't that be

00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,950
something

00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:45,820
and what about an Indian micro bit when

00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:50,030
these devices get delivered to children

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:53,450
all the software or the schematics all

00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:56,690
the information that you need to make a

00:36:53,450 --> 00:37:07,100
microbe it will be released as open

00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:09,770
source so we have the cream of Python

00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,359
developers in india here you're good

00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:14,090
open source developers you could fork

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,310
this code you could fork this device and

00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:22,060
make it your own in fact that's what we

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:22,060
hope that people do so the deadline is

00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:29,619
due next year that's it thank you very

00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,619
much

00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:44,890
we have a question kosher so here is a

00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:46,510
question a little bit different thing so

00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,180
what what do you think about mailing

00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:53,559
lists and people replying in top post

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:55,839
versus bottom post in line reply so I

00:37:53,559 --> 00:38:00,309
will preface that answer by saying that

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:02,140
I was amazed by michal's efforts with

00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:03,819
the IRC groups and the meetings and the

00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,770
things that he does to encourage you

00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:07,329
developers into the pine community here

00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:10,270
in India could you put your hands up if

00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:14,710
you're a graduate or currently on that

00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:21,670
program Wow I think kushat should have a

00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:23,079
round of applause I always top post no

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,119
you should bottom but in fact you should

00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,890
look at the context but bottom right

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,470
your email at the bottom any more

00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:34,119
questions I'd love more questions I like

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:38,440
answering questions okay here hey stand

00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:40,930
up here stand up ah yeah so one question

00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,569
is why not use devices like phone

00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:46,480
instead of you know do i select microbe

00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:49,270
it because phones are accessible phones

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:54,400
are around with kids all the time why

00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:56,650
not use them directly okay so we could

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,420
use phones but Samsung one of the

00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:01,030
partners said that actually the

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:04,930
penetration of 11 8 for 11 year olds of

00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:06,819
phones is not that high in the UK I'm

00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:11,170
secondly the sort of phone you're going

00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:13,569
to get is where's mine o gold I think

00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,910
it's in my bag I hope it is but what you

00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:19,660
will get is a hermetically sealed device

00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:22,660
with usually a closed or complicated

00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:24,609
operating system on it ok so the barrier

00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:27,220
to entry for actually being able to

00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:29,710
program the device is quite high in

00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,359
order to make something go hello world

00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,790
on your phone you're going to have to

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,460
learn rather a lot whereas as you saw

00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:38,980
here it's only a single line of Python

00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,619
ok and the other thing is is that you

00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,660
can see in the device you can see what

00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:46,150
all the different bits and bobs are ok

00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,830
so it's encouraging people it it's been

00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,990
designed to encourage 11 you

00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,790
odd to explore this this is what all the

00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,560
part all the partners are trying to get

00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,910
our kids to do is explore this

00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,690
technology so there's somebody else

00:39:54,910 --> 00:40:05,290
stood up there and the microphone is

00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:07,330
switched off hey hi can't hear you the

00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,590
microphones okay can you hear me now I

00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:13,090
can hear you now but it's just whenever

00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:14,080
you ask a question it goes off okay so

00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,760
i'll have a follow up on this in

00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,140
question okay so what if you can

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,390
actually get up bitin console on the

00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:26,920
Iron Android device just like you did

00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:28,660
for microwave okay so on we are asking

00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,910
that they are I medically sealed do you

00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,480
have USB to serial devices or which

00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:36,220
using which you can actually canta

00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:41,290
connect anything you want to a mobile

00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:43,090
device ok so again i think that the

00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,550
barrier to entry for programming on a

00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,980
mobile device is still too high even

00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:50,380
though you make and i have seen a python

00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:52,270
repple on an android phone you could do

00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,160
cool things like that and you're right

00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:56,890
there are things you could plug in but

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,630
actually the way you plug things in on

00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,310
the microbe it is with this thing that

00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,050
looks like teeth which is going to

00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:03,910
appeal to an eleven-year-old you can use

00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,800
crocodile clips and kids are used to

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:08,200
using making making and things like that

00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,090
in classrooms which use crocodile clips

00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,790
so it's because this is a child focus

00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:16,090
device that makes it so interesting any

00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:20,080
more questions we have oh you over dial

00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:21,490
up ah got the same problem whenever

00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,460
people ask a question the microphone

00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:28,030
cuts out so what is the manufacturing

00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:30,760
cost of my grubby I don't know how to

00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:33,820
order in India how cool order that in

00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,500
India I the details of the project and

00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:38,710
the things that you will need will be

00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:41,400
released when the device is based

00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,400
relates to children

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:49,249
excuse me yeah here UK also gave us the

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,069
Raspberry Pi so in many schools across

00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:54,470
the globe is raspberry pi is distributed

00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:57,710
is there any reason that you recommend

00:41:54,470 --> 00:42:00,559
microb Torres people pie okay that's an

00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:04,220
excellent question um so the Raspberry

00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:06,769
Pi is is a phenomenally successful

00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:12,680
device I think five and a half million

00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:16,369
have been sold so far and the microbe it

00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,990
is just a first step into computing what

00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:20,059
I think will happen and this is a

00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,730
personal opinion is that the microbe it

00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:24,910
is a stepping stone for the next sort of

00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:28,069
a device which would be Iran speak line

00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,630
interestingly the version of python that

00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:31,069
you use on the microbe it is the same

00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,259
version of python you use on the

00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:35,630
Raspberry Pi so there's a continuation

00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:38,059
there it's also important to note that

00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:40,009
you can tell kids that well you know

00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:42,140
what the same version of python that

00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:43,970
you're using to right on the mark on the

00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,269
microbe it or the roster pi is the same

00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:49,849
version of python that's used in

00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:52,160
Instagram or LinkedIn or whoever it is

00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:55,249
who's who's using this so you are

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,739
learning skills that have actual proper

00:42:55,249 --> 00:43:00,259
economic valley real economic value this

00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:03,799
isn't this isn't a toy language just for

00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:05,960
children okay so I guess my point is is

00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:09,200
there's continuity from such a small

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,859
simple device via Raspberry Pi to you

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,950
know huge billion dollar companies

00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:18,859
anymore okay wave wave where are you

00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:20,299
it's me okay stand up if you're going to

00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:22,569
ask a question stand up and wave like

00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:22,569
this

00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:32,019
to make a portable a toy with my crabbit

00:43:28,749 --> 00:43:35,380
a portable toilet yep you know a fitness

00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:36,579
tracker or something like that it can we

00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:40,239
make the device portable is what you're

00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:46,329
asking yeah yes how so you can you can

00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:51,549
fit a battery into it battery goes in

00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:55,149
there yeah and several of the partners

00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:56,709
are creating interesting things you can

00:43:55,149 --> 00:43:58,929
slot the microbe it into like little

00:43:56,709 --> 00:44:00,999
robot for example that will bounce

00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:02,679
against walls and you can program the

00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:09,899
right a bit to reacting inappropriate

00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:15,909
sorts of ways I'm sorry I I can't hit

00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:17,679
screen errors going to it okay so friend

00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:22,479
of mine called David well has created

00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:24,279
the mega bit which is so you're a

00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:26,919
teacher and you're trying to demonstrate

00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:28,619
to children how x y&z works on the

00:44:26,919 --> 00:44:31,449
microbe it and you're holding this up

00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:34,479
you won't be able to see this okay so

00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:35,949
Dave's megabit is a great big thing and

00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:37,689
you slot you're my crab it into the back

00:44:35,949 --> 00:44:41,709
and you hold it up and it has a five by

00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:43,299
five light bulb matrix on the front then

00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:44,829
people can see it it's an amazing device

00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:47,169
it really is dave is a very talented

00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:50,199
engineer any more questions yeah I have

00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:53,319
a cousin okay stand up ahaha ya been

00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:54,639
waitin for so you know one practical

00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:56,499
problem we might face in India which I

00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,499
have seen is that you give one of these

00:44:56,499 --> 00:45:02,109
you know pretty amazing things to a kid

00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:04,929
and you know he's playing around with it

00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:07,809
is having fun yeah then you take this to

00:45:04,929 --> 00:45:10,199
you know to an Indian classroom to a

00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:12,489
typical protocol indian teacher with

00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:15,159
what yesterday heard from rockridge it

00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:17,049
has inertia right yeah he'll break yeah

00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:18,459
I know this stuff is good you know but

00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:21,669
this is kick stop what they're doing it

00:45:18,459 --> 00:45:24,009
was not serious you know this is the

00:45:21,669 --> 00:45:25,719
mindset right right so you know they are

00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:28,239
doing hollow well they're doing some you

00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:29,679
know some games but you know we don't

00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:30,909
ask this kind of things in the exam no

00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,030
we do serious stuff you know you know

00:45:30,909 --> 00:45:35,230
what I'm saying

00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,640
sincere especially is that and how do

00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:38,020
you change the mindset of the teachers

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,360
you know do you have any programs there

00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:42,280
or do you have this problem because this

00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:48,550
is like it I think it's a big problem in

00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:56,530
India okay so I have a question for you

00:45:48,550 --> 00:46:01,620
then who should be fixing that you you

00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:03,850
you this is what we did at PyCon UK

00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:08,890
that's intensely annoying whoever is

00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:12,610
that phone is please switch it off hi I

00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:14,290
have a question up here yeah a question

00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:16,030
in two parts one slightly related like

00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:18,670
which version of Python does it run and

00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:20,950
second slightly unrelated is Python two

00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,140
points X versus three point X like okay

00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:25,810
I have been working on two point I x 2.7

00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:28,420
to be exact and move to three point X

00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,860
still sounds like okay it's sounds like

00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,810
altogether different world it's not all

00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,910
that evidence if you actually dig deeper

00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:36,040
into it it's still different so how

00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:37,600
exactly do you get kids to start on

00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,310
something which might change further

00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,870
down line so what's the best way to get

00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:44,470
started on to something which will be

00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:46,630
there in the longer run okay so um the

00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:49,330
seeds of your answer in the way you

00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:51,780
asked your question actually so my

00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:56,020
cricket uses python3 the Raspberry Pi

00:46:51,780 --> 00:47:00,610
uses Python 3 so the general advice is

00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:02,950
use Python 3 and that goes not just for

00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:04,660
children and teachers but for all Python

00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:06,190
program is now I think Python 3 is

00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:09,940
mature enough for people to be able to

00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:14,530
use this for new projects above and

00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:16,960
beyond 27 I I've drawn my land line in

00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:22,290
the sand and stepped over it there we go

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:24,970
python 3 it's the future it is serious

00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,800
how we doing for time i'll just add one

00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:28,990
more line so there will be no new

00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,110
features coming in Python 2 dot X series

00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:33,760
so seriously no new features if you want

00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,250
to use the latest language which is

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,710
there up much better and you want those

00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:40,570
latest fancy things in the language you

00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,160
will have to use Python 3 dot X that is

00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:44,320
three dot five which is already released

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,130
so if you are writing starting a new

00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,200
project start

00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:50,319
by 10 3 yeah and you get lots of cool

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:54,759
stuff at the new a sink I oh they sink

00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:58,569
away from all this sort of stuff hi okay

00:47:54,759 --> 00:48:01,180
so my question is which microcontrollers

00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:04,029
does Micro Python work with its norm

00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:10,950
ship sorry it's an ARM chip I don't know

00:48:04,029 --> 00:48:10,950
which one okay yeah thank you questions

00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:20,180
what's the operating system which is

00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:24,579
running on that so this is running on

00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,579
bare metal okay
