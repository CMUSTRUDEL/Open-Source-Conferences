Publication date: 2015-10-12
Playlist: PyCon India 2015
Description: 
	Speaker: Arun Ravindran

We don't give much thought to the initial layout that Django creates for us. But many of us stick with it. This talk explores why Django's startproject layout is created the way it is today. What are the important decisions it makes for you? Why these decisions might or might not suit your style of development or application.

This talk will be a guided tour sprinkled with acquired wisdom from several real-life Django web applications, both good and bad. It also covers the speaker's experiences of creating Django Edge, an open source Django project template.
