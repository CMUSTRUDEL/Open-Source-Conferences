	00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,390
the topic is natural language processing

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,929
our speaker is AB enough doctor he is a

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,610
fresh master graduate from iit kharagpur

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:13,950
he interned at zomato around natural

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,960
language processing determining review

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,680
highlights from restaurant reviews and

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,090
what dish to order from anniston okay so

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,010
that might be indication that how the

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,680
stock might be but let's make it

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,359
entertaining so recently like the last

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,390
stop was very encouraging my Nicholas

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,320
and he had like given us an idea that we

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,520
should work on a dojo so as I mean I

00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,559
metallurgy was like you should at least

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,059
get something from this talk that you

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,100
can implement again when you go back

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,840
your home so what I am trying to

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,670
demonstrate is how you can implement

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,350
natural image processing because

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,510
yesterday I have attended a few talks or

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,090
naturally processing and not many

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,960
audience is familiar with it right now

00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,629
so I just want to give you an overview

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,460
of how you can do it and then how you

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,079
can go to in complexity like there are

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,000
very open source modules libraries

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,340
available in which leg within a couple

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,379
of minutes you can have like what I have

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,460
done within months you can do within a

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,680
couple of minutes to very basic

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,240
structure so i will have some quick

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,630
demonstration sorry you around like i've

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,430
embedded it since i am with like noticed

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,810
last day that it might be some issues

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,970
when you switch from screen so i have

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,030
emitted all that ipython notebooks in

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,830
this like I snapshot of all these things

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,990
she's just a short introduction as like

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,689
as already given i started with end

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,119
range in machine learning course then

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,460
went out to zomato then did some courses

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,130
in natural image processing and finally

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,020
i am presently working am i can express

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,900
so like during the talk if you have some

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,970
doubts then like you can directly tweet

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,920
tweet on my handle and i will reply to

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,259
them once i'm done with the talk because

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
it develop a couple of doubts with the

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,950
concept i am going to explain right now

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,180
so it's better that you can to eat them

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,990
at their same instant so that i can

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:58,020
solve them and not wait for the end so

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,869
this project started with the concept

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,250
like the students its base no goes to

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,329
school students like they have a

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,220
discussion going on so not like every a

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,660
single key feature cannot monitor each

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,480
and every discussion that is going on in

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,530
a school between two students so we

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,450
wanted a low frame

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,459
which can automatically judge which

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,000
students performing better in terms of

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,850
like which his argument quality his

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,430
overall stands so let's start with an

00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,680
example in that explain you so this

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,690
movie is going to come in 2016 Batman vs

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,330
Superman and there is a guy who started

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,590
this discussion by saying that I think

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,780
that movie is so cool and I think

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,630
Superman is going to win with the script

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,350
Orion abilities and all then there are

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,360
four girls on the other side first one

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,480
says Superman is definitely more capable

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,239
than Batman indicating that yeah

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,730
Superman like she's biased towards

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,470
Superman the other girl says that Batman

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,650
is so much technologically advanced with

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,590
his Batmobile and all so preferring

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,019
Backman etheretic Allah is not clear

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,450
about what she wants to like take a

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,769
stance on so she says that both I

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,900
equally powerful on their own ways and

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,300
then there is always this girl which

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,810
says that benefit is so hot so now we

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,930
have these four girls and we these are

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,150
the complexities which can arise when we

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,160
look for in a debate like if someone

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,560
says that Superman is definitely more

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,140
capable than Batman then we have to

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,459
determine like water / stands whether he

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,370
is supporting Superman whether he's

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,930
supporting Batman if someone says that

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,030
both Batman and Superman are more

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,950
powerful then we have to take care

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,750
whether is the argument good enough if

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,950
you are presenting a neutral argument

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,890
then it is not going to help in a

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,030
discussion you are basically just like

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,340
commenting on something random just to

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,440
make sure that a debate flows out the

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,420
third if someone says that yeah Superman

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,940
was very powerful but now I think Batman

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,769
is like Batman is much more technical

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,530
energy advanced so I think Batman is the

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,810
good guy or the better one so then the

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,450
debater has changed their stands during

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,150
the complete debate and the final if

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,040
someone says bana flick is so hot then I

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,260
think it is not right not able to debate

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,030
right now for this discussion so these

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,310
are the four complexities which can

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,410
arise in a debate like you have to just

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,609
the stands by the argument you have to

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,940
judge whether the argument is good

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:23,490
enough or not whether a debater is firm

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,110
on assistance and weather is the

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,760
argument related to the debate or it is

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,390
not relevant

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,700
so the first part where the argument is

00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,280
related to the debate or not is done by

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,530
sentence similarity like basically if

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,540
you are saying some Santa sentence and

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,520
if there is a counter argument then both

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,980
of them should be semantically or

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,990
meaningfully similar so if someone is

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,580
talking about Batman the other guys

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,740
should talk about Superman if the debate

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,910
is over Batman vs Superman it should not

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,260
be someone is talking about Batman

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,240
tether is talking about iron man in a

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,600
completely different context so the

00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,070
first first pillar judges about a

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,400
sentence similarity that whether the

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:06,670
argument which is presented is similar

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,920
to the previous argument the second is a

00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,140
sentiment analysis with judge whether

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,350
the polarity of the argument so suppose

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,110
if someone has a positive stance on the

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:20,320
topic and if he changes instance then we

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,720
have to capture that him finally the

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,730
third step is backtrack where you check

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,200
where in the overall debate has he

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,570
changed in stands from positive to

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,760
negative like was initially supporting

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,740
Batman now is the supporting Superman so

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,030
has he changed in stands and the final

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,910
is how can you score the complete

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,350
criteria so I will start with the very

00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,180
basics of how you can do natural

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,300
language processing then i will start

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,720
pick each one of them so first of all

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,360
why i use this like though like I

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,740
believe there's a perception which I

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,470
heard yesterday that it might be it is

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,710
slow but like I am never flee is that it

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,690
is very slow i have used text blob an

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,160
extended implementation of NL DK and i

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,710
think it works for 80 fine for me right

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,800
now i use NLT k because it has a huge

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,060
corpora delivered net and other lexical

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,730
incorporate databases are already

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:14,530
included and it's at then it's open

00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:16,150
source community so talking about some

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,040
of the very basic terminology so if you

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,320
have a sentence like I do not very feel

00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,480
very good about monday mornings then

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,360
tokenization is when you split it into

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,810
each of the words then there was a term

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,100
known as part of speech tagging so you

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,990
do not have to so I will also

00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,780
demonstrate this you do not have to

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,000
actually write like maybe 10 20 lines

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,620
this can be done in a single line where

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,639
you just pass our input to a sentence

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,659
and it can tag

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,419
what is a pronoun what is a verb so this

00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:48,610
is how simple it can be so if you have

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,669
you just imported library you just give

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,020
it a sentence and here is the simple

00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:55,509
tokenized thing which it tokenize is

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,069
directly here is a POS tagging which is

00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,620
the part of speech tagging where you can

00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,360
do it directly so to start with NLP it's

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,069
not like you need very big knowledge you

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,919
can just start with the basics like you

00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,810
can just follow the slides then you can

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,610
remove so then there is a concept of

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,870
stop words stop words or something like

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,029
is M are not nothing so you can also

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,620
move the stuff words like I do not try

00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:19,629
to move these do and this can be done

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,969
again easily so you can there is a like

00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:23,949
corpora knowledge stop words in an l TK

00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:25,419
which can simply remove all the stop

00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:29,050
words you have the filtered words here

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:32,229
and also stemming is like when you

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,509
remove the extra pronouns you have it in

00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:37,150
the root form so like the morning seduce

00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:38,830
to mourn so this is again then using an

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,680
LT case like within like I guess 15

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:44,379
lines of code you already have a

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,219
filtered database from initial random

00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:50,949
tax a text right now so this is where

00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:52,810
the initial we got database cleaning

00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:55,360
works where you clean a database from

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,939
all these like all the stove words and

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,919
all these disturbances around then you

00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:02,110
progress to sentiment and similarity

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,949
which basically is this whether your

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:08,529
argument is related to the debate or not

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:11,080
so sentences so suppose if you want to

00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:13,719
measure like whether two sentences are

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,729
similar or not then you check whether

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:17,800
the two sentences have the same meaning

00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:21,639
or whether they have the same word order

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,009
as in so this is how it can be done in a

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,129
very simple way so if you have a

00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:29,469
sentence run like a new NASA initiative

00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:32,229
will help lead the search for science of

00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:34,570
life beyond our solar system then you

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,599
can first filter it where where the

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,510
second part shows the process sentence

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,039
then you can have a combined joint set

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,290
join scent is basically you much both

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,440
the sentences to and removal of common

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,209
words now basically its basic cosine

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,410
similarity where you compare word by

00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:53,290
word to find whether they're similar

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:57,190
words or not so this is a very basic

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,630
semantic similarity where you check like

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,970
whether the two sentences at the same

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,949
meaning or not so this is how you can

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,870
vary do start with the basics by using

00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:07,240
the cosine function which is available

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,639
in any module to just calculate whether

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,459
two sentences are similar then you can

00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:15,850
have higher level filters where you can

00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:17,920
use a word net subordinate it's done by

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,690
a Princeton where everything is

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,389
organized in a hierarchical sort of

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,699
thing so you have a entity where it is a

00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:27,899
life-form then you have an animal then

00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:31,810
humans organized into adult male female

00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,889
juvenile then you can use it to easily

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,899
guy great so if you want to calculate

00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,310
the similarity between boy and girl so

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,190
you can see that you have from boy you

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:42,160
have to go to male male 2 % % a female

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,920
and female 2 girl so apart from boy and

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:50,110
girl you have calculated stepped three

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:52,269
more paths in between and you and also

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,899
if you look at animal and boy and any

00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:58,600
melon teacher so animal life form person

00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:01,120
male so there are three steps if you

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,589
look at teacher male person adult

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,230
professional it is greater so these are

00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:06,399
five steps so if you just compare by

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,069
using the number of steps you have

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,829
counted then this is a pitfall of this

00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:13,060
thing so you have to take care how deep

00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:16,269
is the hierarchy which is we are

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,920
considering right now as well as how

00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:21,250
short is the like how short is a path

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,510
length so using this concept you can

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,339
enhance the model and i have given

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,959
reference for the research paper so that

00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:27,519
this is a very good research paper in

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,319
terms of how they have explained the

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,680
whole ideology of odds and ends

00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:36,010
similarity so this is how you can

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,949
quickly do it so you use a text block

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,230
library which is a easily available you

00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:43,959
give it a sentence and it can easily

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,029
tags like this is the parts of speech

00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:48,699
where it again tags a noun first noun

00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:52,569
subjective noun and it tax both the

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:54,130
sentences then you simply use word net

00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,339
so suppose there are two words name is

00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,050
search and hunt then you simply also you

00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,870
have to give the context so that it can

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,310
be relevant that both are nouns then you

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,170
can directly calculate the part

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,420
similarity by using this simple function

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,470
so this complete

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,029
this can be such easy implementation

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,300
with few lines of code that you can

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:14,029
implement this verdant concept now there

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,550
is a word order similarity concept also

00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:19,560
so if you look at the two sentences a

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:22,589
quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:27,149
and a quick brown dog jumps over the

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:29,310
lazy fox these two are similar but if

00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:31,680
you just reverse the order of the like

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,170
dog and fox then it becomes a completely

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,029
different sentence now if you use your

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,279
traditional cosine similarity or any

00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:40,260
other method then you can directly find

00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,899
the like yeah both of them simpler

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,000
contains the same purpose so here the

00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,790
importance comes off whether the word

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,800
order is exactly same or not so you

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,389
compare the border one by one and then

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,889
you formulate a score so I'm not going

00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:54,839
into mathematical this and you right now

00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:59,130
but I am just telling you that how this

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,800
can be done like so and this what are

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,300
similarities also implemented like this

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,839
is the final formula which can be done

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:09,180
using NP linear log an umpire's a linear

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:13,170
login what's algorithm model we can do

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,029
this I guess once you have the so we

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,760
already have the semantics and we have

00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:20,279
the worid of similarity we define

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,510
overall score and this is already done

00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,220
in a research paper so nothing new about

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,890
this but this is about the ideology

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,589
where you can use the semantics as well

00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,000
as a ver order to judge whether the same

00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:31,829
both the sentences have the similar

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,890
meaning are they talking in the same

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:38,250
context so this is the final result

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,480
talking about so there are some flaws in

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,880
it which I am going to show you so if

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,579
you say that I like that bachelor in I

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,500
legged married man married man so the

00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,180
unmarried man so these two sentences are

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,860
very similar so there is a high

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,680
similarity score but if you look at the

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,930
setting second sentence both of them

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,420
contains the same word the word order is

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:01,230
very similar City algorithm gives a very

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,329
good score but one is a opinion and the

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,250
other is a question so these are some

00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:07,529
other basically some of the minor flaws

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,329
but it solves a problem right now

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,730
because in case of debate you are not

00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:12,990
going to ask and questions from the

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,430
opposite one most of the times you are

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,699
presenting your own argument with its

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:20,430
own strength so if you focus on these

00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:22,410
models these examples I've a pen in

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,690
do you live so these are the similarity

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,520
of 0 and I have a pen embarrassing

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:29,310
because pen is rated towing so this

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,640
example show you that yeah there is a

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,070
like this model has proof of concept and

00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,050
it works and higher the score and hi

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,320
Allegra symmetric similarity or

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,240
conceptual meaning so this is our

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,490
semantics work where you actually check

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,130
whether the present argument and the

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,170
previous argument are cementec like are

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:52,700
logically related to each other now

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:55,529
comes whether you are changing instance

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:58,709
sentiment is basically about so if you

00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:00,300
if I said that Superman is very cool so

00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:02,580
it is a positive opinion about Superman

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,010
so whether i am expecting a positive

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,170
opinion expressing a positive opinion a

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:10,920
negative opinion or whether i am neutral

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,779
about the whole thing so this is the

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,040
present framework like these are so

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,130
there's a site known as text processing

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,399
calm it is our API available which can

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,140
be easily exists but like for in my case

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,490
most of them have not worked in case of

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,750
debate so if you see this is like I

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,279
disagree with your statement these are

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,730
the statements which which you can have

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,100
in a debate and the overall sentiment

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,529
analysis positive like which is not

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,470
right obviously and if you give them

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:42,540
more complicated sentence I disagree

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,510
with her statement I think homework

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,970
should not be banned this overall

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,580
statement is positive with respect to

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,589
homework but this like the present

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,660
available solutions are not able to

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:56,400
process this because most of the

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,589
solutions are presently trained for

00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,510
movie corpuses movie reviews where is

00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:02,490
someone gives a movie review we're not

00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,959
considering sarcasm right now so if

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,670
someone gives some movie review then you

00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:08,010
can directly know whether it is a

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,779
positive movie review- movie review but

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,000
in case of debate like you have to be

00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:14,670
very humble as well as contradict the

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,740
person whom you are going to say to so

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,620
we need a model which is specifically

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,270
trained for it if you want to do very

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,790
easily then text block itself as a

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:26,160
module which is give it a sentence and

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,320
ask you the sentiment it can directly

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,900
give you the sentiment without you using

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,570
any your own inbuilt model so you do not

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,320
need to code anything but like this does

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,390
not work also

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,180
so you have I disagree with your

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,550
statement which has a polarities when

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,910
like so there is no positive or negative

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:48,000
opinion subjectivity says whether its

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:50,100
opinion it's a fact so right now if I

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,380
say Superman has Kryptonian abilities

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,690
then it's a fact that Superman's

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,760
Kryptonian abilities but if you say that

00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,680
Superman is very cool that it's my

00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,790
opinion of superman and it can change

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,100
from person to person so these are some

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,760
of the examples of like how you can use

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:11,150
it but it does not work right now so I

00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:14,700
started like we used a simple approach

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:16,500
the standard Navy base classifier we

00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:19,520
trained it on Congress presidential

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,600
debate like the link for the debate is

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,780
is they believe in the core / section

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,220
this is the available this database is

00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:29,010
very well maintained it's done by

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,530
cornell university they have so it is a

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,920
database where there is a debate going

00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:38,100
on and every argument so the argument is

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,650
like maybe like 10 15 lines so every

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,840
argument stag whether the debater has

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:46,910
presented a favor argument opposite

00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:49,380
argument so you given a base classifier

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,590
unnamed classifier is basically it is a

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:57,360
conditional probability thing so if you

00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:58,830
say that after so I like Superman so it

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,630
basically calculates probability that is

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,940
what is a probability that if this words

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,350
of occur after this word then it will be

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,510
a positive sentence it will be negative

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,540
sentence so on the basis of sequence of

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,040
words it calculates the probability so

00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,750
you give it a training corpus of

00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,540
Congress patients presidential debate

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,610
are labeled raven corpus saying it

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,140
whether it is like positively labeled

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:22,160
whether the argument was positive or

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,329
negative using this complete corpus and

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,459
finally on the basis of probability

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,320
score do determine that if the

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,470
probability score is did in point six so

00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:34,020
this is the Prince own benchmark then

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,610
you it says a positive sentiment if it

00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,110
is not on the negative side are not on

00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,600
the positive side it is a neutral thing

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:43,110
so 0 represents whether it's a neutral

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,680
or not and one represents it's entirely

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,000
positive thing so based on these you

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,860
like be in the output

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,170
the classifier you determine whether the

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,090
sentence was positive or not and I will

00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,100
just show the results talking about the

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,530
features so there is a article by steam

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,140
steam hacker where they have been a text

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:04,470
classification thing so in case of like

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:07,560
sentences they have demonstrated that if

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:10,950
you use by grams so by grams will

00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:14,250
present two words so if suppose Superman

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,960
school Superman is a bigram if school is

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,300
a bigram so pair of two what is the

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:23,370
Biograph so they have demonstrated that

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:25,620
if you use a couple of diagrams as well

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:28,170
as single words so if like if there is a

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,330
word which has very high frequency so if

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,190
there is a voice message disagree now

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,430
disagree itself in a statement can

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,740
demonstrate that yeah the person is has

00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,870
a negative sentiment so using the

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,540
combination of such words and Biograph

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,250
you can have a very powerful model so

00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,590
this model has a trainee accuracy i get

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,540
sixty five percent right now on the

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,420
sentiment ring and like the best i've

00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,130
seen till now for the open-source

00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,650
modules is like seventy percent like

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:59,280
there is also model by MIT right now but

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:02,190
i am not sure how to implement it so

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,290
this is how it works so this was were

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,570
present issues if someone sees i

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,830
disagree with your statement then most

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:11,760
of the classifier were not able to

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,650
classify it so now the classifier so

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,210
once you have trained it then this is a

00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,580
very easy line just to implement

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,160
classifier not classify my present

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,700
sentence and it says this is negative

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,790
and if you have i am against homework

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,730
ban so this overall sentence is positive

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,650
because you are positively aligned

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,390
towards the homework so this is how the

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:38,820
present model after the new base

00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:41,010
classifier works so you have the

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,570
sentence similarity with checks whether

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,020
the argument is related to the debate or

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,550
not you have the sentiment analysis with

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,140
check what is the polarity of the

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,500
argument whether it is positive negative

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:56,100
or neutral now you have to make sure

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,410
like now the basic question is i know i

00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,470
can compare two sentences and tell

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,659
whether they're similar or not

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:06,020
now which two sentences should I compare

00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:07,700
or I can tell that this argument is

00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,480
positive or this argument is negative

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,010
but how will I know that whether what

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,020
was this previous stance like whether

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,549
his previous argument was negative so

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,010
this argument should also be negative so

00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:21,409
I have to keep a track like which two

00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,559
sentences to compare which two sentences

00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:27,110
to have similar stands and all so this

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,690
is we call back tracking where you have

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:32,210
whether the debater has changed instance

00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:36,559
or whether the argument is good enough

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:39,380
or related so first of all this is how

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:44,150
the interface UI looks like this was

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:47,570
done in Django so there is a django chat

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:49,909
plugin which was a double shyron so this

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,669
is this is easily understand it has a

00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:55,010
very good API where you can use it the

00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,929
advantages are any chat log can be so

00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:00,110
there is a JSON format directly

00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:01,460
available for all the charts so this is

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,559
how the framework looks like where

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,799
there's a admin which starts the whole

00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:09,400
thing then there is user one who

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,230
presents argument and there is a user to

00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,030
like who counters who counters thing so

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:19,700
it's presently a multiplayer like a

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:21,350
two-player game right now so this is one

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,230
of this visualization the whole debate

00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:26,419
that how it has gone gone so this is a

00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,940
manual thing done this can this is I

00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,200
have done this in Python but like it can

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,960
be done without having this much

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,000
visualization so suppose you have a

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,409
argument which is started by the admin

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,350
saying that should we ban homework or

00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:42,799
not someone says I am in favor of this

00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:44,510
notion so if you see the overall thing

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,909
should we ban homework and I am in favor

00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:49,640
of this notion so basically he is

00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:52,280
against homework and if someone says I

00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,500
am engaged this notion so he is

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,990
basically in favor of this whole concept

00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:00,169
of like he show he is in favor of

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,809
homework now so if you see this

00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:04,100
gentleman here the next argument which

00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:06,559
he presents his homework as little

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,710
educational worth so his present

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:13,520
argument is negative and his overall

00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,360
stands that he was always against

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,640
homework is also

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,770
negative so like he is currently

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,920
following what has he initially proposed

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:25,070
that he is always against the concept of

00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:28,070
homework where is this lady on the other

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:30,260
side I am against this notion she will

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,600
always since she's always inclined

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,870
towards homework she will always present

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:39,290
arguments that whether you are that she

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,880
is in favor of the homework so you we

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:44,090
have to keep track of the thing that

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,310
whether if someone has taken I stands so

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,490
if the user one who has a overall

00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:51,020
negative stance towards homework does he

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,620
or she maintains that during the

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:57,170
complete debate which is going on so

00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,350
this is what the overall crux of the

00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:04,040
whole thing that if you start argument

00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,900
fresh argument then and the next

00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,090
argument should have the like so if

00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,400
someone says I am against homework then

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:14,420
most of the arguments should reflect he

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,940
or she is against homework also if there

00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,800
are counter arguments so if you have

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,200
this argument that homework is little

00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,280
educational work and if someone says

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,390
there is strong and positive

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,770
relationship then both of the arguments

00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:32,020
should be opposite in polarity to each

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:35,480
other and the final things that comes is

00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:37,700
how so if someone says two consecutive

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,870
arguments together then they can have

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,550
the same poll idea so these are some of

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,960
the technicalities which I have

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,570
mentioned in the slide so that if you

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,860
want to start it so there you can have

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,700
your what are the things that you need

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:52,220
to consider and talking about so suppose

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:55,580
if someone says I mean homework is

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:58,100
little educational worth here so we have

00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,830
to check whether this statement which he

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,510
has presented here is he talking about

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,490
the homework or not so you also have to

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:08,480
compare whether these two sentences like

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:11,120
this and this are meaningfully similar

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,490
to each other or not so you have to

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,150
track the scent sentiments as well as

00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:20,450
you have to drag the semantics so this

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:22,760
is a quick recap so first of all you

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,310
start with in a debate thing you start

00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,090
with measuring the sentence similarity

00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:31,299
where you find whether the two similar

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,590
score between two sentences so that you

00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:34,320
can know whether they are meaningfully

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,000
similar there were other similar or not

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,340
then you have a polarity of the argument

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,740
which says whether the argument is

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,630
positive or negative or not then you

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,990
have a backtracking thing which tells

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:48,640
you that among which sentences the

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,860
similar similarity should be measured

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,279
and which sentences you should consider

00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,020
to measure sentiments and all finally

00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:58,450
when you have all these three pillars

00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:05,080
then you can arrive at a scoring

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:07,630
approach so scoring approach takes care

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,850
so this right now this scoring

00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,200
approaches pettiness and even I am

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,570
looking for inputs from the audience

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,029
right here so presently we have just

00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:19,000
implemented it and it works for like it

00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:21,909
has worked for our few sample cases so

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,149
we have a sentence level score which is

00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:27,669
SS and you have a semantic score so for

00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:29,710
if the argument is in a correct flow

00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:32,260
like if no none of the user has changed

00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,539
his stance then we give a 75-percent

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,000
voltage to semantic score and twenty

00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:38,559
five percent weight is too similar like

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,510
the same Jefferson weight is basically

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,330
to the meaning score and twenty five

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:45,370
percent weight is to the polarity score

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:49,059
but if the user has changed his stance

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:51,100
during a debate then we changed then we

00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,919
actually penalize him that why he has

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,590
changed stands during the debate and

00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,659
again there is an amplification factor

00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:01,360
so suppose you present the argument that

00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:03,190
is very good and now the opponent has to

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,380
argue that otherwise he is going to lose

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,179
her a bit because the argument quality

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,210
is pretty good right now so sometimes

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:12,760
there are some arguments which can

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,450
attract discussions which can invite

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,460
audience audiences like you should

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:21,549
counter this argument so created the

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:23,980
discussion goes on more relevant or more

00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:26,350
stronger argument is so amplification

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,120
factor basically counts that how deep

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,880
like how much discussion has gone on a

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,100
particular argument so on combining all

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,140
these things you have a score of like

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:38,950
this is technical and you can again go

00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,910
through and this is the finest slide for

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,400
me

00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:45,580
so these are the present challenges

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,560
which I phased right now so as you might

00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,470
have seen that this is all natural

00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,660
language processing but this guy does

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,150
not talk about what if i visit presenter

00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,950
fact from some UN report saying that

00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,690
homework has affected or benefited so

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,610
many people yeah so that is a valid

00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,830
point that I have not considered factual

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,230
strength and now that how strong is the

00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:08,020
fact it can be done by scraping through

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,520
web and that is not implemented also

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,220
this has been tested on a couple of used

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,340
cases that's why I'm light now looking

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,990
for some of the arguments so suppose if

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,450
you want to test it then there is a

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:23,170
pretty comprehensive site known as I

00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:24,850
debated Oh RG where you can scrap all

00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,230
the debates so it has a debate database

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,570
you can scrap all the debates and you

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:31,930
can validate it through using a model

00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:34,000
and finally most of an abyss classifier

00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:35,530
is separated so there is separate

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,440
classifier for neutral arguments in

00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:40,960
motion abyss applications because

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,240
neutral arguments have some complexities

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,070
because they can have some sarcasm where

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,910
someone might not be referring a

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:51,610
particular opinion but he is just trying

00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,140
to counter it so presently an abyss

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,260
classifier is not designed to capture

00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,880
neutral argument separately so these are

00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,990
some of the flaws or the challenges

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,600
which are present in it right now so I

00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:07,230
think I'm pretty quickly dilated so I'm

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,230
looking for questions

00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:14,780
hello thank you for the talk I want to

00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,190
ask like when we talk about debates so

00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,350
informal debates they are really

00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:21,380
moderated and everything is in a flow

00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:24,860
but the Django have that you told about

00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:28,010
it is a chat based debate right so in

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,830
chat base debates the replies are not

00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:33,290
direct and moderated for example the

00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:35,300
Batman vs Superman case if there is an

00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:37,700
argument that yes Batman is really cool

00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:42,200
and down it was the reply might be Yeah

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,820
right with ! so sarcastic comments how

00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,860
are you actually tackling them how are

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:49,490
you capturing their notion as well as

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,080
the sentiment in a out of it so right

00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:53,810
now the abyss classifier cannot capture

00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,330
sarcasm but if someone wants to capture

00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:57,770
sarcasm then there is a so there is an

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,260
implementation by MIT on sentiment

00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,300
analysis where the capture all the

00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,920
sentiment using a tree way sort and you

00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:07,040
can access it like there is a way of

00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,960
living for it but yeah the point is that

00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,510
it is not captured right now and if

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,150
someone says yeah that's right so that

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,380
is that you are like confirming his

00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,910
stance but you are not presenting our

00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:22,400
opinion so we do not value that thing

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:27,560
right now I don't let's say like hi

00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,180
listen yes I ok besides it's a ok let's

00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:33,850
say like your corpus is from social

00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:37,400
later ok now nowadays like in social

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:39,980
people are using short text so how

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:43,510
you're going to overcome with using this

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:46,790
NLP yeah how do we have any classifiers

00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,080
yes so in case so there is a social it

00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,910
is basically like if you are talking

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,430
about short sentences and social data

00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,920
and they even linked linguistic sentence

00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:57,350
as well it says bilingual yeah so

00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,950
basically I can take to Dennis example

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:02,810
right yes so even for Twitter sentiment

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,150
analysis like I have gone through

00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:07,520
several papers and me base classifier

00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,840
has work to be the most but there are

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,080
certain things you have to take care of

00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:14,390
first of all the emoticons depict a

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,220
particle essence of sentiment so you

00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,260
have to have a separate classifier which

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,850
can tag that if these are the emoticons

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,530
then what is the probability of a

00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,490
particular thing which is an abyss class

00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,490
if I can do

00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:28,250
then you have to replace like Hello save

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,140
someone says hello with like 10 or 11

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,210
knows then you have to like so there is

00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,429
a vocabulary for it which can replace

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:37,880
short forms like what's up into what's

00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:40,220
up you can have to clean the data and

00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,410
Nimbus classifier till now I have known

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:46,760
worked best in case of like the social

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:49,670
sentiment analysis thing I my question

00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,130
is the in you have talked about sentence

00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:56,000
similarity yeah in case of pronouns

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:58,210
pronounced if the debaters use pronouns

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,020
in the index antennas how will you

00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,809
analyze the similarity between the

00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,750
sentence can you give me an example like

00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:10,370
means if you are talking about Congress

00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:13,490
and BJP yeah someone says BJP's is quite

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:16,420
bad working badly and and and the

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:20,480
internet sentence they said they are

00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:22,160
they are worst means how then how can

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,420
how will you come by that they are

00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,010
similar sentence and they are talking

00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,910
about the same context in the same

00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:30,710
contexts so yeah if if us the same

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,740
debater is presenting in arc if someone

00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:35,480
says they are versed I have the same

00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,160
debater is continuing its argument then

00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,040
you can easily track it that which is a

00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,170
debater if someone else starts argument

00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,790
then it's difficult to track that with

00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:46,760
so if someone says so you say it

00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:48,020
Congress is bad and if the same guy says

00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,790
they are versed so we are actually

00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,400
checking who has see at the previous

00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:55,010
argument to know like whether it's the

00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,600
same guy or opponent so if the same guy

00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,820
then you can easily track that who has

00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,530
said the last argument I mean and and if

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,900
what if in the say in the first case

00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,670
they are using pronouns in that in that

00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,760
case how will you mean sir how will

00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,440
occur just the context in when they're

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,480
pronounced right yeah that's an

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,790
assumption right here where you consider

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,770
that if someone's so if slight debate is

00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,210
about should be vain homework and if

00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,070
someone says yeah I yeah you should ban

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,059
it then I am considering that if you are

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,550
saying you should ban it and you're

00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:24,890
talking about homework right now so

00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,420
there's nothing a lot resolving the

00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:29,150
pronounced means you are not resolving

00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:32,840
the pronouns the mound of used for which

00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:35,240
and for which in which context means it

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,770
is used for VZ APR is used for Congress

00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,260
right now there is no

00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,460
thing like so there is even you're

00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,720
talking about discipline on this

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,610
amputation there is a word sense

00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,140
disambiguation also so these are the

00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:48,110
some of the complexities which I am not

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:52,820
included for this particular model thank

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:54,860
you it is you gave that example about I

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,660
do not feel very good on Monday mornings

00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,120
i mentioned that knot is a stock pot

00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,250
butter that actually completely reverses

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,320
the meaning of the sentence yeah so I

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:07,850
don't think not can be a stock word yeah

00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,680
so when so not as action so if i use

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,810
that not nothing removal store but it

00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,400
will remove it but in case of debates

00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,920
you cannot afford to remove stop words

00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,230
so when this analysis and then on debate

00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,300
corpus using features then you actually

00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,920
do not remove stop words and all you

00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,560
consider the same sentence in any

00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,720
process it so like if you want to read

00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,520
more so this article can kill you so you

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,060
do not remove all these things because

00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,350
not nothing and they do not and all

00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,300
these are removed in some most of the

00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,310
cases so you cannot afford to remove all

00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,810
these stop words from the corpus when

00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:44,000
you are talking about debate yeah it is

00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:46,100
yeah so in most of our cases you have to

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,050
I am located data to have look at some

00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,380
other sample cases to have an Idaho

00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:53,240
threshold because it's so it's a simple

00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,920
for me it was initially a simple judge

00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,940
one call when I say it was greater than

00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,260
0 point five then it's a positive

00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,090
argument less than point five it's a

00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,040
negative argument but then you talk

00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,750
about in neutral arguments also so it's

00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,490
some manual thing right now so that's

00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,080
why there is a need for you to have a

00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,179
separate name is classified pause

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,890
positive and negative and a separate one

00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,540
for neutral arguments so you do not have

00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:15,409
to read you have this manual task and

00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:18,110
you can have this complete automation in

00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:20,720
the arguments or debates it's open

00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:25,700
common / open ends to qualify like

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:27,409
qualify this position I mean to to agree

00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,179
to the openers position for some time

00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:32,750
and then constructively contradict them

00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,159
how do you tackle that problem so this

00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,929
problem of where you actually use

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,190
sarcasm or where you use contradiction

00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:39,290
in your pian statement is still not done

00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,450
in this I'm not contradiction I mean

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:43,700
let's say a you an example that

00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:47,120
regarding the homework problem it is

00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:50,030
let's say I start my argument as it is

00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,500
open it is a fact well known

00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,960
like it's a well-known fact that

00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,900
homeworks are good and they they are

00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,630
good for a student but in today's world

00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,970
it has become more of a liability and

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,360
then so it's like a first qualifying for

00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,980
a qualifying the position and then

00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,270
contradicting it so if you check that

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,420
the overall strength of the whole

00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:13,040
sentence will be negative because so I

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,860
check this thing using the stands thing

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,080
and the name is classified train itself

00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,060
in the Congress debate that so we have

00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,770
checked with these things where you try

00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,210
to initially present I stands and then

00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,130
counter it in the next half of the

00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:29,990
sentence then this can this luxe hotel

00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:31,850
is indicated in the purpose hey is there

00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,820
any alternative to the naive bayes

00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:37,640
classifier because i used it for

00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,860
sentiment analysis on tweets and so the

00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,560
NLT k call i didn't use the NLT k corner

00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,790
so i use my own corpus and when i had a

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,830
large collection of tweets and the

00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:49,490
training phase took a lot of time when i

00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:51,080
use the naive bayes classifier so is

00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,780
there any alternative so there are also

00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,730
like people have run even knew no sin

00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,860
Disha entries on these things but i

00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,150
believe like the name is classify the

00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,440
time might be like it's about a

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,970
preprocessing so if you do not remove

00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,770
Smiley's if we do not remove all the

00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,900
vocabularies then it is going to take

00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:07,760
time but neighbors classify as far as

00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,440
you know is the best in case of social

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,720
sentiment analysis where you have to

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:17,660
unless the social arguments so have you

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,120
tried using the same keyword in it it

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,830
used to be there along yeah I am not to

00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,410
be centenary I've just used text blob

00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:25,790
and text processing com basically to

00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,890
implement leasing you haven't tried it

00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:30,020
yeah you have not tried it but like this

00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:32,480
project was done under the supervision

00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:34,550
one of the professor's also so we came

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,140
to know about like the debate seen

00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,220
scenario so there's a paper about it

00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,590
that the debates in air is very

00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,630
different because it's more about

00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,490
politely disagreement as compared to the

00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,170
normal disagreement where you say like

00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:47,210
this movie was so horrible that I cannot

00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,590
sit for the half time also so it's not

00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,730
that strong sentiment way you can

00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,890
capture it so you have to have my

00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:57,710
sentiment captures which is not done by

00:36:51,890 --> 00:37:00,080
most of the cases okay did you use any

00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:02,390
feature transformation while training

00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,490
the classifier like tf-idf or maybe just

00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:06,190
taking the count

00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:09,790
of the diagrams you have used yeah so

00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:12,970
this top 200 unigram shin-bi grams are

00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:14,560
calculated basing so suppose if that TI

00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,170
fight if concept is implemented so if

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,970
some biografia frequent across all the

00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,440
debate thing so that by graham is given

00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,210
a lower priority so this is then tf-idf

00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,790
is considered for each of the uni grams

00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:27,280
so NLT k has an inbuilt function so if

00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:30,070
which can give you top 200 unique grams

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,210
or diagrams based on whether like under

00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,130
your thumb frequency which document

00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,950
frequency be it's basically known as

00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:37,180
information retrieval that how much our

00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:41,350
information a unigram or by campaign can

00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:43,570
wave ok have enough one question like i

00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:45,990
was doing twitter analysis and left

00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:48,670
problem web what I was facing is like

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:51,490
sometimes like a statements is like we

00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:54,190
take a Superman vs Batman example except

00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,619
a man is not good and the other question

00:37:54,190 --> 00:38:00,640
the other statement could be Superman

00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:02,980
Superman is not bad so this not changes

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,170
the words completed sentence completely

00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,690
right so like if I give a number like

00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,430
for not I give a minus one so how do you

00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:14,280
directly change it according to the

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:17,440
sentence like not share not with cool is

00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,570
like not good and you're not bad is a

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,820
positive word complete sentence is the

00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:24,040
positive so how do you deal with this so

00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,320
right now it's it's a probabilistic

00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,940
model where it like so if someone you

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,850
have mentioned a sentence like not bad

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:33,690
which reflects a positive which is

00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:36,100
mildly positive where is not cool is

00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,390
negative and it's very common so this

00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,510
name is classified use a probabilistic

00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:42,119
model so if it's a not but not cool

00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:44,859
thing so it is going to give a higher

00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,960
negative sentiment to it but if it is

00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:49,480
not bad then it is going to give a lower

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,850
positive sentiment to it so it is a

00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,980
probabilistic model like how common it

00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:57,010
frequently occur then it gives a

00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,920
probability so if just saying it once

00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:02,320
again clearly for you so Superman is not

00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,500
bad is a very rare term in terms of the

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,630
debate corpus so it is a mildly positive

00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,030
thing and it will given get a less

00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,770
positive score in the sentiment whereas

00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:13,660
Superman is not cool is very common case

00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,280
of debates so it will give a highly

00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,080
negative thing so you can judge like

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:23,110
which is the most strong argument normal

00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:26,100
cases actually two questions yeah first

00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:29,070
how you detected the double negations

00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:32,350
the double negations means one negative

00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:34,330
coupled with another is the

00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,970
question he asked already the

00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,710
probabilistic model it is what it is

00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,170
well it was like something were to whack

00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,570
or something where you try to see that

00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,280
context and based on that you know so I

00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:47,650
have not implemented what to work and

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,630
like even were too vague discussion I am

00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,580
I have seen that it is a good

00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,920
representation of words and so I am not

00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,150
seen how it works in like for me I have

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,670
not seen how it worked in sentences

00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:00,490
similarity it right or simple leave is

00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,750
classifier so it's an independent

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,430
probability assumption where you

00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,710
calculate that if this works or whether

00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:08,590
given the different words for what is

00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:11,560
this overall sentiment of that yeah it's

00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:14,350
a simple name is classified thing last

00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:18,010
question yeah so most of the debates are

00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:19,650
like speech and for do NLT k you have to

00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,790
have text and speech to text

00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:24,580
transformation is another challenge how

00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,380
do you tackle that so that yeah that's a

00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:29,650
pretty good question and even like most

00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,330
of the speech so if you saw already this

00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,580
sentiment has a seventy percent accuracy

00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,960
speech my fav and the scent is seventy

00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,270
percent accuracy so this is addressing

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,770
to forty-nine percent so I cannot so

00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,990
this might not work good well in case of

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,790
speech debates Congress HP generates so

00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,200
these are some of the debates like when

00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,460
I do a talker then grace someone a

00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,200
typewriter who is actually noting all

00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,880
all the comments so this is how it is

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,800
made and it is that's it there is a chat

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,060
frame up for it and I think I'm not sure

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,790
how it can be done in case of speeches

00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,590
where the accuracies get in 75% so you

00:40:54,790 --> 00:41:02,350
don't have a fair judgment whether it is

00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:04,410
good or not thank you everyone thanks up

00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,410
