00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,670
edition of vikon India 2015 so when we

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,450
you know started this often 2009 as a

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,879
fully volunteer-driven no conference

00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,530
could never imagine that we will be

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,460
doing this for you know after seven

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,730
years because it was pretty ad hoc and

00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,829
kind of came out of discussions in the

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,979
mailing list but I am pretty happy to

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,490
see that you know that spirit has

00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:12,090
continued and the people who kind of

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,650
started that 70's back now we have

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,500
become a little bit older people

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:20,250
including me and vice or hopefully now

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,110
we have a you know a lot of younger

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,450
people the anger generation coming in

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,790
taking care of the the conference and it

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,270
is still completely volunteer-driven so

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,380
big hand to all the pike on india

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,380

to the back on India before we start the

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,800
proceedings I just thought I will share

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,780
in a few thoughts about and some

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,140
statistics maybe you know to bore you a

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,430
bit so that right we have an idea of

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,860
what has been happening behind the

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:30,930
scenes this year we had thousand five

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,120
hundred and sixty registrations the

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,120
highest so far in pike on India history

00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,760
you know the number of Delegates number

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,280
of people who are attending this they

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:53,850
represent nearly 550 different

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:55,500
organizations I'll tell you how we

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:59,730
arrived at all these stats used a python

00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:04,200
package so okay and some of you must

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,570
have guessed what that is yeah so this

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,420
time we have fifty percent retention

00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,590
which is actually a record so fifty

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,739
percent of people who visited last year

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,860
have come back this year so there are

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,489
fifty percent our new no new faces

00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:22,709
welcome to all the new faces we have a

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,250
much higher participation of you know

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:29,430
women this year it is up by five percent

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,720
if I am right and i think it is this

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,130
year it is eighteen percent of the total

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,130
you know total participation

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,750
this year we have introduced new new

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,820
initiatives like child care in order to

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,420
kind of facilitate the women

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,640
participation because you know last year

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,070
the stash told is that most of the women

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,900
are you know who want to attend their

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,400
the main problem is basically with the

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,470
family and bringing kids so we have

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,270
taken care of that this year we had a

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,030
deaf sprint for the first time in pike

00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:04,660
on India you know that was yesterday it

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:09,880
happened so lot of new initiatives you

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:18,700
know completely different conference so

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:23,200
welcome you all once more our next

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:26,500

here big hand to mr. Vijay so mr. Vijay

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:43,090
has his embedded software developer and

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,130
trainer as I logic systems so apart from

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:49,690
developing python-based embedded systems

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:55,090
based on tell it he is a big community

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:57,460
contributor for Python he kind of kicked

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,460
off the GNU Linux user group of trichy

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,100
back in 2001 when he was an undergrad

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,410
there since then he has been actively

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,830
involved in helping to organize meetups

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,229
workshops demos and conferences he got

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,390
associated with chana peopie in 2010 the

00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:15,910
chennai python users group and since

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:19,630
then he has kind of accelerated the

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,300
group and I know he has rapidly expanded

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,710
the quality of the mate herbs and the

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,470
diversity of the people attending it so

if you go to Chennai pider dodgy which i

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,400
think is the homepage we will find that

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,990
all the meetups are well documented and

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,580

what we have been doing chennai python

00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:53,360
user group so just a few words before I

00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:55,430
wind up so I inherited the role of

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:02,120
coordinating the Chennai python user

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:04,430
group after the previous coordinators of

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,139
the year can I patent user group

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,850
actually moved away and

00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:13,460
initially we were running at tag like

00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:17,660
yet another user group but then at one

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:20,480
point I decided okay it's it's not going

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,889
to work this way what are we have to do

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,250
we have to do it in the best way

00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:28,370
possible do it with utmost care and

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:34,520
sincerity so let's do it and take it to

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:38,089
the next level and since then we have

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:42,710
been trying to do the activities in

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:45,320
chennai pie in a big way and we run

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:48,710
every meet up as if it were a mini or

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:55,940
micro conference so that's the care we

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:59,930
take and running each meet up so if you

00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:03,800
want to talk more about this I we have

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:07,220
an open space discussion that's a cell

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:10,339
for discussing Python community

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:15,740
activities we probably meet over there

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:18,080
and discuss more detail so thanks

00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:23,839

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:29,420

to the next level thank you thank you

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:38,900
Vijay for that brief note let me give a

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,200
big hand to dr rajakumar our keynote

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:47,380
speaker for today welcoming dr. raja to

the stage and good morning everybody

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:53,209
first of all let me thank the organizers

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:57,320
for calling me for this they also

00:09:53,209 --> 00:10:00,620
congratulate Vijay for the award see

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,480
generally what happens is when people

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,820
are working very well and doing some

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,550
cutting-edge contributions then they are

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,589
invited no present peppers and after

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,200
that stage when they are not doing

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:14,720
something substantial then you give a

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,170
general talk right that's when you grow

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,010
old

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:23,620
so that's my role today and put myself I

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,500
have been using Python and somewhat

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,449
fascinated and I have been trying to do

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,060
the job of a postman most of the time

00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:33,370
take the Python development taking it to

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,320
schools and colleges and mostly focusing

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,709
on science education because that is

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,810
where I make a living so I will just

00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:44,470
talk about everyone knows about the

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:46,420
history of computer education it all

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,170
started with the proliferation of IBM

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:53,199
pcs the clones basically IBM PC clones

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:54,880
somewhere starter in 83 and in 90 we had

00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:57,570
the multimedia pc is opening another

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,480
avenue a lot of education software came

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:03,370
and initially it was like learning

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,160
something new that was the machine

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:09,220
itself person you so teaching computers

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,410
means learning the operating system the

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,690
concept of files directory what so

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,399
things didn't really have a use in

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,300
itself but also learning the technology

00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:21,459
and a must-do a COS and we had of

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,110
applications like i don't think many of

00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:25,300
you have seen it word star and some

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,480
thoughtless 12 especially than other

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,220
things and this condition my first

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,060
exposure with some a group of school

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:37,149
students it was in 97 he was in a

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,850
vacation after the you know 10 standard

00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:42,550
exam we are some hundred students in

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:46,839
groups we trained them and what i notice

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:50,589
to us after 2-3 weeks you know several

00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,839
sessions they learn the basics and they

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,760
also were introduced to basic programs

00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,329
that I'm basic language was part of it

00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,160
and the students were I mean I was quite

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:02,319
surprised they were very quickly

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,810
catching up with the logics a drawing

00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:06,310
circles or maybe writing a program for

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,860
writing a multiplication table or such

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,360
things so I had a feeling okay things

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,029
are going in the right direction because

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,949
there is a useful tool then things

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:19,569
changed for the worse it is my personal

00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:22,060
view office software is branded as

00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:23,230
educational software you started

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,699
creeping and I will give you a demo

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,370
suppose you want to teach I want to

00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:29,320
teach you the number system 1 2 3 4 so

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:34,870
this is a magic good way of

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:40,930
doing it see one right this is how you

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:43,540
teach using PowerPoint I have a strong

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,390
doubt these programmers are inspired by

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:51,580
something else it comes from here there

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:56,200
anywhere dot so then we became the

00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:58,240
victims of blot where and I am myself a

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:03,430
personal personally I'm a victim of that

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:06,520
in 95 I had a 386 machine and the only

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,500
word processing I did was replying to

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,160
communications come from other people

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:14,110
they come as dot do see files what

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,320
happened is this cipher I remember

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:19,270
clearly then I got the message and I try

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,820
to open the file this require the next

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:25,420
version of that particular software to

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:28,330
read that document so that is always

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:31,810
like pre-planned so then i bought the

00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:33,790
next version of that of his package try

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,410
to install it it told it needs the

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,890
higher version of the operating system

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,930
that is Windows 95 and he was working in

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,390
a rich organization spending public

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,300
money so it was no issue he authorized

00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,160
an intense meter signature by that the

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:53,080
next Adam is telling that next to us it

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,960
told it needs a 486 not a 386 total cost

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,360
was around 1.2 lags or something and I

00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:02,530
still have not figured out why I had to

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,650
spend that money so it was not I was not

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:08,590
alone the entire thing was driven to you

00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:11,430
know more and more powerful hardware and

00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:14,380
all we were doing is word processing and

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,920
powerpoint presentation I would normally

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:21,190
say powerless and pointless things and

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,930
this somewhere and in between there are

00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:26,800
some good multimedia programs of course

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:29,310
but mostly they were making a TV but

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,990
here what is the relevance of Python

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,580
what we have to do is for we have to

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,660
really define what is the role of

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,370
computers in education should be taught

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,350
for enhancing the quality of education

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,120
or something just to introduce something

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,350
new

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,420
we should talk about computer-aided

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,660
education not just teaching computers

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:53,640
right it should be a tool to learn core

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,640
subjects suppose we go with that concept

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,270
say Python I am just see there are

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,430
enormous number of application i am not

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,920
even aware of pathan Seaver base things

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,410
but here in science actually we'd used

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,760
say applied mathematics they are asking

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,190
that whatever thrown in that yellow I

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,870
take some special interest that is

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,960
experimental data aggression and control

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,840
you connected it to hardware and do real

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:20,380
experiments so these are pythons basic

00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:24,880
capabilities and suppose if you take it

00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:27,130
to lowest levels schools schools need

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,630
teach the basic physics this everyone

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:33,180
knows that s is equal to f UT square

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:35,290
this linear motion as the equations and

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,670
textbooks if you go through that you

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,820
will find the equations and the graphs

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:42,520
printed it is a matter of writing two or

00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,260
three lines of Python code you really

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,770
understand how that graphs are coming

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,180
and you can change the parameters and it

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,860
gives a better understanding to the

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,600
subject which you are learning whether

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:58,150
it is mathematics physics chemistry on

00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:00,880
anything and on this front when I was

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:03,730
trying to look for resources what I find

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,010
is a lot of good programs Envy Python

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,800
and other things simulations are there

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,890
on the net and a lot of material to

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,190
teach Python but I didn't find much

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:18,880
material which is only say 10 or 20

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:23,320
lines of code that will you know help

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,180
you to learn these subjects one probable

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,210
solution is like an Indian context if

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,010
I'm talking take all this plus one plus

00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,410
two or ten standard textbooks and we

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,930
should try to have Python companion

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,060
books for that recall the exercises

00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,410
graphs everything small small I mean the

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,780
upper limit of the court should be

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,970
something 15 or 20 lines nothing more

00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,410
than that should be accepted because

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,500
then it becomes say you know a

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,170
programmers job I mean without becoming

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,650
a programmer how to utilize the power of

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,940
Python slightly advanced level anyway

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,940
this is not that

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:01,030
wants to example have taken when I go to

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,990
colleges people doing MSC or you know

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:07,380
even research thing mostly they need is

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:10,390
tools to manipulate big matrices

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,650
generate some graphics and do operations

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,230
like integration different this i have

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,730
taken I this output you see this from

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,860
the website I have taken so to our

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,140
circuits it's a special something to

00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:23,350
study chaos and there is a matlab

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,720
simulation output I just rewrote a small

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,400
code in Python this is the output so the

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,150
Ray areas people use matlab and

00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,880
mathematica they probably need some help

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,100
to get them into Python and these are

00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,900
also interesting fields I mean learn

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:42,610
something new okay this don't worry this

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,620
is where I use at least Python for

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:50,080
simple things like this is a accelerator

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,270
cavity small accelerating gaps you apply

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,560
voltages and you see how the energy of

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:56,080
particle increases this is a small

00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,790
Python code which there are other

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,410
programs complicated things we use

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:03,580
simulation programs but just to do a

00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:06,700
quick checking I still use Python and

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,520
now I am coming to an area where I just

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,470
do something that is the actual science

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,960
experiments there you need a hardware

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:17,500
you have to connect something to Vijay

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,750
also working similar things is it so you

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,580
have to have external hardware then you

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,640
are to have some real time control and

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,470
data acquisition so this was achieved by

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,270
combining a microcontroller at the pc so

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:31,060
you run c program or assembler on a

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,650
microcontroller python on a pc and they

00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,650
communicate it is a job division

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:37,180
actually all real time jobs go here all

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,350
processing and graphics with python the

00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,530
strong point of python and

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,910
microcontroller both are utilized so

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,230
then this already last year does

00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,090
presenter has just skip through that

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,220
this equipment you can see that on the

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:52,030
web details are there so this was a

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:54,850
first attempt to make a lock in a very

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,950
low cost tool available in this area you

00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:01,330
can see that some experiment running is

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:03,940
another one this is another one just

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,660
drop something to floor and you measure

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,300
the time of flight you can see here

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,610
a metal ball here it just falls to

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,220
ground and generates a vibration the box

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:16,870
times it actually it measures time with

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:20,060
a fraction of a millisecond resolution

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:23,480
anyway this is you can find an XY sort

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,740
in details are there and this project

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,630
actually it is also growing by a

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,270
community support last year google

00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,480
Summer of Code I mean praveen got some

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:35,000
support he did some work this is another

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,680
one because that whatever I showed you

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,330
is a first level and this is next one

00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,800
you will find it is hecka dead otay you

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,800
a Python powered scientific

00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,450
instrumentation tool and not doing it it

00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,910
is much more complex and more accurate

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:55,520
than what i have done still uses python

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:57,110
and microcontrollers and in a different

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,910
manner i call it as next generation

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,350
software because my son is doing it so

00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:04,730
there is no other way it is next

00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:11,120
generation software so again coming back

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:15,470
to our main topic like how we can

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,980
utilize python what is the advantage so

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,480
again we try to define how Python should

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,360
be used in a school or college

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,000
environment the present situation where

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,760
ever you go you find conventional pcs

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,350
maybe taking under words power and India

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:36,700
everywhere you will find a big UPS

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:36,700
system and what they do word processing

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,220
I mean like is our requirements you can

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,870
see we're processing general we teach

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,080
and some programming languages

00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:52,289
scientific computation simulations so

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,830
you add anything to that list do we

00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:59,130
really need a power-hungry processor for

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:01,470
that what I've seen is if you take a

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:04,830
small arm processor board plus a monitor

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:07,230
most of these jobs are done and at

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,600
present Raspberry Pi the second version

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,830
seems to be a good candidate for the I

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:17,070
did some tests on that comparing it and

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:20,279
it's here this screen screen shortage

00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:22,380
from Raspberry Pi Here I am running say

00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,320
X pies it is connected to the hardware

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,750
and constantly updating the graph some

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,210
simulation outputs and this one I am

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,309
able to you know use it this I didn't

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,250
expect to us the Maya V the 3d rendering

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:38,970
that also it is handling reasonably

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:42,210
smooth and this also you can use other

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,830
arm boards with 1 gb rom like cubieboard

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,080
Mars board there are many options are

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,270
there but trust Mara pie is much better

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:54,169
considering their support and no user

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:57,090
base and also one can think of designing

00:21:54,169 --> 00:22:00,390
one hour on this is something i did but

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:02,429
i failed miserably that is because i

00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,409
didn't help maybe that much exposure to

00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:06,840
that we made a board with all the

00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:09,059
specifications got it fabricated but

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,760
somehow it did not work and it was all

00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:14,669
done using again open source eda tools

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,149
like I care you can do schematic you

00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:19,590
know PCB layout everything in that this

00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:21,330
is a project probably some good

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,340
engineers can take up and you know make

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,770
a number like raspberry pi and you know

00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,299
we can have something local also because

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,370
the component costs are only ten to

00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:32,510
fifteen dollars those processors are

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,510
very cheap nowadays

00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:38,690
now I will just talk some of my personal

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,100
experiences where I started as I told

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,720
you this is the problem and you call old

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:49,639
people let's talk about the past so I

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:52,190
got into this I mean Python why are the

00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:56,899
linux root the free of free software so

00:22:52,190 --> 00:23:00,320
94 i was using him a dose before that

00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:03,350
and that windows 3.1 was there sitting

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,059
on those and i wanted to have a

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,490
multi-user system which supports

00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:10,369
networking everything and that's the

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,850
point i came across linux for the first

00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:16,850
time and it was available on three

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:19,039
floppies and kernel version in 94 was

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:22,399
fibrillary was less than 1.9 and

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:25,610
something and surprisingly everything

00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:27,799
works very well for me writing a device

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,230
driver and writing networking graphics

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:31,759
code everything a lot of information so

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,590
that's where I first I realized that

00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:37,429
community support how important it was

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:39,679
and inspired by that and I thought if it

00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:42,619
is very useful for me because running a

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,929
machine and if something which runs 24

00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:47,889
hours 365 days a particle accelerator we

00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:55,369
run on a network some 20 Linux machines

00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:58,519
and so 2001a thought we will just go to

00:23:55,369 --> 00:24:02,720
schools and try to push the free

00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:04,850
software idea and this project there are

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,619
lot of people FSF india's trivandrum

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,200
finally the ITA school project of kerala

00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:11,240
it started on proprietary and shifted

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,519
hundred percent to free software that

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,440
time mostly I was promoting terminal

00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,090
servers so that you can have reduced

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,369
hardware cause it is no more relevant at

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:28,190
the moment how do we are already cheaper

00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:30,049
then around 2005 got into this computer

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,269
interface science experiments one reason

00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:33,889
is i realized that i cannot write good

00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:36,409
software so why not combine it with the

00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:39,590
hardware has you have some something

00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:41,629
different so made some devices a pearpod

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,350
device and it is all cords that is only

00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:45,980
language that I was comfortable 87

00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,010
onwards I was

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,510
using see everything was written in C

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,760
and the project was released then

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:56,000
somebody else came and he wrote a paper

00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,610
here in Linux Gazette in 2005 so this

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,919
file lines so this you can see the same

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:04,600
thing a relay and metal ball and rail or

00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,980
speaker measured that time of flight and

00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,799
published it here is promoted a

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,169
registered at he didn't come and that

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,240
point I thought I had to learn Python so

00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:20,900
that is 2004 so my person is not very

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:23,750
old and after that I have been going

00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:26,179
with Python mostly to science teachers

00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,299
and colleges and schools so every year

00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:30,770
at the University accelerator center we

00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:34,309
conduct training programs for teacher

00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:36,710
six day training for physics teachers so

00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:40,370
conducted are around 20 programs like

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:42,650
that and also go around and conduct one

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:45,740
day workshops that include sexually free

00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:48,140
software relax Python LX wise and also

00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:51,110
not a small book that is for BSC maths

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:54,200
people of cali university this one again

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,179
our internal use since i was using

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,419
python for the other thing i realized

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:01,610
that it is useful for my Mary area of

00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:05,299
work also like you can see these three

00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:07,460
lines of code capable of controlling or

00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:09,559
you know monitoring any parameters in

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,530
our particle accelerator so there is

00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,380
library hidden so that helped actually

00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:17,480
people the developers of accelerators

00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,700
and users who are not familiar with

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,809
programming to quickly get something

00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:29,360
done and all it goes on the tcp/ip

00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:32,179
network and this i am not giving much

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,240
detail you can get it much better from

00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:37,070
the web if you take any field of science

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,220
there are large number of packages

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:42,400
available on the web so I thought I'll

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:45,080
not really you know explain them and

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,150
most of them is really actually

00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,030
leveraging on the scientific computation

00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:53,600
and the graphics capabilities of right

00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:55,750
like scifi matplotlib Maya V and all

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,750
those

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,510
now I will talk about some grievances

00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:06,620
right so I see whether I can get some

00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:08,360
minnow support on that I generally go

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,760
with a bootable pendrive so yesterday

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,400
also i talked to a group of teachers

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:17,090
some 25 30 people so they bring their

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:20,900
laptops and to run the show i have to

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:23,360
install this XY software a lot of other

00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,980
same at lot leben sie po numpy very so

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,990
is the easiest thing is to take a

00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,690
bootable media app and drive or a CD and

00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:34,490
the participants laptops we boot from

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:37,190
that and from the show and then I

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,620
realized now there are some new problems

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,540
this is old ones he initially in in 90s

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,940
the problem which we faced when going to

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,620
free software was some network drivers

00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,770
printers these things were not available

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:52,010
and there were x window graphics were

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:53,750
small and very slow and there were less

00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,309
number of applications even the

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,460
openoffice came later earlier it was

00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:01,460
tariff isn't that hard ellis in the past

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,410
it was over but the new ones came

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,260
actually so now what we are facing is

00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:09,530
the new hurdles that cartoon you might

00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:13,250
have seen so every time when i go to a

00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:15,740
place and people come say maybe somebody

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:19,400
say last year this last month also had a

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,880
programs and twenty people around 17 18

00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:25,340
laptops two of them i could not boot

00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:29,840
because you cannot disable that booth

00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:33,410
that secure people that booth is very

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:38,270
dangerous so finally that laptop could

00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:41,330
not be used so then I tell them before

00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:43,190
you pay your money at least you make

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,870
sure that you can run the OS what you

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,750
want the other cartoon anyway you know

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:51,760
how it makes you secure right tie the

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,760
laces together you are very safe and

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:56,330
technical support you know some type of

00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:00,470
some support is very easy to get on the

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:03,290
net see when I realized all these things

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:05,059
I am having some business ideas since

00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,650
all this if suppose had this right when

00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:07,320
I conduct the training program the two

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,940
will become

00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,030
d then I will not be able to conduct any

00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,790
training programs right so then I

00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:18,570
thought yesterday only this slide was

00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:20,460
added because after that program why not

00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,050
enter business everybody is entering

00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,360
into business right so I thought I will

00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,430
set up a crockery shop forget about this

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,030
film is taking place not my mother

00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:32,490
tongue so I call it as my crockery shop

00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:36,720
so the deal is you pay the price of a

00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:39,930
one good ceramic mug cup what you get is

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,450
a disposable plastic cup and I will give

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:44,130
you a seller type free because when the

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:47,730
cup get stone you can repair it with

00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:49,620
fellow take an investment partner you

00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:53,460
told some 500 companies are there right

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,290
so I hope somebody with and now you may

00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,110
be thinking nobody will buy that right

00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:00,750
so this idea is no good for this money

00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,910
nobody is going to pay that you are

00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:06,000
wrong I here at least hundred people I'd

00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:08,640
find because there are people who pay

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,640
for a noise and accept a pre-installed

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,160
with the recovery CD right they do not

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,660
get an installable media so that they

00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,370
can wipe out their hardware and they are

00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,500
initially today so that kind of people

00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:23,480
are and thinking by potential customers

00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:27,360
I hope now I have some investment

00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:34,190
partners coming up so the message is

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:37,050
probably we have to keep our freedom so

00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:41,640
so probably I could say I like to

00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:44,970
emphasize on two points one is Python

00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:48,180
gives us a different kind of power in

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:50,640
the field of education that is you can

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,030
redefine the requirement and even your

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,940
hardware requirements are becoming

00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:59,280
smaller think of a lab where you could

00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,010
say some are machines like raspberry pi

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,280
set and out 20 of them each call there's

00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:08,670
five plus 15 something rectory watts and

00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:12,270
put a big battery and a solar panel so

00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:14,280
it's it's going to be very economic and

00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,980
environment-friendly and it will do I

00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,500
mean as far as I can see it can do all

00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,990
your needs teaching programming or

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,270
itching

00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,730
science or any other thing you do not

00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:28,059
have to really keep on investing on

00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:32,920
hardware and that and running also saw

00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:35,020
few unwanted software so that means you

00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:41,710
can increase the efficiency of the

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:45,130
overall system and another thing is C

00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:48,700
Python why I'm standing here is it is an

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:51,460
open source to suppose if there is a vb

00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,750
korn even if it is much better than

00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,000
Python pro day I wouldn't have come

00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,850
because it's you know the technical

00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,200
capability is it not the only criteria

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,030
because you are in an open source

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:07,870
environment what you that is what you

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:10,540
prefer right so there also we have to

00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:17,020
see whether we are able to preserve that

00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:19,330
freedom like the freedom to buy the

00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:22,780
hardware you like and the freedom to run

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:27,420
the OS of your preference if there is

00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:37,380
any empty string one should realize that

00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:37,380
and that's all i have to say thank you

00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:49,990
any audience any member from the

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:55,300
audience wants to ask something anyone

00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:57,910
who wants to ask no one okay so there's

00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,650
one candidate vacation right is it

00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,570
prominent in any other countries I mean

00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,640
is there a initiative taken by other

00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:06,190
countries are like we are the past okay

00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,320
see that way you are talking about this

00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,740
just the Python it is see the Raspberry

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,770
Pi itself is running you worldwide right

00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,410
means every machine is going with python

00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:21,910
and the stuff which I was talking about

00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:23,560
that expires kit that around twenty-five

00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:27,040
percent of her that has been sold

00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:30,070
outside India firstly in Europe France

00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,740
is there and Canada USA so there some

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,720
export market is there but basically it

00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,400
is not moving that faster because we do

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,780
not have that kind of marketing the

00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,980
people who are making it just

00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,750
enterpreneurs I mean they are not

00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:43,300
marketing it really they are just

00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:45,610
selling it so this Python right i mean

00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,440
like is it because just the hardware

00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:50,920
costs that you are talking about are

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:54,580
there any specific advantage types of

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:57,940
education in learning the single in HP

00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:00,040
yes yes s CI I didn't probably just

00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,780
since you asked that question for

00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,910
example maybe matlab looks like no

00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:09,340
tempting to like yeah right storing

00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:11,230
slather than fighting right right so you

00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,300
are so let me just see see this is the

00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,760
desktop which i put on the bootable

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:20,220
pendrive and i don't normally go with a

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:23,320
book and also there is a small program

00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:25,770
which is a cod browser i'll just put it

00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,770
there and

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:37,000
see there are small programs learning

00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:38,830
something it gives the output here there

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,800
are so many other reserve if we talk

00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:45,520
about science say I take physics say

00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:48,820
mechanics a simple mass and spring

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,890
problem that we do in the very basic

00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,320
classes and these sort of things I find

00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:56,250
Python so you see this only hardly 10 to

00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,780
20 lines of code which shows you that

00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,090
know how to run that simulation and I

00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,730
don't see any other language that Turner

00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:05,680
like Fortran C or anything they can do

00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,870
it 30 c then matlab of course the

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,840
proprietary nature the cost everything

00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:13,420
matters so python i find for teaching

00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,980
science it has very good potential

00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,510
school level especially the first few

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:20,290
and all because most of the time what do

00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:23,380
you mug up like you suppose say you see

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:25,960
an equation a complex equation when you

00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:30,660
really see it in action you get a better

00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:37,270
idea so just just will take a very small

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:40,780
t here say here this one plot r is equal

00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:43,420
to cos k theta right in python it is

00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,340
only four lines of code it gives a graph

00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,590
like this suppose my intention is to

00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:50,770
explore this equation its behavior not

00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:55,270
learning python I make it for us 4.4 I

00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:57,580
get it like this so then you are G your

00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:00,160
intention is to explore the mathematical

00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,050
equation and it looks dull when it is

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,140
written like this but when you see the

00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:08,800
plot it is you know it's something

00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:12,820
different say here another small

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,300
equation here I'll just run it it uses

00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,300
Maya v

00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:23,069
I have it takes a bit of time loading

00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,979
see this is the same picture you are

00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:27,779
seen in your chemistry textbooks right

00:36:24,979 --> 00:36:30,179
that p orbital or something in 12 stand

00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:32,309
or even 10 standard just solving an

00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:34,829
equation and the function is that

00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:39,390
spherical harmonics display so all these

00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:42,479
things if I try to or if you want more

00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:45,359
entertainment say make a fractal and all

00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:47,640
these programs are always now I do not

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,499
write big programs here this all maxi we

00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,609
can do it into near is or something like

00:36:49,499 --> 00:37:00,199
that and that that I see as a real you

00:36:53,609 --> 00:37:00,199
know advantage and if you just

00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,900
these are other animations again

00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:10,420
matplotlib and you know this is again a

00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:15,579
small you know study on the scavo's

00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:17,589
floral systems and this people mostly do

00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:19,420
these things i knows or working in this

00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:22,210
area mostly people are using matlab at

00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,539
the moment and adjusting telling some

00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:27,220
other at least you know convert it into

00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:34,809
Python give a try so you are not worried

00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:36,789
about licensing anymore after that so

00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:39,549
this another one next actually then

00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:41,950
again studying the neurons you know some

00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:44,109
equations you have put and see how this

00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:45,880
what the phenomena called amplitude that

00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:48,880
another who don't ask me too much i am

00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,119
not a biologist but i just take their

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,799
equations and try to write the code and

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,690
tell them to just see you at it it's

00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:57,759
useful and this this i find it's quite

00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:02,079
easy because this is the actually some

00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:06,009
of the equation so that I think it is

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,829
true in any field of education you can

00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:10,809
you can easily learn that maybe i will

00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:12,339
end with the CD the argument is always

00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:16,349
there which language is better maybe

00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:19,390
i'll end with a story it's somewhat i

00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:22,569
believe in in our language there is a

00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:25,059
saying as a story about that you must be

00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:29,289
knowing that is a hermit who are the rad

00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:31,450
problem in his Hermitage so ratman is

00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:35,470
finally somebody asked he advise you

00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:38,200
keep a cat so cat will catch the mouse

00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:40,809
and you will be peaceful here where'd

00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,690
that then the problem was here to feed

00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:46,569
the cat my milk is naked he has to keep

00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:49,480
a cow for that then finally you know he

00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:53,619
finally married and settled as a so his

00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:56,349
original way of life was lost normally I

00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:58,119
say when a physicist or mathematician if

00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:00,730
you are getting into programming you

00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:03,640
have to be careful you should stay with

00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:05,289
your subject if you go with C and you

00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,609
will solve the problem by the time you

00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:09,430
solve your problem you have become a

00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:11,529
programmer rather than a fee system your

00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:14,259
focus of attention will drift ibid

00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:16,809
Python with our seen that will not

00:39:14,259 --> 00:39:17,230
happen because you stay focused on your

00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:20,440
sub

00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:23,200
and learning python come in that effort

00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,970
is very very minimal and that's where I

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,560
prefer you know I that there is only

00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,780
them it's a personal belief problem may

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,060
be wrong and with that belief only I

00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:34,150
just go and tell people okay this switch

00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:39,150
over to python start using it any other

00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:50,920
questions I have one more question yeah

00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:53,260
yeah python is used to for work you yeah

00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,350
sorry i ah my name is Venkat I'm just

00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:58,869
curious to know why python has been used

00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:01,840
for developing the YouTube application

00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:04,990
other than it is open source is there

00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,060
any advantage from technical point of

00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,650
view know that I think some experts here

00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,869
will tell you because that web

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,690
programming using Python I know it is

00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:15,850
very see more video intensive

00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:19,119
application youtube has here everybody

00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:21,640
knows so that only that somebody who is

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:26,230
programming in that you know area can

00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:29,410
tell like why it is you know that maybe

00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:32,760
somebody else cancer versus another you

00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,760
want we can answer their question

00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,050
this on ok so i had the same question to

00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,210
him you know when I stood there like two

00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:52,060
years back which was actually like an

00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:54,580
impact on us at that time so the answer

00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:58,540
was that actual processing is done in

00:40:54,580 --> 00:41:00,280
C++ and Python is used in the API for

00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:03,280
from the front end to the back end ok

00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,370
because it it's amazing as a AP I you

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,050
know language it's like a glue language

00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:11,230
both in terms of if you want to use it

00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:12,580
as a glue for connecting see to python

00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,320
this is what some of the scientific

00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,820
things do that is one way of using it as

00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,590
a clue language another is as an EPA

00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:24,640
language so that's what python is used

00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:26,380
for not for any you know processing can

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,720
we take it offline we'll I'm happy to

00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,060
talk about it later any other question

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,820
so I'll add something to that now since

00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,440
and I'm told that this is what he told

00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,210
is true for all the scientific

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,610
amputation or when I talk about all

00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:42,940
these integration or matrix manipulation

00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:46,420
than by Python it's all old Fortran

00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:51,640
libraries or C libraries just soloed by

00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:53,920
python that is that is the fact you

00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,760
studied first of all fantastic effort

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,440
big I know hand for that you I just had

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,210
a couple of questions one and maybe one

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,500
suggestion one is that is there a

00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:08,290
community in trying to help teach Python

00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,450
tickets to for you know learning science

00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:12,700
and math and stuff like that is there a

00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,530
community effort that's either part of

00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,290
Python groups or something else that you

00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,750
are aware of for c1 by high 81 before

00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:22,600
see group is there okay programs and

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:25,090
runs and it's an active community in

00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,710
this uncertainty okay there's one second

00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:30,430
thing is that it will be great if you

00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,900
can do one open space with people who

00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,550
are that is probably where you can

00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,690
you're going to get a lot of health you

00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,550
mentioned that there are some packages

00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,350
that cannot be marketed in stuff like

00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,180
that they're also probably a lot of

00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:42,250
entrepreneurs here who may be interested

00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:45,010
in getting involved so my request to you

00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:47,410
is maybe in open space you can set up

00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:49,560
like a 15 minute 30 minutes lot and I

00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:52,270
will be happy to come down and you know

00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,000
discuss how we can help after this we

00:42:52,270 --> 00:43:00,270
can talk yeah thank you

00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,880
I have one more question so if we see

00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:05,340
countries like us UK France Australia

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,660
and some European countries most of them

00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,690
are using Python as a primary

00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:11,040
programming language in India even for

00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,720
engineering students we have still

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,420
teaching c language as the primary

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,940
language do you have anything no comment

00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,040
on that I can only answer in terms of

00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,840
physics you know physics not take it

00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,240
very seriously he thinks he has a

00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,920
concept called inertia suppose he I

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,800
cannot push this because I seen as a

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,530
heavy but a small laptop I am able to

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,110
push right India is a big country now we

00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:44,460
call it a very huge country and we have

00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:48,360
huge inertia water so we do not change

00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:50,490
fast actually what happened is Fortran

00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,910
was initially taught in schools and

00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:55,710
colleges because most of the if you see

00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:58,320
the history in 80's when the computer

00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,200
labs were set up in all universities it

00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,820
was done by either physics people or

00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,280
mass people though there was no computer

00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:08,730
science as such at that time in 80's he

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,520
was collected also i know so they were

00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:15,500
comfortable with fortran then industry

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,090
was more with you know C C++ so finally

00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:21,530
for I am talking about school education

00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:25,020
whatever the cbse allowed they put C++

00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:27,360
but they never realized that this c++ is

00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,400
as a separate compartment and it never

00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,250
interacted with the other PCM physics

00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,840
chemistry maths so it was parallel track

00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:39,960
and the only reason was those who

00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:42,870
introduced the language did not have any

00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,000
you know aim in mind just teach students

00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,500
one programming language maybe in future

00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,170
it will be useful to them that is what

00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,540
but with Python it is the it is a

00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:53,220
different thing you want to see this

00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,290
three things are going physics chemistry

00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:58,320
maths or other whatever this should

00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,760
support the other three and cbse finally

00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,960
they have realized that the higher up

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,090
and last you last year now for you know

00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,510
plus 1 and plus 2 you have an option to

00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,120
take c plus

00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:11,890
Python but it is it is an opportunity

00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,610
but what is really happening is no

00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:18,490
schools are is an option school wise and

00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:20,140
school can choose these were that and I

00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,850
have not seen any school actually

00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:25,000
switching over to python because they

00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:26,890
are mainly again inertia to some extent

00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,720
and they are a bit afraid also will

00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,790
support so our Python communities

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,760
probably the service we can do is

00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:35,560
approach these schools and see whether

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,540
you can give some support and at least

00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,760
pursue them to switch over so that is

00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:41,470
the long run things will happen also

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:50,590
tell them Python also has good job

00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:54,820
opportunities that is thank you hi I

00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:57,430
have a question so the thing is that you

00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,470
said the Python for education class 10

00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:00,790
11 12 you mentioned that physics

00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:02,980
equations can be translated into

00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:04,900
programs and you can see the simulation

00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,880
and visualize it or not so is there any

00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,820
work going on in that field like heavy

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,530
done song see I do a little bit but if

00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:13,900
you see on the internet many people are

00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:15,700
doing is like if you take the Python we

00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,230
should be Python site and a lot of

00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,970
simulation but what I find AC

00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:22,600
programmers have it and then see

00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:24,880
sometimes make it too fancy right you

00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,310
write a code it is fine lines it is

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,050
doing the job but then we add bells and

00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,700
whistles and make it underlines nobody

00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:34,420
else understand that so that is the only

00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:36,610
trouble i see so what we see is give the

00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,290
core thing these fine lines and tell you

00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:40,960
know students know you do whatever you

00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:42,820
want so what I was telling is a lot of

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,690
programs and lot of literature to teach

00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:49,380
Python but we need small fragments say

00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,970
maybe 10 lines 50 lines fine lines and

00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,000
just plot an equation so that at that

00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:56,980
point the confidence also is very high

00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,440
you see their thing okay two lines I can

00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:02,710
easily learn and one thing that is that

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,930
will vanish is I know how this at least

00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:08,920
be a CMA sea level they are teaching C

00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:10,510
C++ and students just mug up these so

00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,240
they know there are 10 programs they

00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:15,370
have to learn that we asked in the exam

00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,150
they just muck it up including semicolon

00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:19,760
and colon

00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:28,700
and Python the trouble is there is no

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:30,680
semicolon tomography so that that's a

00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,600
big desired Avenger those who want to

00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,210
really mug up something there is nothing

00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,310
so I normally when I give elementary

00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:39,380
Python talk I will tell them only thing

00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:41,630
to remember is if there is a block

00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:44,000
indentation before Indian day to block a

00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:45,710
colon if you can remember that myth

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,650
somehow you are through right I mean

00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:51,500
that's a feeling I got i also told have

00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:53,750
that much experience in python is only

00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:58,850
10 year old python that to force by

00:47:53,750 --> 00:48:01,450
promote one last thing so things you

00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:03,860
said that you are also working with

00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:06,260
particle accelerators so i just want to

00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:07,640
know like which team you are working

00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,200
with and what exactly are the

00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:12,460
experiments what kind of experiments are

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:16,160
you doing ah that i don't know how this

00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:18,650
okay actually I tell you women be I work

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,780
in a particle accelerator lab that is

00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:23,390
the first lab established for indian

00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:26,450
universities in 1984 it was established

00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:29,690
because Indian Universities did not have

00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:32,150
a particle accelerator for this so ugc

00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:33,590
thought it is better and now University

00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:36,260
can afford to have it on their own

00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:38,450
because hundreds of crores investment so

00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:42,230
initially we started with a 16 million

00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:45,680
volt at Aunt Em accelerator and that was

00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:47,780
started the 90 started operating and

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,910
then we started working on a super

00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,550
kinetically linear accelerators and that

00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:54,140
is commissioned five years back now

00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:57,290
presently I am involved in another

00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:59,300
linear accelerator rest design so these

00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:01,970
are basically we do mostly the design

00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,320
development and maintenance and see even

00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:06,320
that kid to what I was talking about

00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:08,570
this a by-product of this because I 87 I

00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,250
got into accelerator control system

00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,410
there you are having hundreds of

00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:15,190
parameters interface to computer here

00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:17,390
you reduced into small box with 10 or 15

00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,620
otherwise the accelerator usage is

00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:20,150
mainly in nuclear physics material

00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:24,790
science events a pure physics

00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:24,790
fundamental this is only what is

00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:32,280
yeah one last question anybody has any

00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:39,660
last anymore last questions left one

00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:43,470
more question on top hello yeah thank

00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:46,470
you so much so my question is again the

00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:48,630
connectivity in India meaning spreading

00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,220
the information is much harder than say

00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,690
in u.s. or somewhere where you know

00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,400
internet access is much more accessible

00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,960
and also you have I think education

00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,630
distribution channels also which are

00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,540
much better probably than in India can

00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:04,050
we do something on that friend to better

00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:06,300
the I mean so i guess if can you

00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:08,370
probably do online courses i mean

00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,600
courses that are recorded and maybe then

00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:11,790
it can be passed on you know just like

00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,430
as you are sharing the pendrive maybe

00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:16,200
pass on you know pen drive with courses

00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:18,180
of how to go about these things because

00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,730
i think even there's a fundamental

00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:22,170
problem that is the way things are

00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,240
taught is not from conceptual

00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:26,340
understanding of things that but from a

00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,560
mugging a point of view how much ever we

00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:30,180
might try to change that at the lowest

00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,250
level it will still be quite hard to

00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,840
change that attitude so even if you push

00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,880
python it will Python will be the new

00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,740
thing that you get mucked up so i feel

00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,810
if we can have a mechanism by which

00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,120
people who are enthusiastic come collect

00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:44,220
videos and inspirations of you know how

00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,840
it's used in industry also maybe and

00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,340
then you know push it through channels

00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,800
that we have access to it in like yours

00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:53,010
or other ones i feel that might reach

00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:55,140
people the right people with the same i

00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:56,610
own enthusiasm and which might i think

00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:58,860
make a slightly better difference i

00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:01,620
would like to know your question your

00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:03,540
thoughts on the same i think that way if

00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,760
you are looking i think our biggest to

00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:08,940
see we have to use the info existing

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:12,420
system right so that way the biggest

00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:15,960
rana is our schools and colleges so you

00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:20,010
see getting hundred guys together that

00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,720
is the best place and my personal views

00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:24,480
at the moment if you can resist talking

00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,340
into very contrary terms if we make a

00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,520
task force all the python enthusiasts

00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:32,640
and make something concrete okay we will

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:35,700
approach hundred schools offer them an

00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,920
initial initiation into python and also

00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,410
convince them how it is going to see

00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,930
that is all

00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:44,140
I was having a hammering on how it will

00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:46,210
help other subjects and they know c++

00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:48,789
does not help teaching other subjects at

00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:52,180
all and give a little bit of you know

00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:55,000
and holding will save for a while and

00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:58,059
then and the bootable media i find it is

00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,710
very useful because if you ask people ok

00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:02,319
install these that somewhere they get

00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:04,030
you know lost and then they have a

00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,559
problem but the other one within two

00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:09,730
minutes you are up and running and

00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:11,470
either a DVD or actually fossee project

00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:13,690
a program terms and also they used to

00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:16,240
give this sort of you know bootable dvds

00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,039
and now actually pen drives are much

00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,140
more easier so that but we have to

00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:22,990
approach schools and colleges at that's

00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:25,109
what my feeling that is where you know

00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:28,000
the potential customers are sitting

00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:31,270
thanks a lot for the insightful keynote

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,670
and the anecdotes dr. eyes it and thanks

00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:35,230
a lot for your questions if you want to

00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,309
speak to dr. Isaacs further you can you

00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:39,190
know catch him in the hallway or and

00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:41,460
open space so I think thanks a lot ok

00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,460
