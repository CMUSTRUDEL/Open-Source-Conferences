that I think we want to be you know an

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,250
e-commerce play you know we want to be

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,930
actually you know differentiated from

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,170
the existing players out in the market

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,560
and you know ecommerce as we know has

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,300
actually revolutionized the you know the

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,880
marketplace already right I think it's

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,580
created a new business model and you

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,620
know what we are gonna be doing here in

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,810
the e-commerce plays to bring in the

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,120
high political dimension to it right and

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,460
you know that changes a lot of equation

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,070
actually in our in our mind and and

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,350
that's the actually you know in my in my

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,090
opinion that's an inclusive model you

00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,680
know where you know the all of the

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,240
infrastructure are the problems that you

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,060
know the e-commerce companies trying to

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,670
you know solve like you know deliver in

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,310
a short time and you know and also take

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,600
care of the you know the price points

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,460
and you know discovery and all that I

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,440
think you know right now all of those

00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,120
sauce problems are solved by the local

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,950
forms that are physically present in

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,209
your neighborhood right those problems

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,670
are already solved right why don't want

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,010
to tap into that particular expertise

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,380
that they have already given so they

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,360
built a new e-commerce model which is an

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,270
inclusive model where I call it as an

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,310
Indian model of e-commerce to the where

00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,200
I think in India we have a strong local

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,880
connection with the with the

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,550
neighborhood that we live in right so

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,870
the local community so this picture kind

00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,550
of depicts that you know there are

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,800
stores in your neighborhood where you

00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,290
live and use a shop you know use your

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,910
phone to basically do shopping kind of

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,760
know what's good you know what's going

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,440
on there and it is basically offers you

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,970
convenience because you know I think in

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,800
today's world life if you're in

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,060
Bangalore you know you know how much of

00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,040
a traffic that we need to go through

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,320
navigate through to go to stores from in

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,850
a story a toy store be you know I said

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,770
hassle right I think you know we offer

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,290
the convenience where you know you could

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,459
you could look at the pricing of the

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,230
product particular product in a

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,550
different store and also you know what

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,370
kind of you know products that they have

00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,630
carry and 24 by 7 right I think you know

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,730
you don't have to worry about the store

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,710
store or ours anymore I think you know

00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,020
we can you know jump into the app and

00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,380
and probably you know take take that

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,610
convenience there

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,010
you know ecommerce have actually offered

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,350
to everybody right and you know the

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,150
third point is actually quite quite

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,460
interesting is that what I you know kind

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,640
of referred to in the initial in a

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,990
initial talk right social impact if you

00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,390
see that the neighborhood right I think

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,820
the the local forums now the local

00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,680
retailers they're you know they are

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,480
actually the what I call the lifeline of

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,450
the economy the local community economy

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,920
right they they basically give jobs in

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,900
the neighborhood and also the real

00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,480
estate that they occupy right so there's

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,800
a lot of social impact that we do that

00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,750
we are trying to bring in as well when

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,010
you when you shop from us it you are

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,150
actually shopping from one of those

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,100
stores that you know in your

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,450
neighborhood or in your city you know

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,130
it's going to be servicing your request

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,950
and you know that it's coming from them

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,500
and you know I'll talk about you know a

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,960
few aspects of the hyperlocal you know I

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,840
think the the you know the typical you

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,460
know the shopper right you know in the

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,530
traditional ways before e-commerce to go

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,720
from story ages to our week apart the

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,030
prices and understand what they what

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,430
they offer and then you know pick pick

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,810
another scrap you know because the the

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,280
products that the shoppers buy is kind

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,110
of like an investment that they make

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,090
because they're buying a TV or a home

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,410
appliance it's not it's not an impulsive

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,420
purchase you just like wake up in the

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,770
morning go and go online and buy it I

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,540
think there's a you know discovery

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,350
process which is a lengthy process in

00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,870
that a hyperlocal

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,430
you know the users have been used in a

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,380
traditional ways to go from shop a to

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,850
shop become part of prices and we're

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:55,260
gonna try and bring in all those aspects

00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:55,260
of its as as I hyperlocal you know facet

00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,880
so I say was also saying that you know

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,680
we are not about the impulsive purchases

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,150
where you just go and buy online and you

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,010
know forget about the for the

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,770
transaction is completed we we look at

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:11,050
the the whole lifecycle of that probably

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,520
no experience and you know product

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,470
discovery as I mentioned it's like you

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,790
know it's a mystery it depends upon the

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,080
product you just like know if you buy

00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,130
clothes probably just wake up in the

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,810
morning by it's a couple of t-shirts

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,449
that's fine but I think if you're buying

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,279
a TV or a home appliance like

00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,169
you know washing machines and then a

00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,400
refrigerator Silla it's a lengthy you

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,770
know process I think the discovery

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,870
process is very unique in hyperlocal and

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,309
you know and these are investments the

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,779
purchases are we look at this as

00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,150
investment start not like you know

00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:38,469
transactions right you know there's a

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,449
huge difference between investment a

00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:42,580
transaction so this investment need to

00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,740
be protected and this protection we be

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,360
going to be in not just protection but

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,650
also that covers under warranty and

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,120
services but also the delivery and

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,889
installation of these kind of products

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,419
is actually you know it's not simple

00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:55,029
right you need technicians come in and

00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:56,800
do that right so you know that the local

00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:58,180
connection basically you will buy it

00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,770
from a local store you know that that's

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,779
going to be taken care of or at least

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,300
you know that you can go and ask the

00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:05,469
particular person and say I want you

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,150
know this kind of services you know come

00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:08,499
and deliver it coming you know I'm right

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,759
now available just call up the guy and

00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:11,379
say you know do you want to come now and

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,580
they've come and do the you know

00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,839
installation and setup or whatever I

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,909
think that connection is very very

00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,009
unique in e-commerce you know you know

00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:20,860
in hyper local space which khichdi

00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,330
Commerce do not offer right and warranty

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,009
of services is basically this investment

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,649
need to be protected and warranties

00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:28,120
basically the the warranty given by the

00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:29,819
manufacturer but I think we have the

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,199
extent of warranty that covers you know

00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,969
beyond that period like two or three

00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,169
years period they were becoming

00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,779
introduced new products they're called

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:39,459
software assure that takes care of much

00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:41,020
of for your hassles going through your

00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,899
customer service support I'll talk about

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:48,069
that when I get get that get that slide

00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:49,839
later in the talk and and then the life

00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:52,569
cycle of the product basically you know

00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,339
it doesn't know it doesn't end with the

00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:55,599
services but also you know how do you

00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,800
recycle it and how do you

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,330
you know once it gets whole how do you

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,099
upgrade that to a new version so you

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,050
just need to exchange that you are

00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:03,879
different you know new products so we

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,649
also come in the local you know market

00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,209
you know local forms are already doing

00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:09,189
it retailer so we're gonna tap into that

00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:11,620
graph expertise as well and make sure

00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:13,719
that no exchanges are also taken care so

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,719
you get into a new part cycle over again

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:18,849
right so we look at the site local as so

00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:20,889
wholesome you know you know into an

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:23,259
ecosystem rather than a particular

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,939
particular segment office not not just

00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,620
delivery or not just you know discovery

00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:31,089
you look at it from end to end

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:33,279
perspective and product discovery I want

00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:35,199
to take the tool to or up that cycle

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,250
right product discovery is one of the

00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:38,710
biggest problem that

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,640
assault and second aspect of this as I

00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,409
mentioned about the warranty and

00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,380
services so I'm going to take to speak

00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,870
to two items and you know you know our

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,490
lead scientist your dude come in and you

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,970
know show some of the problems and how

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,160
they are solving it you know the the

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,220
challenge that we have here is very

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,380
unique because of the hyper local you

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,360
know aspect of it so we have sellers of

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,830
all different size sizes right knows

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,900
from they're organized they're

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,670
tech-savvy some of them you know some of

00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,990
them may not be you know I think we need

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,210
to build technology for all of them

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,460
because we are asset like category we

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,650
don't carry any kind of inventory

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,210
ourselves it's very easy for e-commerce

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,100
player to just have inventory how to

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,870
build a website and set it online right

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,030
I think we need to build inventory right

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,830
and it's inventory is going to be

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,320
different from a location to another

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,000
location right because what's what's

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,560
trending here what's being you know

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,270
bought over here and in this in this

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,850
area will be entirely different from

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,410
what's being born in Mumbai or Delhi for

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,440
example right I think you know that

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:40,870
local connection that local sort of you

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,490
know knowledge I think you know we need

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,330
to bring in when we talk about hyper

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,440
local and you know our biggest Pro

00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,060
challenges is to you know build

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,160
technology that works for all of these

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,170
sellers very they can come and publish

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,760
their inventory that can be sold in our

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,950
marketplace and and also the price

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,780
information right so these these get fed

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,910
into our system and we built up the

00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,760
listing based on your location you know

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,589
we kind of come up with the based on the

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,540
training in your area based on what's

00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,280
going on you you know

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,170
what others are buying what prices are

00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,170
buying so you get to know all of these

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,870
information and you know probably will

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,700
build you an experience that you know

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,750
e-commerce companies to offer so so

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,339
behind the scene it's a entirely

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,320
different from one of what what others

00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:24,610
do and I think what we do so you know I

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,410
just want to make sure that you know

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,970
product listing is it's actually one

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,560
aspect of the discovery

00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,270
you know listing is number one and then

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,950
after they after you list their

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,500
discovery takes place in your app right

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,870
so the app is basically is this the

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,570
entry point you know today we are only

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:43,720
upon me we launched in Android Market we

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,850
recently launched iOS and a few weeks

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,340
ago so so we're going to have Android

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,590
and iOS

00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,180
so you can download and install them and

00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,910
you know play around with it and you

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,870
know your solutions or you know your

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,630
purchase you're looking for your

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,220
purchases or from your local community

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,570
so you know discovery is something that

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,710
you know I think some of the challenges

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,880
that you're solving there is is going to

00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,530
be there's going to be a demo that you

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,810
know is going to be showing a little

00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:10,980
later the next product that the problem

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,910
that problem area that you're trying to

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,680
solve you know is the is the warranty

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,330
and services area likes opera shoe is a

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,650
new product that you're launching all

00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:24,120
right that's been launched up you know

00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:25,920
we going to come up with within more

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,630
extensive coverage for all the price you

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,430
buy and you know most of the things that

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,600
we run into in the past is that you know

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,520
that you want to claim or anything you

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,370
post of most of them won't have the

00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,020
receipts in order or you know won't even

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,520
know what model or make that you

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,230
purchased a bar you bought it from or

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,120
what price you borrow from all of this

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,890
information is kind of like it kind of

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,330
in a clutter or you need to sweep them

00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,770
through and once you get a hold off all

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,180
this information you need to call the

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,470
customer support them and I know how

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,120
much of a pain it is to go through that

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,070
and and we're gonna introduce one touch

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,510
claim service bar you know you would use

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,150
the HAP know what products you purchase

00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:00,030
you know either in our in our app or in

00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,070
our local community as well so are we

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,690
gonna be local store as well if you if

00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,790
you know if your purchase that we're

00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,640
gonna be able to do that one get served

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,810
you know servicing no documentation and

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,260
you're gonna give peace of mind up

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,460
slowly free right and coming to the

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,080
technology part these are the stacks

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,300
that some of some of the you know stacks

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,980
that we use to solve some other problems

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,810
and this keeps changing then then the

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,940
list keeps going actually I could just

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,800
put some of them here yeah so much more

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,960
actually you know there are some more

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,120
that you're working on and I think this

00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:34,020
these pretty much covers most part I

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,420
guess that's that's it from me and I

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,730
would like you know when I Ponte and so

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,100
that's to come over here and you know

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,330
before Wylie is coming and setting up

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,850
here probably I can ask a couple of

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,080
questions and and we can give her some

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,800
goodies if somebody answer something

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,790
yeah so I thought of taking questions

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,080
later on but I think if you have

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,570
questions that's fine I thought you know

00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:59,430
I could run some Chris program okay okay

00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:01,050
yeah that's a great question I think we

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,060
what we you know we you know

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,620
want to make sure I set the context I

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,660
think we are into consumer electronics

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,800
durables right now like not not all

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,480
moment pop stores but all

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,390
brick-and-mortar stores will sell this

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,720
goods so the the onboarding process is

00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:18,029
entirely you know entirely different

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,920
from what what typically does so they do

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,570
not come on board up themselves right

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,190
I think it's an offline process and

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,950
there is a lot of hand-holding because

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,350
we go through you know tons of checks

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,540
and balances before we on board a seller

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,130
because we want to main we want to make

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,260
sure that you know our service level is

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,970
met right you know I think we want to

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,920
guarantee that as opera service level

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,230
and also the the products that they buy

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,329
is is you know under person trusted

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,800
product not like any China maker or you

00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:46,019
know any other stuff kind of stuff right

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,339
so I think there's a lot of back on you

00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,470
know onboarding process that goes on

00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,990
before we launch to a new city there is

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,570
a lot of you know work that goes on so

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,769
we are lost in many cities so one of the

00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,680
questions that I want to ask is can you

00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:01,320
guys guess how many cities will be in by

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,760
the end of the year any rough guesses I

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,959
know I you know I've not mentioned that

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,959
here ten by another year not even close

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,520
are you getting there forty somebody

00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:17,810
said forty yeah so yeah that's that's

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,810
what we're targeting by another year

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:28,680
okay any other questions you wanna throw

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:31,680
in all right and we'll keep that for

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:35,870
people who ask questions in the end yeah

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:44,850
I'll leave the stage to rely upon day

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:45,600
not even take this from me here oh hi

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,760
everyone

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,120
uh I would like to request everyone

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,829
anyone who's using like hot spot here

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,260
because it's gonna be like it's

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:57,570
disrupting everything and because the

00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,720
pike in India this SSID should be

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,670
working okay and if you are using hot

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,760
spot it's going to like ruin everyone

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:10,260
here I'm sorry yesterday you didn't get

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,810
internet so yeah today hopefully like if

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,810
you have to use it and please USB

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:19,959
tethering or something

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:25,209
okay yeah I think it's good now so yeah

00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:29,040
so thanks vanish for interaction part so

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:31,779
yeah I'm Vinny panda I'm talking about

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,050
data science perspective or the

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:39,360
technological challenges that actually

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:42,850
we have to face okay so so basically

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,040
what you think is different or

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,079
challenging in hyper local market as

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,499
compared to online e-commerce portals

00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:58,680
like fit card can you miss any cases

00:15:50,499 --> 00:16:01,449
yeah okay all right so yeah so basically

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,920
we are hyper local markets so it's like

00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:08,649
we are distributed across cities right

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,249
we have lots of cities to cover and each

00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:14,589
city has its own set of problems like so

00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:17,410
when we talk about flip card so flip

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:19,180
card has its own warehouse so even if

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,879
you are ordering something from Delhi

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,949
and it's warehouse is in Bangalore they

00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,079
can actually provide you using that

00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:29,680
their logistic side we are not providing

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,269
logistics so the first challenge that we

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,019
have to face is like demand versus

00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:38,529
supply so we have to face we have to

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:40,600
check exactly in which area user is

00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,620
searching what and do we have that thing

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,240
in our inventory

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:49,809
right so second thing for this actually

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,660
we need a very strong catalog but the

00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:56,050
catalog population method that we use is

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,929
like we collects grouches from different

00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:02,529
vendors for their catalog we have our

00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:05,409
own app for vendors as well where they

00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:06,880
can provide information about their

00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:08,559
catalog or they can populate their

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,260
catalog there so that we can load it

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:15,419
into our centralized shopper catalog

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:17,589
okay but many times it happens that they

00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:22,179
didn't provide complete information

00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:23,789
sometimes the catalog is wrong sometimes

00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:24,939
they just provide partial information

00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:27,650
okay

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:30,860
so this is one of the big

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:34,490
challenge that we face for last miss in

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:37,310
last six months so how we solved it

00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:40,400
using Python stack and using machine

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:43,700
learning that I will show you a demo

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,860
and as someone here mentioned here that

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,700
we have to provide customized solution

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:52,190
for each user because each user is

00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,250
unique for us his requirement is very

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,550
unique and if we are not kettering that

00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,710
requirement in timely basis and in a

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:03,860
proper way then there may be a chance

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:06,770
then he can't just go to online market

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:12,100
to buy the product right so yes

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:15,590
to solve this so we use smart techniques

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,510
here the first thing that the first case

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,390
study I am talking about is automatic

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:22,610
catalog population okay so what was the

00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,220
objective so many times it happens that

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,410
we got brochures from vendors but it

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,510
didn't have complete information so let

00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,730
us say if you are talking about if a

00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,950
product is a mobile phone if a

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:37,070
particular seller is selling a mobile

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,230
phone then he just gave us the name of

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,690
that mobile phone or model numbers all

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:44,210
the other attributes that is there that

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,750
we have to fill it so there are two

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:51,620
options for this either we have to

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:53,660
populate this using websites right so we

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:57,200
have to go to different websites like

00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:00,050
flip kart snap deal check there the

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:04,130
attributes and then manually fit it into

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,960
our own system or we can automate the

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,750
system means basically we can actually

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,840
crawl the pages then we can pass it and

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,900
we can after passing we can process the

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,990
information and solve the process but

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:21,380
this overall pipeline has few challenges

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:24,380
first challenge is the data that we

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:27,020
crawled is not same it has it contains

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,380
lots of noise actually right so the

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,170
first issue that we have faced is how to

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,880
extract valid information from noise and

00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:41,210
the second problem that we faced here

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:43,309
was that basically the HTML structure

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,679
is continuously changing okay so for

00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:47,720
example when we crawl a particular web

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,580
page one months back its HTML

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,200
architecture is different its nodes are

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,270
different containing information but

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,909
when we crawl it today either that node

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,320
is not present there or there are some

00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:01,250
different nodes which contains the valid

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:05,059
information right so we actually use

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:08,960
scrap I to scrap all this information

00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:11,899
and then we have a main team which

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:17,149
manually checks the notes valid notes

00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:19,880
then they actually try to extract valid

00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:23,149
notes from HTML and then using expert we

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,960
used to extract fields but this is very

00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:30,020
tedious task so for example our

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:33,860
iterations used to take 15 days just to

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:36,860
crawl one just to complete one cycle we

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:39,740
need 15 days so if we want to scale and

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:43,809
if you actually want to provide good

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:48,679
service then we have to improve right so

00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:51,250
here we try to solve a problem that can

00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:54,559
we actually automate this process of

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:57,799
extracting information or finding valid

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,820
information from page okay so here we

00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:04,460
have to solve two problems first getting

00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,840
valid information getting the node which

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,299
actually contains valid information

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,370
first and then accepting that valid

00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:14,659
information you know format so that we

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:21,500
can populate our catalog okay so for

00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:24,049
example just we do small information so

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:27,500
let's say this is a page from Flipkart

00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:29,809
okay what we are interested is something

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,440
like this where we have attributes and

00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:36,080
we want their values right but if you

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,559
actually crawl that page and start

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,779
processing what you get is this it

00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,950
contains valid information but lot of

00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:47,320
noise right

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,320
lots of noise so how to solve this

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,210
okay so we do have lots of

00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:05,690
domain-specific knowledge with us like

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:08,649
we actually had a very comprehensive

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:11,960
list of grants competency list of

00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:14,480
categories colors and all okay so we

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,639
decided to use that information in our

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,710
favor so we first try to use a standard

00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:23,809
so basically we pose this problem as a

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:26,269
classification problem first where we

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,009
actually try to find out whether this

00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:30,350
particular node is a valid node or not

00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:32,210
we have to just classify it right so

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:37,340
there are lots of Stanek standard

00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:40,100
algorithms like SVM or linear regression

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:43,580
and all right so we can use that right

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:47,480
to get the data but because of noise and

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:52,850
because of outliers this the accuracy

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,500
was not that good so after lots of means

00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,480
basically after lots of iterations we

00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,879
decided to use weak learning algorithms

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,210
so basically the front of weak learning

00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:04,820
algorithm or in symbol is to learn small

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,679
and weak classifiers so basically big

00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,559
classifier is like they use just one

00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:12,049
rule to classify a particular node okay

00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:15,830
so we actually learn n number of

00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:17,990
classifiers then we combine them using a

00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:20,360
weighted average to get a final output

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:24,950
okay so we use our domain-specific

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:29,659
knowledge for that as well as the past

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:33,610
history okay so let me just do you one

00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:37,250
small demo so after getting information

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:40,759
we learn lots of small classifiers and

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:46,549
then we stored that classifier in terms

00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:49,940
of either model like CRF model or SOA

00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:54,169
model or in terms of regular expressions

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:56,389
okay so we have lots of small small weak

00:23:54,169 --> 00:24:02,629
learners that we learn and we use them

00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:06,320
to get so let's say we have a similar

00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:10,880
pitch and we need to classify that HTML

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,580
page into so basically we need to a

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,390
valid notes from that right so after

00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:20,150
running this process each and every note

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:23,360
is picked from the HTML page it is

00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,440
passed to all the classifiers and after

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,720
getting a result from all the

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,340
classifiers we simply combine the result

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,770
to check whether that particular note is

00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,590
valid or not so for example in this

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,310
particular HTML that I showed you a few

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:38,450
minutes back

00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:42,080
it contains 1250 notes in overall which

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:44,660
which are either recommended URLs links

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:49,280
some other information right but out of

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,870
that only 25 notes are valid or they

00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,230
contains the information which is

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:59,120
important to us right so after doing

00:24:54,230 --> 00:25:02,750
that we actually get class name a node

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,820
ID and it's tag so basically after

00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:08,330
getting this we can add automatic the

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:12,140
XPath process to scrap the data okay

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:15,740
and using that expert whatever we get we

00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:19,220
simply use it to push it to our

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,970
attribute extractor okay so attribute

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,680
extractor basically it also has lots of

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:28,400
classifiers plus we predominantly use

00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:31,340
CRF conditional random fields to

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,090
actually tag differently so this was the

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:38,180
title okay and these are the attributes

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,860
that we extract from here so after

00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,370
solving this problem using machine

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:47,120
learning the process that took 15 days

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:51,140
it gets reduced to almost 30 hours so

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,780
that means we can actually do crawling

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:57,950
almost after every three or four days

00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:01,160
actually yeah so yeah that is the smart

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,380
way how we you saw or how we solve

00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,120
problems

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,890
the other challenge or the other test

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,700
case that I want to talk about is like

00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:12,710
how can we provide a base deal to user

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:16,370
so before going to this do you have any

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:19,160
questions regarding the first demo yeah

00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:23,930
so as I said we used to do this manually

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,380
right so because of our crawling

00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,060
algorithm

00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:29,150
is very good so we have lots of wages

00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:35,030
thousands of wages per category sorry

00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:38,450
for portal and we have almost I think

00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:40,670
yeah almost 250 portals okay you know

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:45,020
systems so that is we have sufficient

00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:48,170
data okay so as I said we used to

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,720
manually gate nodes first right experts

00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,680
so from that actually extracting

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,140
information and processing that

00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,090
information all very easy so yes our

00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:00,940
first phase was manual effort but after

00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:04,250
that it's everything automated yeah so

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,470
okay so basically as I said for example

00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:11,080
if we are talking about a particular ad

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:13,730
so a particular node okay so the first

00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,290
classifier that we learn is like way

00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:19,820
that that particular node is contained

00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:22,970
any keyword like copyright call us email

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,860
us contact us right so it's very simple

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,680
rule based classifier which has some

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:30,230
does set of keywords so if it has that

00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,630
that means that note is not valid right

00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:35,270
the other feature that you can use is

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:38,510
like whether that particular node

00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:40,850
contains any specific attribute all

00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,250
right so if you write a classifier for

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:47,870
color base attribute so you feed all the

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:50,930
color names to it as a valid yeah sorry

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:53,060
as a positive example and everything

00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,520
else as a negative example right so

00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,260
based on that you will get it is also a

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,810
weak learner basically so based on that

00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,120
you will get one more weight inch right

00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,650
so after getting all the results all you

00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,740
have to do is like get the weighted

00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:08,690
average so each classifier has its own

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,980
set of features here it's not like a

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:17,050
common set of features used throughout

00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:20,600
yeah this might sound very primitive but

00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:24,400
for collecting the attributes instead of

00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,990
going to the next I mean the vendor

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,390
going to this source didn't work for you

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:32,630
or was there any limitation in that like

00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,820
these are the standard products that we

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:37,580
are talking about not non-standard ones

00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:40,640
so why don't we I mean was it what what

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:43,820
was the difficulty in going to this

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,900
source or the manufacturer to get these

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:51,620
attributes yeah so basically we have

00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,870
type with lots of brands so from that

00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:58,400
whatever data we get is really good

00:28:53,870 --> 00:29:00,380
but if we are here the problem that I am

00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,390
talking about is regarding a particular

00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,550
vendor who is providing us just a

00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:07,730
browser right so many times browsers

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:10,370
doesn't contains all the information all

00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,960
complete information ok so there are

00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,330
attributes which are not present there

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,450
but as per users they are important

00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,980
right so to populate that attributes we

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,990
are using this internal my question is

00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,850
so the different products have different

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:25,100
variants like according to different

00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:27,260
colors the price may vary so how do you

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,940
are tackling these kind of problems so

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,860
like there are different swatches like

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,200
drop-down swatches containing the size

00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,180
color swatch and all different types so

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,230
are you'd like taking care of these or

00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:42,170
just like the first price of the yeah on

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:44,480
the page so basically we actually

00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:47,030
divided our categories into two broader

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,730
part when is hard categories and when

00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:52,420
it's soft carries so in hard categories

00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:55,100
per se there the categories which has

00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:57,320
lots of things in common and they don't

00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:02,210
change that frequently for example

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:05,060
Mobile's right or let's say tablets

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,530
right so if you compare mobiles and

00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,420
tablets there are lots of attributes

00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,160
common to them all right they have a

00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:13,070
primary camera they have RAM they have

00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,370
memory so we Club categories into a

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,180
different subgroups and we learn

00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,280
classifiers for that particular

00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,410
subgroups only so whenever we get a

00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,010
particular title we first categorizing

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:27,380
it into a specific category and then we

00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:31,180
use classifiers for that particular

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:33,410
class agree on that title only so yeah

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,510
after getting the list of twenty five

00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,310
nodes how are you able to ignore the Dom

00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:39,770
structure and like getting the exact

00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:41,570
category your exact tries out of it

00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,610
because the Dom node may vary right

00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,280
randomly on each of the product websites

00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:48,560
so you mean to say that information that

00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,810
the attributes that we extract yes how

00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,500
do you get when to and mapping it saying

00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,180
category

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,040
got sleeve with a confirmation so what

00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:58,280
is the confidence level related to it or

00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:01,790
what is the logic behind getting okay so

00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:05,210
basically after studying lots of

00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:07,910
Porter's we find out that some photos

00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,490
some standard totals like Flipkart or

00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:15,860
snapping they have their own unique way

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:19,970
to write information okay so if you so

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:22,640
for example it's so if you see flip card

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,410
it follows this convention for all the

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,500
products irrespective of its category

00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:32,060
okay so from this if you actually learn

00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:34,190
a pattern that if you get two attributes

00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,720
or two keywords there there may be a

00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:37,910
chance that this particular keywords is

00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,670
attribute and this particular keyword is

00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:45,980
a value right so here we use pattern

00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:49,070
learning okay plus actually we have we

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,950
build CRF models where we feed

00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:55,820
information to it in case of if we have

00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:58,400
a description like this okay so for

00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:01,190
example here if you want to check if

00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,560
this particular thing is hand wash or

00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,570
machine wash right so for this type of

00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,520
things we simply build a CRF model where

00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:09,350
we manually tag the data and learn the

00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,960
serial so whenever it gets something

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:14,540
like this it's simply labeled that

00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,380
particular thing as machine wash or hand

00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:20,270
wash right using some label then a based

00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,630
on weighted average of both rule base

00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:27,710
plus CRF model we can get the final

00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:30,080
value yeah so as I said our system

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,750
actually tries to learn this patterns or

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,510
this information in each iteration so

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:38,510
whenever we finish our first iteration

00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:40,310
we manually check the data okay after

00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,590
manually checking the data we freed up

00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:46,900
you know catalog and that information is

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:49,850
one again used to run or relearn or

00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,980
models so basically if it happens that

00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,610
for a particular portal the pattern got

00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,030
changed

00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:57,680
that simply means all the information

00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:01,100
coming from that portals is not valid

00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,830
all right so basically instead of say

00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,240
sleeves short sleeves there may be a

00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,789
chance that sleeves shortly

00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,860
and public health public information

00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:12,169
here right so in that case maybe will be

00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,929
based on this rule based systems will

00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:22,510
get sleeves equals to fabric right which

00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:25,100
is wrong yes it can be a possibility but

00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:29,390
in that case actually we have to think

00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:32,539
differently right but currently for

00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:34,429
these sides these models works and if we

00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:37,850
get wrong it at that time I think

00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:39,860
learning patterns from that or getting

00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:43,270
information using some other

00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,270
technologies will definitely help you

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:49,720
know see we are getting data from

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,450
Flipkart yes but we are not selling it

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,279
we are simply utilizing the knowledge

00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,390
contains in that particular webpage

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,809
right

00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:03,289
we are not see basically we are selling

00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:05,059
products but from vendors the

00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:08,750
information that if we are crawling from

00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:11,300
Flipkart is simply attributes or

00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:17,240
knowledge about that product right and

00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:19,399
even if sleep yeah so adding to that

00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,810
actually we have we are actually

00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,879
planning to type it lots of

00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,940
manufacturers lots of grants directly

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,240
right in that case even if flip-flop

00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:31,790
sorry Flipkart blocks us we simply get

00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,760
data from any other sources right so

00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,679
this is like automation of the manual

00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:40,040
effort that we are taking so that we can

00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:44,119
get information as much fast as possible

00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:46,460
right okay that's the aspect here so how

00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,099
do you manage you inventory's like like

00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:51,919
reservation I mean just suppose a vendor

00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:53,540
has five mobile phones in stock and I

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,330
want to buy three online through your

00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,490
app and suppose my friend also visit

00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,040
this retail store and once three so how

00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:03,890
do you manage that that question

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:08,570
actually I I think Siddhartha the Kadesh

00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:10,730
can answer that questions so yeah

00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,589
basically we are short on time can I

00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,089
just cover my second ever first and then

00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:17,799
we can talk issues thank you very much

00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:20,599
yeah okay the next

00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:24,440
case study that we are trying to solve

00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,869
here is like how to provide base ding to

00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:33,849
user okay

00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:35,990
so objective was to basically recommend

00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:38,240
so basically if user is searching

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,460
something okay there may be a chance

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,410
that he has a vague idea about that

00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:47,809
particular product in his mind all right

00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:50,750
so can we actually recommend a good

00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:54,950
product or a base product which contains

00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:57,799
that particular attributes plus some

00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:59,059
other good feature about that right so

00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:01,849
for example if you are searching a

00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:05,539
mobile phone which has let's say 13

00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:08,539
megapixel camera and 2gb RAM right but

00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:11,180
8gb memory so it will be storage so can

00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:13,460
we actually recommend other product

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:17,390
which has all these features plus some

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:19,789
good features as well right so we try to

00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:22,819
solve that problems using recommendation

00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:24,619
systems so we basically combined

00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:27,710
attribute based recommendation system

00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:29,089
plus collaborative filtering okay but as

00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:32,119
we are hyperlocal

00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:34,700
we have to think about a very important

00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,160
third feature here and that is location

00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,930
so there may be a chance that whatever

00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,089
user is searching and whichever the

00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,740
product is very much similar to that

00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:45,170
particular product is not present in

00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:48,529
that location so how to solve that thing

00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:50,869
then what to recommend to user right so

00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:54,769
here our recommendation system is not

00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:59,109
only based on users criteria it should

00:36:54,769 --> 00:37:03,920
be based on location as well ok so here

00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:10,730
we build a model where we try to find

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:13,130
out score for each product in our app we

00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:15,980
call it as upper score so basically the

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:18,319
super scope is calculated based on the

00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:20,359
product features so if a particular

00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,700
product has all the latest features or

00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:26,839
all the good features it has more so per

00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:29,000
score okay and whenever a particular

00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:31,579
user is searching something so based we

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,279
actually study the users

00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:37,880
behavior throughout our app we try to

00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:43,390
personalize it and then based on user's

00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:46,309
location we try to give a base product

00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:48,619
based on soccer score to em okay so

00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:51,170
basically if a particular user is

00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:53,509
searching something in this case a

00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,430
washing machine okay so these are the

00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:57,769
recommend recommended products for a

00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:01,579
user in Bangalore as compared to user in

00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:05,329
Delhi so basically this particular

00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:09,019
washing machine is 5.5 kg with same

00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:10,579
brand okay but for that particular price

00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:13,309
range that particular reason can

00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:15,259
actually get a 6 kg washing machine okay

00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:19,910
with the same brand and some good

00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:22,339
features okay so here along with 5.5 kg

00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:24,440
we are actually recommending him 6 kg

00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:25,910
washing machines as well and that

00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,339
recommendations is actually getting

00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:34,789
changed based on its location okay so

00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:36,529
yeah here to actually achieve that we

00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:37,999
have to think about two problems first

00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:41,299
is personalization and second is data

00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:43,819
warehousing so in personalization based

00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:46,249
on user sessions and users pass history

00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:48,650
we try to build a user persona where we

00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:50,779
try to find out what are the categories

00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:52,430
of products users are searching

00:38:50,779 --> 00:38:54,410
what are his base categories and

00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:57,349
products and how we based on that

00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:59,539
information and by adding it with

00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:01,459
information of some other users how can

00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:04,910
we collaborate the information and give

00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:06,739
him base results okay so for this we are

00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,569
currently building our own data

00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:10,160
warehousing system where we try to

00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:13,369
collect data from all the sources

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,420
process it and analyze it so yeah that's

00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:20,809
the next thing that is in pipeline so

00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:25,819
any question regarding this demo no it's

00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:28,190
not it's basically so basically we

00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:31,819
actually find out few features for each

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,799
category or each product okay and we

00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:36,170
assign weight to each feature so

00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:38,059
basically it's a linear regression type

00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:41,180
of things where for each features we

00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:43,660
calculate the weight we dynamically

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,300
change the weighting based on the new

00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,940
products in

00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,890
Margot and from that actually we are

00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,570
calculating a Java score so let's say if

00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,600
there is a latest product in the market

00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:56,670
it has higher soccer score as compared

00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,510
to the old product but as time passed

00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:02,100
its Zopa score keeps on decreasing

00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:04,290
hypermarket nodes for calculating soccer

00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,270
score actually we didn't use hypermarket

00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:09,240
for calculating Sauber score we are

00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:12,390
simply using product features okay the

00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,430
features that we actually find out for a

00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,500
particular category after getting that

00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:19,020
while recommending a product we are

00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:22,500
using location so it's two different

00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:25,530
problem actually yeah hi how are you

00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,310
measuring the effectiveness of the

00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:32,220
scores that you are calculating

00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:33,900
effectiveness okay so first thing the as

00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:37,290
I said the scores that we have

00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:41,550
calculated they are based on the latest

00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:43,770
technologies or latest features in that

00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:45,090
particular category right so if a

00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:48,240
particular phone is containing

00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:50,250
everything ladies so for example let's

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,330
say in case of one plus one it has a

00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:57,210
lowest price right it has all the good

00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:59,970
features that we can call as flagship

00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:02,250
killer features right so after

00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:04,650
calculating all these features we

00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:07,650
actually assigning it a number right and

00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:10,680
all the Java score for all the products

00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:14,280
in that category are relative to the

00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:18,000
topmost right so based on that we are

00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:20,520
actually calculate the ranking while

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,290
showing that particular product to the

00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,120
user so let's say if you are searching a

00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:26,240
mobile so whatever mobile you are

00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:30,180
getting they are based on a Java score

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,550
okay so then we actually check whether a

00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,870
user actually clicking on first or

00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,480
second link or not

00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:38,970
right so based on users click lock we

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,530
get to know that even though we are

00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,990
giving more source code with this

00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:45,360
particular category or sorry this

00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:47,700
particular product user is not clicking

00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,290
on that right so that is a feedback loop

00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:57,350
so based on that feedback loop we

00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:57,350
