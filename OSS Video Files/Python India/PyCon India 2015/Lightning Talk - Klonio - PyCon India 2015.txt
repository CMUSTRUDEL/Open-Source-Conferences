viewer and and third thing is just two

00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:08,710
hours ago our cloud-based we use

00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,140
and one of our production deployments

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,670
and they just without informing us

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,479
upgrade to three-point-something

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:22,060
and our site is now down I saw you re

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:32,710
API is done so i am left with a couple

00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:36,250
of screenshots and VLC media player and

00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:38,950
yeah i hope i can make you guys

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,590
understand anyway so yeah let's start so

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,360
the first thing ok waters clone you in

00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,610
one line colonia is a database version

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,709
control tool so how many of you use a

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,160
source code version control tool like

00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:54,729
get or as mercurial everybody uses it

00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,789
it's it's like a necessity these days ok

00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:59,860
so but if i ask you the question what do

00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:02,440
you do with your database what about

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,619
your database do you were djin it how do

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,239
you how do you say you see you and your

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:09,250
co-founder working on something and you

00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,989
want to add a new table or new

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,510
collection how do you collaborate these

00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,580
changes what do you do how do you do you

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,080
urge in your schema what and then

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,450
finally when you put it up on the cloud

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,970
how do you handle your backups do is

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,430
there a workflow that you follow or is

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,080
it a big mess like what I have

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,170
experienced in all my years of working

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,830
in computer science and also meeting at

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,980
the other startups so we created colonia

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,480
to solve this problem so yeah as i said

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,790
i have a couple of screenshots this is

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:45,030
at 0.3 g why we are in 0.5 correctly so

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:53,450
oh we else you are ok

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:56,130
oh hi so I reality and click and cook so

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,709
this is the dashboard so basically is

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,510
the GUI then CLI as well it supports

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,120
 Maya and postgres at the moment

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,640
week we're adding more databases as you

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:17,190
can about every day and yeah so oh

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:20,120
it plays automatically oh okay so yeah

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,290
so this is a very simple dashboard and

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,910
yeah instead of talking but I want to

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,230
talk to you guys probably in an

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,180
interactive way what do you guys do for

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,370
your databases if anybody could tell me

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,220
like if you have like an amazing way to

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,750
handle your things without Colonia oh

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:38,420
yeah what do you do anybody from a

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,730
starter or any founder yeah fly okay and

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,250
any somebody said ORM right who is that

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,739
yeah so what do you do you're over m so

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,140
you version your you your RM is

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,820
basically code right so you version it

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:57,209
to get is it okay migrations yeah that's

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,940
the currently the biggest thing yeah so

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,989
just a big show of hands how many of you

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,160
would want such a tool in the

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:08,280
marketplace we have it works yeah I will

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,530
be showing you that so yeah very good

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,190
question the very very good statement

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,600
the thing is when actually this is one

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,459
of the few i started this wonder if you

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,140
are ago and when i started i was all

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,030
like you're pumped up and all i'm going

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,800
to do some crazy stick and then when i

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:26,880
started i realized why nobody i created

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,880
this till now it's insanely complex and

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,160
hard and when you talk of something like

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,810
it if you if it works for source code

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,970
basically it's a text file it works for

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,010
any language right end of the day as a

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,240
text file but when you build its build

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,550
when you build something for databases

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,900
each database the source code is

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,580
different I mean the way it is is

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,140
different each version of the database

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,270
can have changes that can break an

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,760
application like this so it has been a

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:54,360
really complex task to build these

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:57,390
things and yeah so as you said does it

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,950
work so let me show you so this is how

00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:04,920
you add a database

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:07,200
and yeah yes yes so this is this main

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,510
screen so as you can see this is for

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,850
 by the way it's showing you that

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,860
there are two collections added here

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:18,600
along with the keys in each collection

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,910
and then a simple commit like this once

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,620
it's committed the UI shows you that

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,690
there are no database changes anymore

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,400
and then when you go back and make a

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,620
change and come back to this you will

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,270
see that anything else that you added

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,920
has shown up here so basically these are

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,600
called comments just like it and we

00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,550
modeled it to you know reflect exactly

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,780
like it so that if you know how to use

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,370
get you can email e start using

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,860
something like this explain again yeah

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,530
so this is what Chloe this is what

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:53,160
Colonials and if you have any questions

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,960
