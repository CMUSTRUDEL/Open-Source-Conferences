There are lots of good tools out there which facilitate security testing of web applications for different class of vulnerabilities. As a penetration tester or a developer, running these tools along with some custom tests is always a requirement. Calling those tools by remembering their command line arguments or organising the collected data is a difficult task. Repeating this task multiple times manually might make you go crazy. As this is Pycon, python comes for the rescue.
