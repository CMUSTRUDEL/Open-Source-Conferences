okay I'm again calling out the names

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:14,040
harsh gupta is he here harsh gupta amit

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:15,780
kumar yes okay yeah she's here but here

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,410
to take some time I would I would be

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:24,119
okay so the next talk is SQL al-jami by

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:29,490
yash mehrotra putting his talk so s so

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,740
monrovia so men represent oh yes yeah so

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,219
a pretty interesting topic I mean for

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,570
this session Indian male are still not

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:42,930
repre still acting tough topic so okay I

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,680
again repeat Indian men are still not a

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,329
rapist I am so mins oh and uh I woke is

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,410
a senior data scientist in August at

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,559
home so what I only wanted to do was I

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,020
wanted to take bouquet and the pies

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,690
ggplot for a test drive so I've been

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,489
wanting to experiment with grammar of

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,769
graphics in Python for a long time and

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,560
though i had written earlier this year

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,680
of post called Indian men are not rapist

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,500
if you would remember there was a the

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,270
whole live episode that happened so I

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,600
wanted to reproduce those graphs using a

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,880
bouquet and the Jesus plot both of which

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,220
implement gamma of traffics in Python

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,890
and I wanted to see what the effects are

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,840
like so that was quite disappointing

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,759
bouquet I think taste to look more like

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,299
excel but I did get caught up in the

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,409
story and that's what I'm going to look

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,320
at first so this is the so these are the

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:47,340
top 10 countries if you look at the rate

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,780
of rate the rate of rape in 2010 so that

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,479
is the number of rapes per one lakh

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,270
population and if you look at the top so

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,530
this one here that is just India and if

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,170
you look at the top 20 those are

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,060
Australia US UK and it's not just

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,000
limited to first world countries there

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,340
are both fauna and the Chicago and other

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,520
countries like that too right so we are

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,259
nowhere near the top Indian manner but

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,259
not particularly known for

00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:20,550
right so so I think our small vote of

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,710
confidence in favor of Indian men so the

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,020
typical rebuttal to that in fact most

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,090
cases are not reported but that is not a

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,060
thing that is unique to India if you

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,820
look at even the US UK there is a reaper

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,740
so their official statistics they admit

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,870
that maybe ten to twenty twenty percent

00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,630
of their cases are reported and most

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,000
cases actually do go unreported so here

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:46,470
the onus of proof does not really lie on

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,690
Indian men because you know you cannot

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,760
say that most of those things simply do

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,520
not get reported in India particularly

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,990
because if you look at that top 10 list

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,870
there are other third world countries

00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,440
there as well right so it without

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:07,320
further investigation you can't really

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:09,180
hold that accusation it India right and

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,190
also there is a definition of a point if

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,130
you go by the way we defined rape is

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:18,420
actually quite conservative so it is all

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:20,640
inclusive and if you anyway look at it

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,130
so the data was available for about

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,040
sixty two nations or only five have a

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,739
smaller rate of rape 14 f equal or

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,410
smaller and the mean is like 40 40 point

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,940
29 and India is just one out of every

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,760
one like population and the median is

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,739
kind of six so you know we are not

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,620
particularly bad in we have pretty much

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,239
in the bottom and for once it feels good

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,680
to go in the body it's between the

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,330
bottom right so then I want so another

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,160
thing I wanted to look at how is this

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,000
data these statistics are actually being

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,790
portrayed in the media and so we know

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,260
that Indian media is quite a ghost

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,209
pressure for sentient sensational stats

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,760
so this particular one is so I just took

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:10,200
one website which has repetitive stats

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,930
and I just went to them carefully so in

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,209
this URL so these are the two key stats

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,709
that they talk about so for every 25

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,549
minutes one rape occurs somewhere in

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,130
India and so crimes against women they

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,990
increase from two by six seventy percent

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,599
between 2001 to 2000

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,550
12 so both of these are quite shocking

00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:32,039
statistics at first glance but if you

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,259
really think about it they do not really

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,539
factor in the population growth I mean

00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,220
that 21 minutes is going to go down to

00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:40,530
15 minutes at some point of time right

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,419
but is that really a cause for worry you

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:48,000
need to explore the story there right

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:49,380
but so that is not that so but you could

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,349
argue that you know why take away

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,060
limelight from a issue which is

00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:56,400
obviously very serious problem in our

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,560
society right the thing is if you put

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,139
too much of focus in one issue you tend

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,870
to take away the focus from other more

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,400
relevant and more pressing issues so

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,470
which is what happened I mean so I

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,849
followed followed of the sources the

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,639
source from which they were quoting the

00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:14,130
statistics and and this is what happened

00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,349
so so I am looking at two different

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,270
crimes against women so one is rape and

00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:21,060
kidnapping and abduction of women and

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,990
girls if you can look at the growth over

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,750
time between 2000 or 12 2013 I added one

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,479
more year here so here in the rape so

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,380
you can see that the growth is linear

00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:36,240
this almost seems exponential right

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,389
kidnapping had an abduction of women of

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,960
girls seen in in fact in 2001 so the

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:45,229
counter for Rafe was about 14 18

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,389
thousand cases or per lakh and

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:50,759
kidnapping was about 18,000 by the end

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,590
of it as you can see at some point of

00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,560
time kidnapping and abduction of women

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,599
surpass the rate of rape and it's both

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,030
is a much more significant problem today

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,830
then rape actually is and nobody is

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,880
talking about this nobody is looking why

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:08,190
this happened right and the rights of

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,690
the stop a linear growth versus

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:14,069
exponential growth and we should be

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:16,740
focused really right so that fifty five

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,840
percent came from rave fixed and you can

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,069
look at the stats speak for themselves

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,659
and so just one last thing so another

00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,520
example is so that was something that

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:28,560
increased and here the conviction rate

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,389
of rapes that fell but this is very

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,089
typical of the kind of graphs and charts

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:37,289
we see in the media so if you can really

00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:38,139
see the y-axis is manipulated so that

00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:40,360
you can

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,909
see such a sharp fall in the conviction

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,430
rate this chart if you really look at it

00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:47,050
this is what it actually looks like if

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,430
you plot it with the full access right

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:53,770
so there is no I mean if you want to how

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,419
does it really very right i mean there

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,490
is no story around that there is no

00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:01,479
comparison with other countries there is

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:05,740
no we simply know how don't know how how

00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,419
much it fluctuates right but okay if you

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,639
put it like this it looks like a very

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:12,639
sensational story but they chose to

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:16,349
either unless you dig up on right so

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,349
