	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,569
so today I'm going to talk about

00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:11,309
contributors colleagues customers and

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,840
clients so to keep it up front so this

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,549
is not going to be a marketing talk for

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,369
a tad though it's a it's a sponsor to

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,020
talk but we'll look into some of the

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,420
aspects that we have learnt over a

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:27,000
period of time working on the open sores

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:29,750
and some of the things that people who

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,980
are in the business are doing right so

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,260
we will look into some of the lessons

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,480
learned and some of the some takeaways

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,260
probably right so and we'll also look at

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,489
well what could be the possibly next for

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,010
open source so it all started 30 years

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:51,030
back and I think it's appropriate to say

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,370
30 years because in 1985 the free

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,670
software foundation was started and i

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,219
think it was Esther de prisa the FSF had

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,940
the 30 year celebrations if you are

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,309
following you'll probably know so 30

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,310
years back Richard Stallman he wanted to

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,770
work on a piece of software that would

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,770
improve the performance of computer that

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,900
he is using right so when he wanted

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:21,330
wanted to get access to that code he was

00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,970
he couldn't access that so he tried

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,360
contacting the people who gave the

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,000
software but they they told him that

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,049
they can give the access but he has to

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,990
do a lot of paperwork and and stuff and

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,710
also importantly they also said that he

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,320
wouldn't be allowed to share so that's

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,740
something that really got Richard

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,829
Stallman thinking and you know from from

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,780
there they started to work on something

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:58,200
like UNIX imitation so the glue was

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,479
started and you know the bunch of people

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,159
they start to they start to take this

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:09,060
path of liberating software so you know

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,310
they it's because back then if you

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,319
wanted to use a computer you had no

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,040
other means of using it other than

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,420
having a proprietary software so many

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,480
did not like it but there was no

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,180
alternative so so they were they were on

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,120
their part to liberate software right so

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:31,530
so they continued on the path and you

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,329
know after after a certain time when the

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,709
word got out when they when people got

00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:36,599
to know that there is something like

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,810
knew that was going to that is happening

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:42,060
in the industry when they look back

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,879
right so now they had like a lot of

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,810
people who were ready to contribute to

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:52,139
the free software so this was this was

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,699
like change a shift in the way the

00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,739
traditional software used to work and

00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,439
the software being controlled but

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,169
suddenly they were like people who now

00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:05,819
had some tools to work on on a free

00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:11,099
software so so it was amazing it was

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:14,069
amazing feeling right so and after a few

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:18,000
years after after the Free Software

00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,639
Foundation right like few there was

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,099
there are some smart people extremely

00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:28,199
smart people who thought that free

00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:29,699
software is really really great and they

00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,739
thought that there is definitely some

00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,099
business opportunity in the free

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,139
software so when they when these

00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,239
extremely smart people they took this

00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,139
free software and then went to people

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,419
saying that here you know what we have a

00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:48,599
unix-like system which is less expensive

00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:52,849
and runs faster but the industry really

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:55,979
did not accept it that well they said oh

00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:59,129
what does free mean here right so even

00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:01,739
though rms famously said it's free as in

00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:05,989
freedom and not feeling free beer but in

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:10,439
there it was difficult to explain people

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:12,269
so these these business folks right so

00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,939
the folks who wanted to make business or

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:18,840
of out of free software they are the

00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:20,699
ones who coined the term open source now

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,979
this was different it was easier to

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,630
explain and you saw it also open source

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,630
also touched upon some of the

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:33,060
practicality of developing a software in

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,889
a more collaborative and sharing manner

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,349
and what was open and that was freely

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:40,449
shareable right so so they they touched

00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,370
upon this so they coined this term open

00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:49,419
source and then the industry started

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:52,300
accepting so so what exactly was open

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:55,660
source right so open source is a way of

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,699
collaborating with other people having a

00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,220
free distributed software without having

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:03,070
to worry about the intellectual property

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,610
and have without having to go through a

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:10,210
lot of legal papers or anything of that

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:16,030
sort so this this this was a great shift

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:17,860
and and people we started now seeing a

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,780
lot of contributions coming from a lot

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,440
of people so there were contributions

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,849
from individuals the contributions from

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,169
organizations and there was

00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:32,229
contributions from people who were in

00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,570
the academics right so that there was a

00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,310
huge amount of contributions coming up

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,159
now they're like an army of people who

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:44,020
had this GPL and everything with them a

00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:46,150
cube to take on the world so what what

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,039
exactly was going on in the in the open

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,000
source right so what was going on inside

00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:54,940
the open source it's interesting right

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,180
so there were there were some rules that

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,949
were given which said that free

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,139
distribution of software and the source

00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:07,690
code should be made available with the

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:10,060
software right and the if anybody wants

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:13,599
to improvise this code you know he

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,180
should have the ability to work on the

00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:18,639
software feeling and distributed freely

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,620
but keeping the original author intact

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,680
right so there was some golden rules

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:29,560
that were laid out so what what exactly

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:31,530
went on in in open source was completely

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,610
opposite to what a traditional software

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,089
development system would look like you

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,920
know in traditional way you learn that

00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:40,620
you need to manage complexity

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,570
you need to have a small group of people

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,360
right and then and then you need to you

00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:49,900
need to have a plan and stuff like that

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,430
right so the open source in the open

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,110
source it was completely opposite there

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:57,750
were like hundreds of people across

00:06:53,110 --> 00:07:00,610
globe debating defending their ideas and

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,130
you know being very critical about the

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,870
peer review code so it was completely I

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,740
mean if somebody looks from an outside

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:11,320
world and it looked completely chaotic

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,880
but then you know what what was

00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,800
happening was you know they were there

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,570
were like people who are organically

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,750
coming together to solve a common

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,940
problem right and when people do that in

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,340
a community to come together and

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,400
organically solve a problem there is

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,750
this incredible amount of

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,320
cross-pollination of ideas that happen

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,600
between people and they start producing

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,110
at a pace that was unprecedented and it

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,020
just took off right so they're like lot

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,330
of people contributing and industry had

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:47,350
never seen the pace at which the

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:49,030
innovation was happening so um so it was

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,710
no longer you know the person who was

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,930
sitting next to you was your colleague

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,180
but you know the person who was say

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,340
working on working somewhere else and

00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:01,540
remotely was your colleague and they

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:04,360
helped each other to to solve this

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:09,640
common problem so it was a completely

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:14,740
different perspective so what's what's

00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:17,050
next for open source right so I think

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,300
you know it is not something new this

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,730
this happened earlier and I'll I'll tell

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:26,740
you you know I will take you back to the

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:29,920
initial the next days so i think we are

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,960
at a stage now where we can look at the

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,640
cross-pollination between the community

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,600
serv and the people within the community

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:42,520
and with the people right so so let me

00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:46,810
tell you about the linux and apache so

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,850
when linux came when linux came it was

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,520
definitely less expensive faster and

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,170
everything but the adoption rate was not

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,690
as

00:08:52,170 --> 00:09:00,060
much as you'd expect it to be in

00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:03,769
industry right so until until Apache

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:07,290
happened so what Apache did was Apache

00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:10,320
suddenly gave a business case to to

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:13,019
linux so Apache work best on limits and

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,839
it was faster and and I asked is loaded

00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:20,630
because Apache could do something like

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,630
it allowed you to host multiple websites

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:25,800
on a single machine that the then

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:29,190
proprietary web servers did not allow

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:34,320
them to do right so so this was this was

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:37,199
completely something new so why so if

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,720
you look into it why why did Apache work

00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:41,100
best on linux right so it was the

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,740
community members who are contributing

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,070
to linux where where the community

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,589
members who were contributing to Apache

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,420
all right so so they were they were you

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:56,880
know exchanging ideas and there was this

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:58,620
there's this incredible ideas that were

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,510
exchanged and and that solutions that

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,709
the real-time solutions were solved

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:07,800
right on the fly and it open so look at

00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:10,110
look at your colleagues as you know in a

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,930
much broader perspective I think that's

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,230
one of the major shift that we would

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,570
want to see in industry is working

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:22,070
between communities so when when when

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:26,190
you guys think of opening our say

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:29,519
working on a new project right so the

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:33,320
framework allows you to just start a new

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,540
new project and and work on it but I

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:40,110
think it's always good to look into what

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,990
the other projects are there and try to

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,910
contribute probably you know work

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,120
together than then working as

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,790
individuals so so that's that's one of

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,290
the message I think that is important

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:58,290
that we we learn as we move forward so

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:01,040
let me ask you this how many of your

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:05,209
entrepreneurs here any entrepreneurs

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:12,250
okay and anybody who is aspiring to be

00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:16,850
entrepreneurs okay good so so when when

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:18,740
you know it's it's it's a platform for

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:22,069
entrepreneurs to work on right because

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,500
open source world is is a place where

00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:28,639
you can freely exchange ideas and and

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,350
thoughts and everything it is when you

00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,300
start a project or when you start

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:35,779
something you know it's the originality

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,079
that that counts right so people who

00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,610
have started organizations or say

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,490
startups you would think that okay I

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:46,130
have some original idea and let me start

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:54,670
something but is that enough is that

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:58,970
enough that's the question so you know

00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:02,709
interestingly ol tired who is a French

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:05,480
enlightenment writer he has said that

00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:09,410
originality is nothing but judicious

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,079
invitation right so the word judicious

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,420
is important here now if you if you look

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,810
at how linux and new came came to this

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,399
world there was nothing but an imitation

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:26,120
of what unix was doing at that time

00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:30,230
right but so so it's really not what it

00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,380
it's not the not making it the way to

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,660
work in a new manner but it is important

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:40,130
that you know you have to make it work

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:43,190
with a new vision so so that's that's

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:45,860
the key so so think think think about

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,899
originality as something that when you

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,029
start something no look at it with a new

00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:53,480
vision that it solves some problems but

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:56,180
that's not entirely enough right so what

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,689
is important is you know your idea

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:04,670
should be enterprise when I say

00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:09,170
enterprise you know it should it should

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:12,319
have the capability to take complex

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,500
things and you know solve complex

00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,050
problems

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,690
and also earn money for you guys right

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,850
so the only money is an important thing

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,540
because you know that kind of leads into

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,650
what what we're going to talk next

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:29,100
because that gives a customer

00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:32,520
perspective or client perspective for

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,710
your product so so think think of what

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,440
Enterprise it has a lot of lot of you

00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,910
know the business and everything but but

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,100
it if you look at it there is a

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:44,220
community and there is also environment

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,020
right so so when we when we look at

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,070
enterprise you know the choice that you

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:55,080
make or set up your project for is

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:57,090
important so when you start a project

00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,400
don't think of starting a project with

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,590
just originality in mind but start a

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:05,460
project which can be an enterprise-ready

00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:07,500
project right so well when I say

00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,720
enterprise-ready you have to make right

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,360
choices now you you guys select Python

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,770
right because python is something that

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,420
we know that there are enterprise

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:21,839
products that already news or you rather

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:26,280
using Python right so similarly fedora

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:29,820
right so Fedora is future for l and r l

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,670
we have you know numerous examples that

00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,680
rel has Enterprise Products running on

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:42,750
it right so the choice is really

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:46,710
important here so client side so when

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:50,010
you set up this the clients there is a

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:52,710
very blurry definition of what if with a

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:55,589
client and with a customer but a client

00:14:52,710 --> 00:15:00,110
you can you can think of someone with

00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:00,110
whom there is a regular engagement and

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:07,140
and for a short duration of time write a

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:11,760
customer is someone with whom you would

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:13,520
you would have engagements or says

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,990
whenever the real issue comes up or

00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,480
there is a value then you talk to the

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,870
customer than engaging them on a

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,339
continuous basis right so so clients are

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,910
important lines are really important

00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,490
because they really work with you

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,800
to develop that particular project of

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,750
yours and make it enterprise-ready it is

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,960
important that you know you look any

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:38,000
startups who want to make a product if

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,680
you want to say that oh we have

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,050
customers you know in the initial days

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,900
it's always clients for you guys because

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,540
you know you need to engage with them a

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:50,450
little bit more and then and then and

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,410
then you know let them help you to

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:56,660
develop a product that is

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:59,150
enterprise-ready right so that's that's

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,100
what right does you know I don't want to

00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:06,280
take more time here but that's what rare

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:09,890
does so reddit initiates the projects

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:12,020
which are which are enterprise-ready so

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,720
when you see a red hat initiated project

00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,460
in any of the open source world like

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,370
fedora or or there are numerous of

00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,890
others they make it enterprise-ready

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,580
projects but but it's not a product

00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:28,720
right so an enterprise-ready project is

00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:32,480
different from an enterprise product so

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,330
the choices that we make a track for a

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,920
project is is really crucial for us so

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,490
there's like a lot of brainstorming that

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,370
happens in the community and I think I

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:46,510
think which is really important and we

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,190
make the right choices and once once the

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,890
ones that project is matured enough in

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,530
community right then we we take it back

00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:56,960
to the Red Hat and then you know we do a

00:16:54,530 --> 00:17:00,800
lot of hardening of what we call it as

00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,600
hardening of the product right and then

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,410
we release it as an enterprise product

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,320
so I think that for any of you guys who

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,750
want to start a new project think think

00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,570
on those lines I think that's that's

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:17,600
what i wanted to share today from the

00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:22,520
direct perspective as to how you can

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:26,630
develop an enterprise product so i had

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,730
any questions ok at that time of

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,310
building the community as you said so

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,450
what all challenges with the major ones

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:36,139
which you know

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:38,860
Redick looked as a hurdle towards it so

00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:41,179
building community is a you know it's

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,539
really crucial that have to be very

00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:46,929
transparent you know you cannot have

00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:51,019
discussions which are in closed loop

00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:55,039
mailing list or say with a small set of

00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:58,250
people right so when we have decisions

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,779
that are made in public and taking

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,789
everybody's considerations you know they

00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:04,429
it is bound to happen that there will be

00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:07,549
lot of objections debate and everything

00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:10,399
but if there are logical ways of

00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:14,120
explaining as to what is what is correct

00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:16,639
then you know then then it is very

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:20,630
fruitful because because you would have

00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:24,889
ruled out many of the problem that might

00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:28,850
come later at a very early stage so and

00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:31,730
another thing is you know it is always

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,649
good to see collaborating with community

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,929
that is already doing something rather

00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:37,460
than starting something on just because

00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,730
you know we are ready at or something

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:43,220
right so we always look at if you see we

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,899
work with OpenStack community right we

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,299
there's a lot of contributions from

00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:48,470
OpenStack even though you know we can

00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:51,080
just go ahead and start another

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,860
OpenStack kind of community but we try

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,970
we don't do that we really see that

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,460
collaborating with other communities is

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,669
the best way to go forward and which is

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:08,120
mutually beneficial I want question here

00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:10,549
yeah so I need an advice like if I wish

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,740
to be a contributor for OpenStack and

00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,870
next two years we made to start on it

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,049
where should I start and how should I

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:20,029
start I think the best way to look at it

00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:21,980
is you know there are many ways to

00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:24,289
contribute to open source right you can

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,500
be an evangelist versus you can be a

00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:30,350
hard core developer to somebody who can

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,440
test and report some of the issues right

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,779
so and you can be an architect pro but

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,419
but many of the things you know would

00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:41,029
require you to build credibility or a

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:45,860
period of time so that the community

00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:48,230
accepts so to start off I would say

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:53,480
you know aline know what your aptitude

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:55,250
is right and and align any of the skills

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,280
that are in line with your attitude

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,770
right so it is very important that your

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,420
aptitude is aligned with the skills that

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,640
you where you would want to contribute

00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,220
you might have interest to contribute

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,250
but if you don't have the aptitude then

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,580
it might not go take you pretty might

00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:16,580
not take you longer right so so I think

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,590
I think it is important that you get

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,059
that relation right and once you get the

00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,950
relation right you know there are many

00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:24,230
ways as I said from you Angeles to

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,640
whatever right start understanding the

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,770
understanding the product is good

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,990
building credibility that is being on

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,630
the mailing list being on the IRC

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:36,620
channels right and then trying to talk

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:38,360
to people and ask questions right in the

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,059
open world you know people might

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,070
criticize you that it says it's for

00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:45,830
something is it's not this list you know

00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:48,770
you just go ahead but that they are

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,270
actually correcting your course right so

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:53,540
don't take it in a negative way there

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:57,230
won't be all that nice all the time but

00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:02,210
but but they are always there to take

00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:05,299
you up to the next level right so did I

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,250
answer that okay also I would like to

00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:11,210
add to that question day before

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:13,520
yesterday we had a day of spring so yeah

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:19,960
if there is any also you can talk to the

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:22,640
people at the raider one of the things

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,200
when he asked about communities so i

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,760
think about communities is I've been

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,580
with red out for more than ten years and

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,190
when I started off with red hat we were

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,780
just an enterprise linux comfy now we

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,120
can't call ourself I enterprise linux

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,919
company anymore because we are in the

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,960
cloud we are into storage and we are in

00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,450
too many things so one of the lucky

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,179
things which Redick had draws it was

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,919
earlier on it was one of the only free

00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:49,429
and open-source companies which is

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,919
making money and most of our products

00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:54,140
are free in fact more ninety-nine

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,070
percent of our products of free the only

00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,540
products which are not free of the

00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,180
companies which we just acquire and we

00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,860
just try to see how we can open source

00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,980
those things for the mutual benefit of

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,360
and the second thing ye raat has been

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,570
successful even from a business

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,100
perspective is one of the core DNA's of

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,410
the companies we have an upstream first

00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,420
policy I'm stream first policy is

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,280
basically whatever code we contribute we

00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,260
send it upstream first to upstream

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,650
products like the Linux product or the

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,810
black community and all so like most of

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,460
us are software engineers for the first

00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,830
major thing about any software

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,620
proprietary or open-source software is

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,270
always a liability okay even if it's a

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,740
proprietary software or open source

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,680
software both software ship without

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,810
warranty as in it fails in your customer

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,730
premises it fails in productions none of

00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:43,280
these companies will provide a warranty

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:46,580
of your software being drunk so one of

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,710
the things which we do in that way is we

00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:52,760
try to not maintain many foals for

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,990
example many of you I mean you get in

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,210
your Python projects you have this

00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,530
requirement store text file okay which

00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,900
we pull which you pull into your

00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,420
projects okay although your application

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,600
requires only a few of it you are not

00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,430
maintaining all those 30 dependencies 40

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,010
dependencies in your project who

00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,840
maintains those dependencies if any of

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,120
those dependencies fail your project

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,390
also fails when I mean a liability these

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,740
are the liabilities so I mean a general

00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,150
perspective is there are about three

00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,970
million open source projects right now

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,800
of which only 20,000 make it to upstream

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,170
distributions like a Debian or a fedora

00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,330
of which only like five thousand make it

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,340
to a enterprise distribution like red

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,530
hat enterprise linux so why do you think

00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,600
there are three million software's and I

00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:38,540
mean can't we ship all of this only the

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,670
most stable ones do get shipped as an

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,040
enterprise product because as Redick we

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,320
we support these things for seven years

00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,360
so if you take a look at what's the

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,370
successful software project of what sir

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,690
unsuccessful software project these are

00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,090
a few things which you need to keep in

00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,400
mind and irrespective its propriety or

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:58,160
open-source few things are pretty common

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,420
for a successful software and one of the

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,610
things with the stability of your code

00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,170
you don't go on changing the you don't

00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,300
go on changing the interfaces in your

00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,650
code because there are many other people

00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,080
without your knowledge are using your

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,940
software providing stable interfaces

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,230
providing stable binding like most of

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,850
you know about water up

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,540
education programming interfaces are a

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:20,299
PA how many of you know what ABI use

00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:22,130
application binary interface so

00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:24,140
application binary interface is for

00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,910
example if you are writing a product you

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,820
won't go ahead and define what a printer

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,410
pandas Canopus you you accept the

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,140
operating system does the printer fin

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:35,840
the scanner for you ok you trust the

00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,700
operating system for it imagine the

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,280
developer says gee lipsy developer

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,690
decides to change printf from foo is

00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,640
equal to a plus b is equal to foo is

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,160
equal to B plus C okay as a definition

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,650
of printer although your although your

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,270
programs will behave the same there is a

00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,580
breakage in your code which is being

00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,350
consumed by our applications so these

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,520
are the type kind of things that you

00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,530
need to keep in mind when you're

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,890
building stable softwares our own

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:03,770
community stable stable communities also

00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:07,340
for example a small example is numpy how

00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:09,919
many of you have used numpy not many of

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,080
you know that there have been number is

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,440
one of the popular python scientific

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,840
applications of it but not of not many

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,929
people know the ABI of nampa hasn't

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,580
changed in 10 years what is the outcome

00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:24,830
of this now there are three big

00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,780
companies which are built around who

00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,419
have built softwares our own nampula n

00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,650
thought and thought has built software

00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:31,910
continuum io has built software and

00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,770
there are many popular projects like

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,690
pandas and all who have just used the

00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,820
numpy array to build a lot of softwares

00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,799
and their communities are wounded and

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,840
there are conferences like PI data the

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,760
syfy conferences are on this why do you

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,040
think this is just one small library

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,559
with a very stable interface so if your

00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,480
projects have that stable interface in

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,910
that then you can build stronger

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,290
communities stronger people come and

00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,179
contribute to this projects and even

00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,460
companies and Scratchy listeners so this

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,169
is one of the things about contributions

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,500
and how to make stronger communities

00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:05,090
from the software perspective where a

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,130
Python development from based out of

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:11,929
cochin kerala and just want to know if

00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:14,600
there are avenues for us to partner with

00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:16,549
Red Hat's products to take to our

00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,530
customers there's any way in which we

00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:24,140
can add value yeah definitely I think

00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:25,630
you know reddit if you go to reddit com

00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,810
/ partners in

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:32,410
their ways of associating attaching your

00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:35,430
company with with Redick and what what

00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:40,030
you can do is you know if you if you

00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:44,890
know people who if you know customers

00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:46,270
whose strengths and weaknesses then

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,850
probably you know you will be able to

00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:51,370
pitch your product with a red products

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:54,280
and whenever rats but understands your

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:56,290
business right so whenever there is a

00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,360
solution you know we have solution

00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:02,590
architects who go and create solutions

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,720
to the customers so if they see that

00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,910
your product is in line with somewhere

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,350
who is already a partner of red hat then

00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,780
there are definitely avenues that you

00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:14,980
can work with them and you know take

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,900
take it forward as the capacity to build

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,150
our teams using the beador's to this

00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,830
dist output so one other thing say if

00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,080
you want red our customers to use your

00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:26,230
product it's simple way when you build

00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,970
your software using the Python set up

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,830
dot five tools in it along with dis

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,690
tutorials and other thing you can build

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:34,150
out our pm's so once you build out our

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,250
themes you are not only testing it with

00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,890
the Python ecosystem you're also testing

00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,640
it with say rpm dis distributions the

00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,340
same thing with debian based

00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,370
distributions what happens is instead of

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,500
you trying to solve problems on every

00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,750
destroy the pythons build echo system

00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,790
builds it for every digital so that way

00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:55,150
you get access to the whole community of

00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:57,280
users which which testicles and if it's

00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:00,610
better it's open source for example each

00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:03,280
bug Red Hat solves in fedora or upstream

00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:05,500
likes a fedora or option OpenStack dot

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,930
org or on fedora that saves a lot of

00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,480
money as you are engaging the upstream

00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,850
open source community to a leverage to

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,010
find bugs and to fix bugs upstream

00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,450
itself before you support those

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:19,210
softwares so that's one way you can

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,560
start in engaging and if it's an

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,270
enterprise product yeah most of the

00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,340
enterprise the enterprise industry

00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:27,160
doesn't move as fast as your typical

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:29,050
software stacks because you know start

00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,960
of the software stacks change very fast

00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:34,180
because they re architecture in every 8

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,880
months 10 months but in enterprise stack

00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,890
it moves very

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,930
slow because the kind of customers who

00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,480
use these software's are banks

00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:44,180
governments stock exchanges where they

00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,850
don't want change their thing is more of

00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,200
stability than innovation yeah there is

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,390
a lot of innovation which happens but

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,010
it's not their higher priority is like

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,660
okay let's try a rewrite our application

00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,190
in Scala or no it doesn't because

00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,640
they're happy with C and they get

00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:00,230
performance and results yeah that's why

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,640
it's important that you know the right

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,850
kind of choices that you make the

00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,440
platforms that you work on in the

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,820
initial time where your software is

00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,280
going to sit on top of that particular

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:13,490
platform and the language of choice and

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,050
everything right so that that that is

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,520
really important because you set

00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:21,980
yourself for a more stable and more

00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,870
enterprise kind of a project which has

00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:27,260
the potential to become an enterprise

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:29,480
product right so so whatever the changes

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,100
that you see that a lot of innovation

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,320
that happens at the very initial stages

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,830
of the company but as you move forward

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,750
you know it definitely will have a slack

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,310
in terms of innovation but you rather

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,800
want to make it more stable and

00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:44,840
everything right so that's where you

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,240
shouldn't be struggling with oh ok we

00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,850
chose something when we started now we

00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:54,130
have to see do something else right so

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:56,180
that that's why that thought process of

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:59,890
thinking from an enterprise perspective

00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:02,420
really important it's not just the ideas

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,100
starting a new project or something one

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,660
of the one of the mistakes which I did

00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,830
earlier on being an open-source Ponte

00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,680
bitterest I never thought about

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:11,540
deployments to be frank okay thinking

00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,190
thinking about deployments from day one

00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,350
of your project who like for example

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,670
right now Python okay and just look at

00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,800
the way people are deploying Python

00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,690
software right now they deployed in a

00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,460
traditional way on bare metal the

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:24,500
deployed on VMS the deployed on

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,680
containerized applications it's very

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,150
heterogeneous as in one company I mean

00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,040
those days are gone where one company

00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,350
says use our own programming languages

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,360
use our own compilers deploy it on our

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,050
own servers right of the customers can

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,730
have everything

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,440
they can have a Microsoft kind of thing

00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,470
they can have BM wear and also they will

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,270
have linux okay it's the customers have

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,970
a choice of choosing how they want to

00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:49,430
deploy your software so if you write a

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,740
if you write your application and open

00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,750
at that you can deploy our containers

00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,750
you can deploy it by as a VM images

00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,700
everything you need to the more the more

00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,860
ways you can get customers to install

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,410
your software as one of the faster ways

00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,990
you can get adoption of your practices

00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,980
and the second thing is yeah I mean when

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,480
he asked about how many entrepreneurs

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,460
are there and how many want to be

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,230
entrepreneurs each of us are always

00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,270
learners and we are always entrepreneurs

00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,040
in some other way either you are trying

00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,110
to hype up yourself within your company

00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,760
showing your technologies or something

00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,980
so these are the changes which you need

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,540
to be aware of what's going on in the

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,460
industry what are the better practices

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,790
this one happens when you come to meet

00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,980
ups read the Python planets and also

00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:33,830
read the popular open Stoke aggregators

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,090
so you get to know how its evolved in

00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,400
like for example the containers

00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,440
everybody knows everybody wants to be in

00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,940
the container space but nobody there is

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,800
no clear idea okay I can make a

00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,600
container image but how am I going to

00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,640
have it in my data center are there

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,230
clustering things available does one

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,240
company provided doesn't mean there's

00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,430
many companies provided so those are the

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,080
kind of decisions but you need to take

00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,580
early around in your project as in

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,170
thinking about deployment from day one

00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,330
of your project gives you a better

00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,280
leverage over other software's much who

00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,600
don't think about their deployments so

00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,880
this is just have a exe file already

00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,070
empty file or some image up and say okay

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,039
we can deploy it anywhere self like

00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:13,740
those

00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:13,740
