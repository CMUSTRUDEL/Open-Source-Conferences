yeah good afternoon turn on Walter sent

00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:14,080
here my topic is novelist ml researcher

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,010
so for my I'm the research Internet's

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,160
AMA so this is my background and this is

00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:24,460
how I started my career with banking and

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,940
then I was with Deloitte doing financial

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,760
auditing then I was the founder of the

00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,610
stem a tech startup for almost seven

00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,739
years and then I became research in done

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,440
so you you're gonna hear about my

00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:40,390
journey so yeah what was the turning

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,550
point as I mentioned in the previous

00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,949
slide I'm the mentor for tech Novation

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,949
I'm an advocate of girls in technology

00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:49,899
and women in technology why you know

00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:52,690
yeah I can just take a look around and

00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,460
see how many women are among us it's not

00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,159
that women are not smart or intelligent

00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,719
or not in stem but there's somewhere you

00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,140
know we need to do lot of work to bring

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,440
in to stem so I was mentoring these two

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:08,909
girls Tanya and gorilla and we were one

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,189
of the finalists out of 10,000

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,500
participants in 125 countries and I had

00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:16,329
the opportunity to go to Google yeah I

00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,420
was there in the Google campus for five

00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:22,930
days and then it struck me really hard

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,880
okay as a promoter of women in

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,619
technology girls in technology and I'm

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,380
not in technology that's kind of you

00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:31,590
know very absurd so when I came back all

00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,799
I could see was all the AI in headlines

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,200
yeah

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,810
so I said like I'm gonna become a

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,060
technologist myself so it's really hard

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,890
to do something and keep doing at it and

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,859
it's also hard to start doing something

00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:47,079
right so yeah this is how it's gonna

00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:50,859
look like having known my background

00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:54,280
it's not so easy but I was prepared to

00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:57,039
do it yeah how many of you saw all the

00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,299
ML talks and AI talks in the last two

00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,920
days like yesterday and today and

00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:03,070
thought yeah maybe maybe I should get

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,869
into ml can you show up your hands how

00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,689
many of you think like yeah should I get

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:11,700
into ml yeah I'm gonna say anyone can do

00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:14,910
ml and DL yeah you can just search

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,180
MLA I in Google and these are some of

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,160
the things that that's going to come up

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,830
but yeah first say was my was to my

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,780
rescue and last year was my first spikin

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,599
I never knew something like that existed

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,010
before so last year was my first spikin

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:35,040
and this year I'm here talking to you

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:36,300
guys and girls so fast I it's I don't

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,870
know how many of you have heard about a

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,930
fast day I shock your hands that's good

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:48,000
and I keep telling Jeremy as my mentor

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:50,340
so why fast AI yeah it's a top-down

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,349
approach versus bottoms-up approach so

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,340
the basic thing I did was you know did

00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:58,500
of ml caused by Andrew ng and then I

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,110
went on to start deep learning because I

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,780
saw scikit-learn libraries you know to

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,579
do of it then treadeth not challenging

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,549
and not interesting enough and as a

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:10,410
woman at 40 trying to get into tech you

00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,599
know right how tough it is and with a

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,380
non-traditional background doing every

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,799
bit of you know finance entrepreneurship

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:23,340
so I thought I had to do something niche

00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,720
they started doing so yeah swimming you

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,420
learn swimming get into the water and

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,910
swim you want to play best football go

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,730
to the ground so this is what fast AI

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,739
preaches and if you look at all the blog

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,609
posts right so they'll teach how about

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,480
how to classify dogs versus pets and

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:42,660
identify the movie rate review

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,280
sentiments right so this is fast AI it

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,230
has like seven courses for the first

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,230
part one and then seven courses for part

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,940
two so you get to learn to build a movie

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,630
review sentiment recommendation

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,989
classifier

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,760
I mean recommendation engine building

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,150
and then classification and all that

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,389
stuff okay so all these concepts are

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,099
demystify and then you have discussion

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:07,709
forums you have a share your work here

00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:10,470
so what I wanted to I want to just give

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,260
like few lines about what I built I

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,590
didn't want to build a cats vs. dogs

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:20,459
yeah this is some bus in Bangalore

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,870
Karnataka yeah this is another bus so my

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,909
parents had the trouble of finding the

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,819
bus names when they travel outside of

00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:26,830
thumb

00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:30,310
so I wanted to build a bustling boat

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,259
classifier and as with all ML models I

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,530
had rough tough time you know finding

00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:38,319
data so I started taking a small problem

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,539
in my particular area in KK Nagar

00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,300
so I started hunting down for bus boats

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:44,110
right so I just go and start taking

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,169
pictures

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,620
I created my data set and then you know

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:53,500
I had so this this Murchison my data you

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,259
can just check it out and this is how I

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,960
went about pre processing the data and

00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:01,569
then I built a bus named boat classifier

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,639
in under like three months and the next

00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:06,190
thing I wanted to do I wanted to have a

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,379
text classifier say wanted to build a

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,259
successor marks classifier so again I

00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:12,969
went ahead and hunted data online I have

00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,680
built a data set anybody wants to work

00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:18,190
on you can reach out to me it's not made

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,550
public because again what there's a huge

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,530
bias right what appears normal to me may

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,620
not be appear normal to others so I'm

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,419
not made it public and can enter work as

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,969
an ml research of its sama and I thank

00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:33,520
Malay Kannan and some our team for

00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:37,529
believing in me and yeah if I can do it

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,529
