good afternoon to you all this is

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,360
surreal representing Erickson Gaia which

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,710
is a global AI accelerator unit for us

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,849
so as most of you know we are the

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,580
telecommunication infrastructure company

00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:21,900
so mostly at the back end whatever you

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,080
are using the operators right whether is

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,180
a Geo or a tailor or a phone so we are

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,490
not into the b2c space but what we see

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,699
is in the b2b space and what we are

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,769
going to talk in the next five minutes

00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,239
to excite you what kind of problems we

00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:39,269
are talking about in the AI ml space

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,409
where python is a backbone for us just

00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:42,750
like we are talking about we are

00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,949
backbone for the operators so python is

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,680
backbone for us when we were building

00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:48,390
the AI and m/l solutions so what we are

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,210
representing here we are building a team

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,589
of 300 data scientists globally even we

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,650
have presence in Chennai and Bangalore

00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:57,960
in India and in Silicon Valley and even

00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,269
in our headquarter Sweden so what is our

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,580
main charter for us is how do you

00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:04,710
accelerate the execution of the strategy

00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,930
using the AI we are using lot of core

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,610
maybe a lot of hype is there but on the

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,810
AI but when we see the real world

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,460
applications what I will walk you

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,840
through in the interest of time maybe

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,600
four five minutes but we do have our

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,700
booth g8 for more detailed discussions

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,229
I'll encourage you to come there and we

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,060
are trying to build the critical mass of

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,229
the competence and we are trying to

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,420
innovate in the space through automation

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:28,710
evolution and growth so we want to

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,659
change the portfolio of the Ericsson

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,969
this is what use we call it as a AI

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,399
brain so what we are talking about the

00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,689
interesting point here is as you see

00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,009
maybe there are different layers both

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,289
from the product side and the service

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,939
side what we mean by the product side is

00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:44,399
as you see we are providing the

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,960
infrastructure of a radio IP core at

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,460
each stage is not just only at an

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,140
application level do a summary kind of a

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,249
recommendation or do a prediction but we

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,009
are talking about the interesting

00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:54,869
problems to solve it each level and that

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,149
we at scale even if you take example of

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,729
a Chennai we can easily guess we have

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,249
one lakhs particular towers whatever we

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,329
see okay so from different operators and

00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:05,490
when at the end of the day we are

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,049
talking about terabytes of data with us

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,420
which may be structure that is one way

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,819
of looking at and another other side if

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,940
you see we do have a lot of towers and

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,040
cells which you see physically there how

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,090
do you ensure the quality of service so

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,450
whenever you are making call you are

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,040
make

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,290
sure that okay you are trusting the

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,660
network entities you are able to talk

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,450
with the agreed quality of service so to

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,129
do that we have continuous measurement

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,470
of the activities right at the radio

00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,660
level and at the core level and network

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,640
planning level now even with the IOT so

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,470
whatever we are seeing that to see 3G

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,180
and even Phi G is coming up so that is

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,430
one part of the story second thing is

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,810
how you are managing the services so one

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,730
is disp and the infrastructure planning

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,170
and network planning level where we are

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,180
talking about a lot of automation and

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,060
optimization we are trying to do at the

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,640
same time if I go for a specific example

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,290
let's say I want to predict okay maybe a

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,849
lot of crowd is here and then what kind

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,260
of quality of service we can promise and

00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:00,269
what kind of break our predictive

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,079
actions we can take when we have the

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,060
information right it may be

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,519
configuration changes or it may be

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,040
having the specific parameters which are

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,260
maybe root causes for that all this we

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,180
are trying to do with the Python being

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,890
the backend if I walk you through a

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,000
specific use case for instance we are

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,130
talking about the structured data one

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,170
side and even this other side we are

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,370
talking we have a lot of infrastructure

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,859
how do you maintain it's not like a

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,359
human task these guys needs to climb if

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,120
you talk about the field engineer the

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,829
tens of meters to see if the

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,750
infrastructure is intact but why can't

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:32,280
we use the drone images that is maybe a

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,139
starting point for us and a lot of

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,280
visual intelligence applications even

00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,109
though we are talking about a couple of

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,639
applications here which is not limited

00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,840
to this one if I take one example of

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,569
weather proofing where we are doing a

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,180
live demo of object detection using

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:47,130
Python which we built it if you see

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,630
there is an exposed part so which may be

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,519
because it is in the outside in the

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,290
environment so what we are talking here

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,639
is how do you make sure that okay there

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,380
are these kind of classes whether it is

00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,970
a bending to match or maybe they are

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,370
exposed to components which may affect

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,130
us finally when we are making really a

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,269
call or maybe our 4G data so these are

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,660
the interesting points which we are

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:09,540
talking about solving it in our real

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,310
real world in interest of time we are

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,900
not going to many details but let me it

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,700
is not like we are consumers of the

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,720
Python or maybe the open source

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,609
community women we are kind of

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,900
contributing back we do have active

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,820
volunteers who are contributing it as i

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,770
could learn our Python packages at the

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,840
same time you can visit github.com /

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,789
lyrics and we do have more 80-plus

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,900
resources not some may be telecom domain

00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,550
if you are coming from telecom you can

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,620
use it but there are open source for

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,530
instance if I can quote one example

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,330
VA Eriksen video annotator so that is

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,280
one of the less built on Python so you

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,870
can access those and give us the

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,120
comments and we encourage you to visit

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,260
our booth for more detail applications

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,260
