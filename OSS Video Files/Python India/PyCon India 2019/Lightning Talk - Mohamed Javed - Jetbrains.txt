hello everyone okay I think you're all

00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,190
tired already

00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:16,270
okay aunt from JetBrains and part of

00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:20,290
jetbrains team based out of India so how

00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:23,800
many of you heard of jetbrains Wow that

00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:28,270
motivates me okay and how many of you

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,329
tried PyCharm okay I'm in front of the

00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:35,649
right audience then so not just by chung

00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:37,420
we have multiple products for multiple

00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:40,510
languages and we have a Kotal in

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,719
language itself and team tools this how

00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:46,359
we grew from IntelliJ starting with

00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,239
IntelliJ IDEA the company was known then

00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:52,269
IntelliJ and then we grew with multiple

00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:57,519
products and pycharm if you see that was

00:00:52,269 --> 00:01:00,339
in down the line and so we have multiple

00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:02,260
tools IDs for different languages for

00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:04,420
your favorite languages that's so so

00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:09,280
quickly I'm just how many of you try

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,990
used Jupiter notebooks great so I'm

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,850
going to talk about I'm going to show a

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,260
quick demo of Jupiter notebooks

00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,260
integration where the pycharm

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:31,409
so you go so first we launch a new

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,060
project and limit say Pisa because this

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,049
is the the datasets which you are gonna

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,439
use this of Pisa company nappies outlets

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:44,939
in us so have you ever tried checked out

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:48,090
this tip of the day no I'll get a couple

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,600
of folks great so this is a pretty

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,179
useful feature from buy Chum a offers

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,679
avoided but you know everyday choose it

00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:58,350
if every time you open it shows a tip

00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:59,939
which is very useful it shows shortcuts

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,770
multiple shortcuts and everything you

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,409
know right in a charm you don't need to

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,149
use moves at all we just need to use the

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,360
keyboard for the demo purpose I'm gonna

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,630
show the the most I'm gonna use a mouse

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,049
so there's a notebook which we are

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:20,519
creating we are gonna create a new

00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:26,549
directory which is notebooks and gonna

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:29,160
have a file created Pisa by thorne file

00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,019
and if you see immediately it choose the

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,570
Jupiter package is not installed so

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:36,540
that's what my son does so it helps you

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,549
when you code so it asks you suggest you

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,760
to install a Jupiter package when you

00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:44,430
type i py + B and the final name and

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,180
then immediately it helps you with the

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:54,840
package it directly downloads to the

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:59,420
pycharm so I'm just taking a data set a

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,420
couple of data sets from kragle

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,110
so I'm just defining

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,090
and then now we are let's investigate

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,520
the data sets which we have so we will

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:23,470
use how many columns and how many rows

00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:25,870
and it is it shows that so for the quick

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:33,430
reference I'm taking the the codes from

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:36,610
the already recorded one so if you see

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:39,790
here it's a 10,000 lines rows with 24

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:44,950
columns and if we go through the columns

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,180
there are many unnecessary columns which

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,530
we can eliminate that's the most

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,870
important thing is of cleaning the data

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,690
set which we have right so if we see

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,140
that you are the country I believe it is

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,760
since we took it from the u.s. used

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,160
market probably the country should be

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,170
everything should be us so we can

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,640
probably ignore that remove that so

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,970
that's what we are trying to do we are

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,570
checking the count and it is if you see

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:12,250
it's thousand so that means that we have

00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,570
thousand proves that means everything is

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:19,600
us so we can simply remove that and then

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,660
if you and also we can clear some

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,700
unnecessary sets like IDs and price

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:32,650
range US USD the price the currency we

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:37,470
can remove those and then we will expand

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,470
the abbreviation for the states

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,960
and then if you next we'll just try to

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,930
get a plotted in a you know Pisa chart

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,490
and if you see it doesn't work because

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,349
that's when you need to use the magic

00:04:52,490 --> 00:05:01,520
word Matt plot library so that's what

00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:04,370
I'm trying to do and then okay the most

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,130
again if you notice we can use cells

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,479
different cells in in PyCharm you just

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,220
need to use command shift and enter

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,120
ultimately it creates a new cell and

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,410
every cell is is compiled at a time so

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
you don't have to compile everything

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:23,620
together run everything together it is

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:29,000
just that cell can be run separately and

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:33,699
then we see here we use this and we have

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,470
the chart so not just a chart it does a

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,680
pie chart but also we can what we can do

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:44,289
is we can plot it on a map so what we

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,810
can do is we can take help from properly

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:49,580
so we use it but still it shows a Panera

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,500
but again it helps you with all the

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,750
information saying that hey Bradley is

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,000
missing just you need to input and then

00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:00,280
it immediate immediately it imports that

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,380
and this is how it looks the chart looks

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,610
right so that's a very quick demo of how

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:10,389
PyCharm works and how we integrate a

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,389
jupiter notebook

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:20,440
and you can find all the information

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:23,800
here yeah and thank you so you can find

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,330
the data set the codes and if you need

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,220
an evaluation I mean if you want to try

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,690
with the Jupiter notebook you can mail

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,700
us we'll help you with a couple of

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,200
months evolution license and for

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,670
students it's you have the free license

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,870
thank you look forward to meet you at

00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,870
