hi my name is Subin I'm not about here

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,980
I'm at the audience es undergraduate

00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,000
student so I have this 4b project called

00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,799
self fear day

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,290
so what is self is self your days

00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:26,360
basically yeah so it is a hobby project

00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,690
where a person takes a selfie every day

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,550
and we combines it and I combine these

00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,879
self images to make a time-lapse video

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:38,060
so why do I do this is because it's a

00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,800
fun project and you can actually use

00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,660
that I just use that as a journal like

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,010
you know how you write journal for

00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,420
everyday what happened in your event

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,100
that's boring ready of the write a

00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,570
bishop but instead if you just take a

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,050
picture and you can see who the people

00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,630
you were with

00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,100
like which place you were in so I

00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,450
started this wedding with Joe in college

00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,520
so that's when I started going to tech

00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,010
conferences and going to events like

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,260
this so I take a selfie at some place

00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:04,750
somewhere and I can know what happened

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:07,100
during my life like back then you so so

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,600
somebody also already did this project

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,950
to make this time-lapse video I use

00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,960
Python to make this timeless you do

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,600
so what Python does is that I use the

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,080
Python to make this some some other guy

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,540
made this root he used each images faces

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,760
correctly centered it's correctly

00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,979
standard to make a good tonight and I

00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,200
saw a best example of this is I think

00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:29,150
you probably seen this in YouTube maybe

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,280
it's a very famous video so what this

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,350
guy did was he took his pictures since

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,479
he was 10 years old years old till the

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,720
age he was married so that's like 12

00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,850
years of images so what how he did this

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,560
mean in a video was that he manually

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,110
placed each picture in a video editor

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,460
that's that took him like many days of

00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:51,920
work so this is like about this tall

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,049
like 10 15 years of images you still

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,369
doing this project and I've been I saw

00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,590
this I was like wow this is so awesome

00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:58,850
like you can see how he grows up as he

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,619
grows older and older and how the people

00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:05,680
go yeah but who driver back in this

00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:05,680
thing

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,780
so the problem is nothing in here - man

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,760
Willie place each image one-by-one and

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,890
edit that in video that's so boring and

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,990
that's so time-consuming then there

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,850
comes Python and I made a script I mean

00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,140
some other guy made a scream I meant the

00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,590
script more better

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,880
so all it required is then I still don't

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,640
know how this code works because it's

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,990
much complicated and I would really like

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,400
some contributors you help me with this

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,430
project because there are some problems

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,170
with it so if I take this take my for

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,760
tour like with some other people like

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,170
multiple face features if there are some

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,060
other people in this with me the

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,300
script gets confused say which face

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,010
should be used to align the image so I

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:47,310
think the solution would be like - the

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,769
script can automatically find which

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,550
image - I mean which face to align to

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:56,310
and it is currently slow and I need to

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,070
make the fossa and what I did extra in

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,930
this rapport is that there's some less

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,959
another problem with that script like if

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,360
I changed my phone in between so my old

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,860
phone had the resolution of about 2000

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,860
something but but I knew one had a

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,239
resolution of 4000 pick the width so

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,670
this cause problem with the script that

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,560
the image aligning could didn't work so

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,310
what I did was I I had to make another

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,140
script to resize all the images and and

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,390
make sure that that also has to the new

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,950
script so if anybody of you is

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,810
interested to help me with this wallet I

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,459
can give you the data set so I started

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,640
this one year ago currently I have about

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,860
500 pictures 500 days of pictures and I

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,549
want to show you what I the end result I

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:42,799
have write it okay and I was showing

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,799
this to mother people before so

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,480
reopen this file again sheet

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,129
so I started so I shaved my head at the

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:04,489
first past picture then after my hair

00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:05,780
that's all older so this is actually

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,170
about one year of pictures one error

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,170
free tonight

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,470
and another fix I did was that the when

00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,019
there are multiple people in the

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,000
pictures what I just modified the script

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,010
to make it a line on the biggest face

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,780
like the largest face but then another

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,150
problem came like if someone else has a

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,580
bigger picture of mine then that face is

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,900
aligned so there were problems with that

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,580
yeah and then my mother brother also

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,550
shaved my head later and she already

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,780
said later so that's why I called it and

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,860
I would really like some contributors to

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,110
help you this was it because I'm

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,570
planning to take this I'm planning to

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,980
continue with this for many years so and

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,060
if anybody or for you interest you to

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,640
also do is there's also read big

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,070
community you can answer you can find a

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,930
reddit community for this but the

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,490
problem is it is hard like to keep

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,440
aligning these images so this crypt will

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,120
may will be helpful for many other

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,280
people too and there is also some

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,860
Android apps currently someone helps us

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,360
build but that's much more complicated

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,400
Python descript is much easier to use

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,410
but it's nice improvement so this is

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,000
actually for coffee for coffee for okay

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,340
so all the other people helped me with

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,640
this project so yeah that's what I did

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,640
