she

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:24,180
okay so the next presentation is about

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:27,390
deployment and user 6509 increase of

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,369
Terry's performance the topics I'll

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,140
cover a little bit about myself about

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,600
the motivation for the piece of the cook

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,850
dark important and talk about some of my

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,489
experiences between points59

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:45,330
infrastructure about use of XY now in

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:48,690
significance in services and I was

00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,540
touching my conclusions as working with

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,850
free software solutions in the area x5

00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:57,420
man he'll also leave some time for the

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,839
profession analysis session so a little

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,320
bit about myself first of all I used to

00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:06,030
have hair cut out of it so this was

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,510
before I started dealing with system

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:14,280
administration nvm if you've got still

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:16,560
some care just get off train okay I'm

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,950
count from Belgrade Serbia I'm system

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,960
administrator system integrator and I

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:27,090
also da little bit of programming but

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,100
only on the free software and I'm a big

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,290
free software support I try to use free

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:37,420
software than average

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:40,730
and I have a great interest in TGI so

00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,820
motivation for the Good Book what I

00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,370
wanted was to deploy who placed a

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,729
software solution that would encompass

00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,740
the x 59 infrastructure including the

00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:54,440
services like certification Authority

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,430
ccp responder sierra distribution points

00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:03,020
and certificate repositories then I

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:05,479
wanted to deploy x19 in services using

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,590
certificates for both authentication and

00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:15,680
authorization inserts like may a map

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:19,120
activity with the ants web servers I

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,650
once wanted to do it at the first time

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,000
basically I wanted to try a solution

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,190
that can compete with some of the

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,120
proprietary products like coming tonight

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:35,769
the end similar companies so on to be x1

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,450
IT infrastructure the infrastructure is

00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:41,540
Asian thorities I hope it is basically

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:48,200
just easy BCA and for some of the

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:50,810
openssl implants as a client utility so

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,650
some of the requirements cookies EG pca

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:58,459
you would need a jdk six you'll need the

00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:02,269
jboss for example jboss application 750

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:04,310
mg and even leave the database the

00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:07,519
database i prefer a mysql and postgresql

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,190
of course easy peasy can work with the

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,629
other types of databases well including

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:18,360
the

00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:20,069
tilting database so some of the

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,439
interesting parts as I was deployed to

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,250
disable them basically you have a

00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:29,010
bootstrap process when you join me GBC

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,409
since EDC itself depends on use of

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,989
certificates forever ministration and

00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:36,659
for setting it up you have a chicken and

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,609
egg problem so the booster process helps

00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,829
you to actually set up an initial car

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,959
marque deploy in administration's

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,389
educational Tony which can then issue

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,099
key stores thrusters and super

00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,829
administration's taking it broken and

00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:54,739
afterwards you want to set up the

00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:58,079
certificate profiles which basically

00:03:54,739 --> 00:04:00,810
come where all the technical details

00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,760
related to significant usages and some

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,790
of the technical stuff like the OC

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,359
experience for general URL like CL

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:13,230
distribution locations and key sizes

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:16,289
stuff like that and finally you do they

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,079
identify the intensity profiles and then

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,750
the profiles actually the determine

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,360
what's the contents of a certificate

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:28,220
like what's in subjective certificate

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,220
spots in subject anatomy

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,990
also at some point you might want to

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,930
actually migrate your temporary

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:42,350
hierarchy you might actually want to

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:45,200
help each PC using the new successful

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,420
stories which are deployed like root

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,490
certification Authority maybe we'll

00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,280
gather a server simplification of

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,060
Dorothy and you will want to migrate

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,360
into bc itself this hub so you will need

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,950
to issue a new key stored restores and

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,590
you will need to issue new super

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,840
administration credentials you also need

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:08,900
to set up a GBC a to actually recognize

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,170
these new credentials the critical thing

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:15,050
is that you can find yourself locked out

00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:19,870
of the system at one point did happen to

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:23,060
know I mark the certain certificate

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:26,030
extension as critical and the Mozilla

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,670
Firefox wasn't a processes and I didn't

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,970
back up the old keystore do trust or any

00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,110
process so for example you can you want

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,970
to be careful when you're defining

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:40,280
Street certificate profiles on to the

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,120
positive stuff about the DBC a there's

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:48,050
plenty of option and expire about that

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:51,290
you have a lot of inline comments in the

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,690
configuration files and you can quite

00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,990
decent user administration manual and

00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:01,010
everything that you need on a negative

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:04,370
side currently it has quite a blanket

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:06,950
web interface the web interface is going

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:10,640
to work in progress so there will be

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:13,540
some problems in this area and in actual

00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,920
ax use a client certificate

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,100
authentication for authenticating to

00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,100
some of the external service

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,850
for example you want to push

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:26,190
certificates into an elder directory it

00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:30,270
can only support use of a username and

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,820
password you also want to pay attention

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,060
when you're picking the JDK you want to

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,940
graphic or communicate in my views sucks

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,820
a little if you hear if you are trying

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,040
to deploy any kind of test system with

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,100
the small little machines it will

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,650
actually face the tour of jdk that's

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,620
quite a huge memory consumption in its

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:56,370
default configuration you also have the

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,520
JC policy stuff which basically means

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:03,180
that during any upgrades of jdk you must

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:08,760
pay attention that you kept replaced the

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:10,890
form to JC policy in in the order to

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,460
dedicate or if you don't do that

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:18,150
basically things start falling apart in

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,400
case of openjdk or iced tea a number of

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,240
times i've seen people caring problem

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,820
with the javascript support me included

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:30,720
basically openjdk iced tea use the Rhino

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:33,060
project and some distributions actually

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,570
might not include a JavaScript support

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,190
in the jdk in the ICT or openjdk for

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,470
example if you're using a genital system

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,780
and you try to install the ICT binary

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,840
package if you lack support for the

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:49,200
JavaScript and the ants targets which

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,080
are used for going to be saved you'll

00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,259
fail

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,569
now on to the ocsp responder I use the

00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:59,990
GBC again it's just basically the same

00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:06,500
requirements as in case of setting up

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:10,009
certification Authority some of the

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,530
highlights you will need to define a

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:15,860
separate ocsp certificate profile well

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:18,199
you will want to designate extended to

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,090
use each course is a signer so that

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:25,490
actually you can use the ocsp responder

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:30,139
you almost need to provide all the ocsp

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:32,959
key stores you deployed in stores in one

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:36,950
or CSP boxes Vicki store / certification

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,899
Authority in Vicki CS performance and

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,200
the important thing that you must

00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:45,339
remember is that passwords across across

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,720
those pkgs valve files must all match

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:50,660
because you can only provide a single

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,910
passport when you are deploying the ocsp

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,620
in case of Education when you're

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,130
deploying ocsp you're providing the

00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:00,890
password for the key source you will

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,199
also need to synchronize the initials is

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:07,370
be dismissed by hand now the thing is

00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:09,380
that essentially a part of each PC

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,199
certification Authority database is

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,240
actually kept the DSP responder so any

00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:16,670
information about certificates and their

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,529
validity is actually kept in the

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:24,680
unchanged for money OCC OCC respond the

00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:28,250
database so this manual synchronization

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,800
actual includes dumping the database and

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,709
importing

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,240
one on our server and we will want to of

00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:38,110
course even if you set up an automatic

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:41,080
publisher so that whenever some

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,450
significant gets revoked or gets issued

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,690
if you love it should automatically be

00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:50,130
pushed into the ocsp day Nicholas II

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:52,570
GBCs can support for actually making

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,970
publishing cues so if for some reason

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,660
you are unable to publish a certificate

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,519
the ocsp database you may set up

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:05,800
services which will periodically we try

00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:09,250
that's that do you think we need to be

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,990
seized at all ocsp is that it's easy to

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,660
deploy it's much easier to deploy and

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,329
certification authority of course it's

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,570
easy maintained because it's easy to

00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:23,440
understand I mean basically you can just

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:26,470
copy copy of a of a single 12 tables

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,310
from the GBC certification authority on

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,410
gdocs be responsible so you can actually

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,570
easily debug some of the problems if

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,329
you're a little bit worse with the SQL

00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,889
you can perform cut up custom queries to

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:43,309
figure out what's happening with some

00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:46,279
and if pretty much works as advertised I

00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:51,259
haven't seen any problems using visits

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:52,970
as all CHP responder except that the

00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:56,569
national database synchronization feels

00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:59,720
the funky because you need to manually

00:10:56,569 --> 00:11:02,029
synchronize it it will be probably a

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,309
good idea traction Java command line

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:08,419
interface which would perform this

00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:10,790
operation for you since all information

00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:13,459
about us ESP database like credentials

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:17,959
usernames are already present a

00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:20,449
declaration files next line is Cyril

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:23,839
distribution point I've concentrated

00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:26,299
myself Muslim using a web server because

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,929
that's just the simple space that you

00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:32,179
can distribute zeros and you can use any

00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:34,489
kind of herbs and apache engine X like

00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:37,699
this with it there's not this really not

00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:39,410
much to do just serving files and you

00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:42,889
will need to use some kind of file

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:50,419
transfer methods like using guess we

00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:53,779
should be basically ftv anything you you

00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:55,129
will do bc supports custom Cyril

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,079
publishers that means that you can

00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:58,730
actually write your own by the way or

00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:01,639
scripts which will be published in the

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:05,360
sierras anywhere or doing anything with

00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:07,519
0 0 0 it's received it should receive a

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,799
single argument and that's a part you

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,799
are there uncoded cyril file

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:18,510
the good thing is once you deploy this

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,490
script you need to set up custom serial

00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,200
publisher and you will need to assign

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,360
this is general publisher to a number of

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,460
different certification authorities of

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,790
course you can have multiple publishers

00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,950
which are pushing zeros and different

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,490
service depending on which gives

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:37,290
authority you are processing the

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:40,560
positive thing is that this kind of scam

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:43,650
is very very flexible because you can

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,000
use for example processing of cereal

00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:50,640
contents so if you define some kind of

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,590
hierarchy between the district Sierra

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:57,660
and the do patient zero can be found you

00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:04,560
can actually automate this if you have

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:07,200
like Sierra example calm / country /

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,450
location you can actually extract this

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,180
information using a simple scripts and

00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:15,180
then automatically create a destination

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,300
but you can also use any problem that

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,880
you like 45 transfer which is which

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,470
allows you quite a bit of flexibility

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,270
and of course you can use any

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,120
programming language or scripting

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:31,470
language which can be executed monkeys

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,260
education Authority side the negative

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,390
thing is something that maybe cereal is

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,020
always providing in there for me so you

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,610
can tell ABC to provide in that moment

00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,110
but

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:51,910
course you need feminism converts

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:51,910
initial zero used like common I details

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,529
when come comes to pick it fosters I've

00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:01,970
used open number and open up is

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:05,180
sufficient just for itself for or what

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,690
ideas did basically I wanted to care but

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,970
all the classic it's stored in the

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:17,450
database so that users can touch the

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:20,990
certificates or encryption purposes the

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:22,930
important aspects of deploying open

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,399
alder and using you to be see with it is

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,010
generally to have a good certificate in

00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:31,310
subject distinguish may nothing every

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,570
entry in an elder tree gets

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:37,399
distinguished name which uniquely

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:40,010
identifies it if you have a good pattern

00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:45,730
he set up you can actually perform more

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:48,589
or less one-to-one map you can set up

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,690
when you're setting out at publisher you

00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:54,949
have two options you can set up the

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:57,740
plane elder partnership which basically

00:14:54,949 --> 00:15:01,579
specified our bassist English name like

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:05,000
DC equals people d c equals example b c

00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:07,010
equals calm and then you just like the

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,519
attribute from certificates to use for

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:13,190
marking so if you're depending on user

00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,649
ID you can actually enter it okay use

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:19,579
your user ID and you end up with

00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:21,649
something like you ID equals Bronco DC

00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:23,390
post people's this impulse example this

00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:26,430
equals

00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:29,670
it's also possible to use the map search

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:32,670
partnership which allows you to perform

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,540
this mapping to your own antiquary so if

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:38,400
you do not have a one-to-one mapping

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,560
like the one I described you can

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,230
actually specify a custom and the prayer

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,910
that will be executed to figure out this

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,580
nation distinguished name but the

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:51,900
certificate should be stored that are

00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,850
kept this in one case where there was a

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:59,400
requirement the certificate certificate

00:15:53,850 --> 00:16:03,090
should hold a personal number and I need

00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:08,670
the it was stored in the user ID field

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:11,400
in uie unique ID but I wanted to use

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:14,400
that same thing for the username so i

00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:18,420
had a small conflict which i resolved by

00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,820
providing i have used different extent

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,140
develops camera so i used the employee

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,670
number field in the other and actually

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,530
trying to figure out what wasn't

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:35,700
destination ticket destination he and

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:39,720
try perform that search the positive

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:43,230
thing is that using open a lot for this

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,240
is it's quite flexible depending on the

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,230
structure of certification policies is

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,230
that you set up

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,019
you can create custom I layouts and

00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,940
everything and you can integrate it into

00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:56,880
existing outlet trick so if your

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,430
organization already has an Outlook tree

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,910
you can do most pole in seamlessly

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:07,470
integrate storing the users encryption

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:10,689
certificates in other three of course

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:15,400
still the important thing is near

00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:16,959
traumatic the negative thing is that as

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,299
I said before you can't use my

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,350
certificates or ten skating against we

00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:25,120
open up observer the there was a current

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,189
leaders a small republishing bug that's

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,380
presence if you are attempting to

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:30,880
publish certificate staff that have

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:35,500
already been stored in the other two

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:38,020
directory you will in out up you must

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:42,940
became a symbol distinguished name you

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:46,350
must have a unique key value combination

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,570
that painlessly completely unique and

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,299
the GPC is currently not processing that

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,700
step but the good thing is that there is

00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:57,070
a patch pending I've actually written

00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,770
that patch I'm not a Java developer but

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:02,740
I've managed to put something together

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:06,210
and the ticketing is also that there are

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:11,320
actually two more alternative solutions

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:15,460
to the patch i agree to this back now

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,320
moving on to the smart cards well first

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,419
of all tells you if you want to use it

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,470
for any kind of sign incorporation

00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:30,370
persistent authentication for San gmail

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:32,530
Nina's you Nuala needs spotted leader

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,080
even lead pcs you like to communicate

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,970
with smart card readers in the smart

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,990
card itself you will need the for

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,780
example leave it ccid but that's private

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:46,720
for CCAD compliant readers and in most

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:51,309
cases you actually want to target fully

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:54,130
compliant ccid smart card reader there

00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:58,179
are some cases like on the key or

00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:00,460
current here which which are kind of

00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,500
scan is easy and you compliant as long

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,950
as you don't use the extended apt use

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,409
commands it all works ok so the moment

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:12,429
you start using it extended apdu

00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:15,580
commands it starts to fail which happens

00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:18,250
usually if you use a bit larger keys or

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:23,190
when generating a lot larger keys on the

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:26,080
smart card and the important thing to

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:29,020
probably only have also applicatio salon

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,140
provider that's what i used open SC

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,470
project supports a number of different

00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:37,450
different cards and the important thing

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:41,409
is to keep in mind that you might need

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,870
different software versions depending on

00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:46,510
which kind of smart card or smarter

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:52,450
business you can select it so it can be

00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:53,830
a bit struggling now well some pilots

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,190
and it comes off using smart guys

00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:00,100
usually you first erase the card then

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:03,309
you initialize the piggies Vicki cs50

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,080
instructors on it then you might at your

00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:08,559
option create additional user in codes

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,840
like you can have different user pin

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,260
protecting the signing certificate and

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,600
encryption certificate afterwards you

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,370
want to generate keys and smart card use

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,830
that key to generate a certificate

00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,570
signing request use certificate signing

00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,210
request to obtain a certificate from

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,789
certification Authority and then you

00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:32,620
stole this client certificates on smart

00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:34,720
guard the good thing about smart cards I

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,559
will mention some of the cards at work

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,370
quick so I went through my eid it does

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,500
feature which is called security officer

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:47,140
when you are initializing event from

00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,679
ikea IE you can specify security offered

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:53,559
officer pincode security officer it's

00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,929
kind of user management so like you can

00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:59,289
security officer you can use in case of

00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:01,450
smart cards security officer is a person

00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:04,059
is an entity which is allowed to do

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,240
anything to the car so once the card has

00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:10,030
been created the initials and everything

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,120
only the security officer is allowed to

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,309
erase the guard or perform some of the

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,679
other operations when the user is still

00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:21,159
of course entitled to regularly use of

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,309
smart cars there is it also has support

00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,980
funds for finalization which requires

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:28,240
the security of the support

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,150
finalisation is approximated when you

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,730
tell smartcut to lock itself down so the

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:37,570
only security officer can perform some

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:39,550
of the more sensitive operations and we

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,560
could think about the vent my idea that

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:44,950
these supports multiple use of spins or

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,770
slots so that's one of the cases where

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:50,010
you can actually define different pin

00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:53,830
codes for encryption and signing

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:57,310
certificates there's also patient picky

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,750
i and ii pass 2003 the nice thing is

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,980
that there are tickets are available

00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:05,770
from you see you so if you're actually

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:09,760
intends to develop and some cows support

00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:13,360
the use of pgcs 11ins use a smart card

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,740
is a free software you can get a free

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,510
token from both you and there's a lot of

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,460
tools for working with smart cards

00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,520
primal come come from the open st

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:27,760
project code for money manipulating the

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:32,170
pkgs 15 structures or working with pgcs

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,030
alarm libraries and of course this

00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:38,280
continue that works to support more and

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:42,460
more currents the negative thing is that

00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,680
in case you should be pind pass 2003 it

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:48,240
doesn't have a security officer sport

00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,560
and it doesn't support finalization

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,250
finalization depends on the Security

00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,260
office of support and

00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:59,650
these items are actually work in

00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:04,070
progress another one flaw is that either

00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:09,950
it's not maybe a fault but it was just a

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:12,560
single user pincode one false is also

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,960
that you might need to recompile open

00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,890
SCP GCS 11 provider in the library

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,370
itself in case of newer cards which can

00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,810
be a little bit distribution friendly

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:27,410
because you may need to be mixing

00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:29,270
different versions from my case I get to

00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:34,430
backport some of the packages from the

00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:36,740
debian testing on the debian squeeze I'm

00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:40,070
nicety of would be prompted to have some

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,290
kind of modular runtime support where

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,440
you would simply provide a module for

00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:47,600
certain card which the open SC aqui es

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,780
lo and widened simply load at the

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,150
runtime depending on extensive there's

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,300
also a big lack of user friendly

00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:58,310
documentation it is very hard to get

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,860
started working with smart cuts both in

00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:04,120
case of the mouth and 10 integrations so

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:08,950
that's that's not another Easter Island

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:12,220
now moving on to the use of X 19 in

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:15,290
services I will first talk a little bit

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:19,040
about system authentication using the

00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:21,290
bumpy gsm mobile you will need of course

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,360
mark adrenals market pcsc like

00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,210
communicate

00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:31,030
both of those and a big ecs 11 provider

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:33,000
I use the open SC and of course what you

00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,650
need to define is first the trust angle

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,770
you can provide it in one of two ways

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:42,760
you can either provide a single file in

00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:44,890
ten-forward base64 encoded or you can

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,250
provide an openness style cash /

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:51,040
diversity in case of sierra you also can

00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:56,470
provide a single hand file or you can

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,970
use the openssl style cash library then

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,700
you need to define the written

00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:04,180
verification checks that the pump nick

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,850
is just launched the phone funky CSL and

00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:10,210
supports a number of different education

00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:12,580
steps like it can of course validate to

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,650
the chain of trust it can validate the

00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,710
signature so it can actually request

00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,600
from the user to enter pin code and

00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:22,560
design something with the smart card to

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,450
verify that presently certificate is

00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:28,120
really in correlation with the private

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:31,630
key stone this quarter and it can

00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,240
perform crl checks it supports three mas

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,060
works see objects on find online and

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,160
automatic offline is when you sit down

00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,100
with zeros to something behind directory

00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:45,610
until it's to read zeros from their

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,470
online allows MPG CSO able to extract

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,950
the serial distribution point from the

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:52,810
certificate and download the crl and the

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,390
validation certificate using that

00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,730
downloaded 0 and automatic is basically

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,730
a fallback mode first try the online if

00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:03,470
online sales go to the

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,830
it also supports multiple tracks of

00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,900
course you can find all all these three

00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,880
types of jacks or you can exclude one of

00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,530
those tracks which is quite useful if

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:17,570
you're trying to actually figure out

00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:21,560
park or if you're trying to figure out

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:26,210
in validation steps funky gs-11

00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:30,380
takes no HP support we'll get to that in

00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:35,120
to slide actually so both you think

00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,360
about Pam picky it's easy to set up it

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,950
comes win with a well-documented the

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,010
example configuration file and it has

00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:47,300
support for Sierra's the bad thing is

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:50,030
that but this is not really late come

00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:53,270
piggy ciesla but Roman is that login is

00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:56,330
not even true so it's not possible to

00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:58,670
tech smart card insertion usually you

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:00,980
must initiate the login process yourself

00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:08,540
so we will either provide the user name

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:12,650
or you will actually have two new

00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:15,620
you or you would enter space and like

00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:21,830
the fabric ecs 11 extract the user name

00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:25,220
of mine from certificate and of course

00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:27,620
something that you will hear a lot as

00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,040
I'm talking about services is no ocsp

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,040
support

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:38,140
next on on to the openvpn you can deploy

00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:40,929
open with me and using X finite sub 50s

00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:44,049
in two variants you can use a soft token

00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:46,960
and for that you just need the open

00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:49,539
between itself and of course you can use

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,539
start and you know it's mark a video a

00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:54,539
spark gap DC AC light it is CSF provider

00:27:54,809 --> 00:28:03,730
when it comes down the configuration of

00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,529
users soft of heart organs in case photo

00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:11,500
can you provide a certificate in

00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:14,799
performance city kid in infants of a in

00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:17,440
chem format file and this file should

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:20,350
include the full trust Iraq you like all

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,630
the road and its media intermediary city

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:26,049
occasionally and you will need to

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:28,419
provide a private POS in tempo if you

00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:30,460
use in the smart card we are providing

00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:33,429
your tongue with which pc is eleven

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,409
provider which library to use and you

00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:38,890
need to provide something that's all

00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:43,240
certificate ECC realized ie I'll get

00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:46,390
this little i'll tell you a little bit

00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,230
about it later and you need to provide

00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,730
the camera parameters in 10 formats

00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,110
generated using openssl that's required

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,110
just for the server

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,550
okay so there are two months of

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:05,380
configurations which you can use for

00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:08,470
open in one is providing trust try

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,840
chained in a single file infant format

00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,410
it shouldn't put both the root and

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,780
intermediate education 30 certificates

00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:20,680
and you can provide optionally this

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:23,580
configuration crl the capture is that

00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:26,590
you must provide only a single serum

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,450
they should target the end entities

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:32,950
which are connecting to the openvpn

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:35,160
server or vice versa the services to

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:38,140
which the opening implants are connected

00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:42,910
of course the problem is that you can't

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:46,390
validate intermediary certificates the

00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:48,250
second variation provides support for

00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:52,000
organized stuff style cache directory

00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:54,130
and you need to specify all the silt

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,680
occasional totes ticketing desire in

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,540
capen download them and hear all the

00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,650
sierras in there and that's actually

00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:06,400
mandatory the good thing when you use

00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:08,290
open BBM that it's one of rare pieces of

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,510
software that actually encourages my

00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:14,880
years of mind certificates one of the

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:19,030
application optimization it's actually

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,270
necessary to explicitly disabled clients

00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,370
fifteens is

00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:26,690
in case for computing so it's not the

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:31,920
top option it supports use of sierra's

00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:35,010
its points use of pkc s11 and in case of

00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:37,710
fire and part for configuration it will

00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:40,080
be low zero every time so you can

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:43,320
download the new cereal in background

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,350
and it will automatically pick it up in

00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,570
case of the second configuration it will

00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:52,830
check all the CFL's it will check both

00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:55,680
the intermediary and identities now the

00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:57,570
problem of quraish money advance of

00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,450
course you can provide a single syrah

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:03,830
but configuration 12 is a bit more

00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:07,500
problematic if you can buy an organist

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:09,180
openssl style cache directory you would

00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:13,050
like to need to restart the internal

00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:15,060
openvpn server to reload reload Sierra's

00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,440
which basically means that you're

00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,310
cutting connections kill all the

00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:24,150
connected ones its use of smart card is

00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:28,250
also bit poorly implemented you can

00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:31,320
civilize certificate ID which is a very

00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,330
ugly Pacific identifier and you must

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,780
provide it and you are unable to

00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:39,600
actually tell if you know use the first

00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:44,190
source which contains a certificate with

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,129
digital signature key usage exam

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:54,750
and of course if he has no horses

00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:57,629
peaceful in case of a map service I've

00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,580
concentrated on the dog but after a

00:31:57,629 --> 00:32:01,470
quick look at the size him up as well

00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,250
but from what I can doubt it doesn't

00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:08,460
really support use of plan certificates

00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:11,220
just for the just the use of positive is

00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,789
for authentication you don't need

00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:17,970
anything else bianca to compile it with

00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:21,149
necessary supporting you will need to

00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:23,360
provide on the server side the price

00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:25,590
events every significant performance

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,940
which should include the root

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,009
certification Authority and

00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,590
intermediaries education Authority

00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:35,429
certificates and you need to provide

00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:39,149
private king temple at the fall and this

00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:41,429
is sketchy parts you need to provide the

00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:43,409
trust chain in performance but the

00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:46,049
formative this file requires that use

00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:48,419
the boat sales and certifications or

00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:50,639
certificates in a single file so you

00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:53,600
should have for example root CA

00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:56,879
certificate followed by the crl

00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:02,490
intermediacy a certificate or by 80 it's

00:32:56,879 --> 00:33:03,870
really not not a good choice now an

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,750
interesting thing about them with these

00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:08,879
steps you can it can determine the

00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:12,539
location of mail directory of that user

00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:14,040
using its user name so for example let's

00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:16,530
say that use the name

00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,560
username at example.com you can actually

00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:23,130
tell it okay use this tactic part / bar

00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:25,140
/ female then use the main then use the

00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:27,810
username this is very useful if you want

00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,990
together multiple domains support among

00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:34,920
the same server and it also eases the

00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:38,790
deployment by you can simply have built

00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,410
all users which is very nice local

00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:44,100
sports extraction fusing from

00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:48,150
certificates but it can use any field

00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:51,930
from a certificate subject will get this

00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:54,570
simulator and it also requires that you

00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:58,260
define a database like username password

00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:00,420
database even though it's sexual

00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,040
superficial so you usually just that if

00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,710
you're using plant certificates

00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,470
exclusively you simply make sure that

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:11,580
it's kind of past true that's every

00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:15,240
possible that the client provides will

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:17,280
actually return our success since we are

00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,230
using all the clients very gay

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,659
verification anyway and we are

00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,690
extracting using

00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:26,389
tificate itself the good thing about the

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:29,349
goods I really like the using

00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:33,619
instruction from my sticky and the

00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:36,409
instant it's all rice and using that is

00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:40,460
that the kind is provided and it has

00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:42,619
support for Cyril verifications the bad

00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,639
thing is that one of the password

00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:48,859
database and feels redundant it's not

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,639
really necessary but you still must

00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:54,909
define something and it's just a little

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,260
bit tedious not not nothin too much and

00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:59,510
you can't use subject of those into

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,089
names for extracting jeezum a so if you

00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:05,059
can put the mail in the certificate

00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:07,819
subject you're in a little bit of

00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:12,559
trouble it can't use for example the

00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:15,799
artsy a tuning from subject alternative

00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,630
name for determining the user name its

00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:20,359
certification authority in serial

00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:23,000
specification is well quite terrible

00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:26,000
that does just asking for trouble when

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,770
you're updating the cl's and it can snow

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,500
ocsp support

00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:36,840
i copy pasted that alot so smtp i want

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,520
to suggest it for six so beyond post

00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:44,430
because you don't need any additional

00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:47,340
software we will need to provide plus

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,930
the certificate in time formats it's

00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,600
kind of standard with routine

00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,730
intermediacy certificates private in

00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,960
performance and that is basically the

00:35:53,730 --> 00:36:00,540
trash chain transgene is specified as a

00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,490
single file and you must play sport

00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,460
truth and it immediately city in the

00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:09,110
Pacific kids increase you also need to

00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:12,210
specify prospects that it should treat

00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:15,030
the client x is rotating authenticate

00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,800
using the client certificate it

00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:21,420
shouldn't allow it to automatically

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,120
really mean to any destination and of

00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,490
course you must make sure to actually

00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:30,090
tell post pics to always require a

00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:33,060
client certificates good thing is that

00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:35,010
it's really a to set up you can

00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,200
once you count the keystore set up and

00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,630
what you have to trust change the pad

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,600
set up it takes like three or four

00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:45,349
comments to keep the entire think on the

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,470
entire thing configured and

00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:52,489
most weeks supports of use of client

00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:55,069
certificates itself for connecting to

00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:57,799
other main transfer agents or even mail

00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:59,989
delivery so it can actually have its own

00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:01,940
client certificates and client and

00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:05,479
private keys which it can use for

00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,400
authenticating sub services bad thing

00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:10,460
and this is the first piece of software

00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:14,259
that doesn't have it no CL support now

00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:17,569
postfix allows use of fingerprint-based

00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:19,729
allowing denialists it's like you take a

00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,979
fingerprint of your certificate and you

00:37:19,729 --> 00:37:24,259
added to list and you can specify that

00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:27,440
leases and allow list or the entire list

00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:28,999
which is really silly I mean you

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,880
basically have all that information

00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:35,089
effectively stonings here okay you don't

00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,569
have the fingerprints but theoretically

00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:41,349
you could set up a script that food

00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:44,299
manually extract fingerprints from some

00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:47,749
promisee database based on serial number

00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:50,560
specified in the crl and of course it

00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:54,460
has no more CSP support

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:58,570
so to conclude this part of presentation

00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:00,370
and the some of my findings what

00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:03,970
findings whether it can be experienced

00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:06,280
we service every city is possible so if

00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,860
you just want to data encryption and the

00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,890
verification of service you are going to

00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:14,740
go it all works well but finds it if

00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:17,860
it's what is not so good there's a lot

00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:20,560
of problems like in cases of reloading

00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:23,020
sierras you usually need in many cases

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,650
you need to start servicing something

00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:29,560
that ocsp response support it's very

00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:34,120
rare when it comes down to server-side

00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:35,860
software I don't think of here that

00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,530
everything's much to work with anything

00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,600
that's also CSP you have some of these

00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:44,770
be responder supporting clients like

00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:48,580
thunder there's a lot of water capped

00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:51,280
moments because you end up like in case

00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:54,310
of dope with vidya specify zeros and see

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,880
if it is in the same file you just skim

00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:59,050
right here but never think God and

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,880
generally client certificate support

00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:04,900
fields like the second grade cities and

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,570
it seems that it doesn't seem it simply

00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,550
is the fact that client support for

00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:12,100
using plastic bins falsification

00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:15,280
authorization was introduced in on all

00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:17,950
this software as a second time so you

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,150
can actually see that in some of the

00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,150
design decisions to make

00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:25,980
some of the necessary improvements that

00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:28,710
we need when it comes up to use of

00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:31,740
design and peace offer would be a more

00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:35,400
uniform configuration like you know

00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,289
support several variants like I want to

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,920
be able to provide certificate restrain

00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:46,440
in single file one cache directory sync

00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:49,319
for a crl and you really really need the

00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,259
cap separation Finn's here at CA and CLL

00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:54,690
pies but in my view those two

00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:58,759
directories if they contain CA in Syria

00:39:54,690 --> 00:40:01,890
should be separated this is in case of

00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:04,140
this is mostly based on my experiences

00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:06,869
of it and open with the end and we

00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:09,960
actually they might be able to do to

00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:12,750
defy some kind of simple open standards

00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,450
which would spell okay if you're this

00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,420
software must be once to support the

00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,440
standard it has to provide these

00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,960
configuration options for this

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:27,240
application that for four years of Exile

00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:29,400
I certificates and we really need

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,039
support forces be responders I mean

00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:36,150
we're dependent completely on CR else

00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:39,079
and when you are trying to deploy use of

00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:42,010
physical warrants in like if you have

00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:45,940
20,000 certificates or even more

00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:49,030
in fishing identity cards in governments

00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:51,670
you will very soon end up having a lot

00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:58,930
of performances because he rose to grow

00:40:51,670 --> 00:41:01,120
a lot we also need it would be nice to

00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,400
have a more particular bill to it when

00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,700
it comes down holiday shin what I liked

00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,530
was we can't be pcs one got it in

00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,830
connected and I think they got to drive

00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:15,070
and you need better error logging I

00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:17,260
can't get a smile about it but I have

00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:19,780
been also setting up cameras using smart

00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:24,460
cards from the initial communication for

00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:26,830
the pre authentication days and let's

00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:32,830
say that if you have some kind of

00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:34,180
problem like you can specify the trash

00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:37,720
things properly or something like that

00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:40,150
you will get very little use for error

00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,370
messages from Gerber's you can actually

00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:45,480
get some more messages by compiling the

00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:52,490
package by hand and the by enabling

00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:57,860
debug supports many and what

00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:59,619
while the highlights i think i think

00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:05,810
that the picture will speak for itself

00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:08,450
the openness of documentation as i was

00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:11,150
working the dog cuts and of course they

00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:13,640
didn't put the email into the subject so

00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:15,619
certificate i put it in subject

00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,220
alternative name I was trying to

00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:21,230
actually implement the simple patch but

00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:24,730
with the art support for extracting

00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:29,960
using some subject concerning to me and

00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:33,410
wow ok I went to Google first like you

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:36,410
know Rio openssl reads subjective

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:39,590
alternative name from certificate and of

00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:42,890
course nothing comes up then I try to

00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:47,330
import Orioles for openssl I think the

00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:50,480
newest tutorial is from 2005 for from my

00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:57,619
games website amongst the first hit on

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:59,810
google + ok so then I started digging

00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:02,240
through the code first I tried to look

00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:04,010
good what functions don't get is using

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,640
for extracting here do you use names

00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:09,740
from a subject I found you some of the

00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,890
openssl functions and they were not

00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:15,290
documented it seems that those tutorials

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:18,910
which deal with openssl actually only

00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:23,540
concentrate on the part where to perform

00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:25,430
several clients SL TLS handshake and

00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,070
kind of it's nobody goes into details

00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:31,070
how to work with certificates extract

00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:32,720
extract information from civic from

00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:39,590
certificates and use it in some

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:43,280
meaningful way that puts basically the

00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:47,390
presentation so if anyone has some kind

00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,190
of question yes but the openssl they

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:52,760
just said I gave you the documentation

00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:54,820
really bad but I find that looking at

00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,590
the apps directly and the democratic way

00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,390
there's lots of simple examples that you

00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,880
can follow but yes that's what

00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:04,910
documentation yes so much it once I

00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:09,140
learn what I can to do but the problem

00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:12,110
is open SSL is I don't have that it is a

00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:14,450
good grip the library the problem is

00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,010
that it's used by everyone and you would

00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,770
expect that you actually have more

00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:21,580
documentation explain some features okay

00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:24,380
given the openssl website says like

00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:28,640
documentation is incomplete or something

00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:31,280
like that but i think if we are if

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:36,800
everyone is using it we really need to

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:41,920
know a little bit smaller molecules any

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,920
other questions gentleman from

00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:50,950
up there I mean maybe we should have a

00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:53,559
weekly lesson yeah oh I put some

00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:58,299
everyone will conquer you yeah I'll put

00:44:53,559 --> 00:45:01,720
some stuff on okay so i actually have

00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:04,270
undone second here but i'll see if i can

00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:08,349
manage to get it working in the next

00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:11,440
5-10 minutes ok but any other questions

00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:15,039
so that have you tried achieve support /

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:18,039
apache web sample i I didn't get to that

00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:20,260
point yet because I think so seize the

00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:25,180
CSP support at least there wasn't much

00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:27,369
oh it says that's why not using

00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,410
something like Ashton in a take a UNIX

00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:30,819
way that you use one thing for one

00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:32,829
purpose it does you know all the

00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:39,640
server's interests shall i shall

00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:42,190
injustice you can't if you can start TLS

00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:45,190
spanning initiative little station like

00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:48,369
in case smtp Cory Mac when you connect

00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:51,770
server plain text and then tell its to

00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:55,050
initiate the cachet you can't

00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:57,540
you and you totally as a celebration you

00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:03,420
have the either again it can get a bit

00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:09,540
tedious if you if you need to you can

00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:12,000
use if for example if we do using a

00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:15,690
stunna you actually need to tell your

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:20,360
application to connect to local host so

00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:23,550
you use that you lose a little bit of

00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:26,190
configuration readability because you

00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:28,650
you don't know you don't see it at

00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:30,750
applications configuration picture a

00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:34,170
travertine deck episode yes tunnel

00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:36,810
fiesta and of course with the USS

00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:38,880
Nautilus slowly user authorization for

00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:40,830
tracks with you for example primer you

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,560
will need both a client certificate

00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:46,200
amusement cause which you will get two

00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:49,530
certificate I think I don't know about

00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:51,090
this I mean you can you get making the

00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,580
certificate of education in an

00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:56,970
environment variable and then just far

00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:59,550
as the certificate for you know give we

00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:03,830
assured environment variables with a

00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:08,760
nice Theory so

00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:11,850
any other questions so can you use

00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,310
almost everything that you want to use

00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:19,800
that were everyday life using for court

00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:23,730
stuff I wouldn't there there's a lot of

00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,710
things that work but I its kind of most

00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:28,500
most things are implemented most things

00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:30,630
are there it's just we need some small

00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:35,280
steps to actually make the game more

00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:43,200
user-friendly and to make it more easier

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:48,510
to configure ok so

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:51,750
a little bit of thanks so thanks thanks

00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:53,520
