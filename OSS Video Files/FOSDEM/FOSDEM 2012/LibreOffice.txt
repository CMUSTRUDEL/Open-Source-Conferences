uh yeah online in your pocket look at

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,280
that allowing the UI track isn't that

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,420
that's quaint um so let's think about

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,240
the future you know we're all

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,549
enlightened clever people we can't we

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,980
can predict the future can we so in the

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,500
future you know cloud computing you know

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,630
as everyone knows will be the only

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,100
choice you know boy I love those choices

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,949
where there's only you know there's

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,710
anyway no choice successful businesses

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,720
even main soon have no chief executive I

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,489
think my chief executives been told this

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,930
I'm know headquarters and no IT

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,930
infrastructure the fact they won't exist

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,640
at all um no I don't um so that this is

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,410
pretty cool right that's the future um

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,680
right so or app stores the future of

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,899
desktop applications right 300,000

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,239
iphone or ipad apps 10 billion downloads

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,210
10 billion that's a big number even I

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,550
know that Apple has taken concept the

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,020
desktops amazing isn't it in the future

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:01,350
there aren't gonna be any apps oh right

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:05,489
yeah so what's going to win I don't know

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:11,520
who can say um mix and match oh well

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:12,930
yeah so yeah SAS so it solves the

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,369
deployment problems nicely you know you

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,630
don't want to install this massive piece

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,890
of software and your your business

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,799
because software is impossible to

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,030
install with its its massive and you

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,350
know some of these these web apps you

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,299
know add cool collaborative features

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,729
enabled by the the network that they

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,610
have to use so so that's cool but they

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,600
often take these major regressions you

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,750
know what you see is what you get

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,479
editing gone you know we managed to get

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,680
out of the text word microsoft word five

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,869
and then if you remember that you know

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,729
the text you can do anything on the

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,860
console we got WYSIWYG editing it wasn't

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:48,060
it brilliant for 20 years and now it's

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,470
going again offline access the little

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,570
things like yeah when you're on your

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,979
massive yacht in the middle of the ocean

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,040
you know being able to get to your

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,450
documents so on the other side you know

00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,549
these app stores are just wildly popular

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,619
everyone's doing you know this Apple's

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,110
Intel as a Microsoft you know everyone

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,850
is is is app storing five million

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,890
downloads a day that's pretty good

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,849
Firefox is about a million as I

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,129
understand it so that they're doing

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,420
pretty well and you know we should we

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,530
should really like event some way to

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,700
install software

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,069
linux you know where you could I have

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,220
granular packages and suck things from

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,209
online repository so be awesome right

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,970
Skinner it's gonna be the breakthrough

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,620
technology now um so the other approach

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,540
you know there's these two poles is to

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,610
like mesh it together so not only do you

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,560
have a web app but you've installed it

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,940
from a web app store you know that's the

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,950
best of all buzzwords isn't it you know

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,319
you can you can cross them all off web

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,940
app stores you know I'm just installing

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,540
my web app and you know I don't know

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,069
anyhow so this is the world we live in

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,360
and everyone is really at the end of the

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,590
day searching for the Magic Bullet how

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,980
can we do something for nothing you know

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,590
how can we in leverage are synergistic

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,480
something or others and there's lots of

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,070
magic bullets out there here so I'd like

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,769
to sell you you can just get this

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,050
massive 10 full productivity improvement

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,550
by using any one of these languages you

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,519
know it's just a mystery to me why no

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,780
one uses the latest trendy language but

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,519
particularly if you have a large code

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,739
base you can pick a trendy language

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,290
every few years and your code base will

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,130
never move so you end up with in a sec

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,870
plus plus Python Perl java javascript

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,040
javascript engines written in java and

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,470
then you have LibreOffice it's wonderful

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,450
isn't it you know fashion and and the

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,640
great thing is it's so simple these new

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,380
languages are amazing um you know anyway

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,110
there you go if you believe that you'll

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,579
believe anything so actually it seems to

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,920
me the only real magic bullet here is

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,120
code reuse not writing new code the

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,829
inner the best line of code is one you

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,239
didn't have the right and you didn't

00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,700
write you just reused in a free software

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,900
is brilliant at this free software we

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,390
can look in the box and you can actually

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,459
get in there and you can reuse code that

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,769
you can see it's just fantastic I spent

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,660
some part of my early youth as a

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,329
professional engineer I'm writing

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,980
component software and components offer

00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:58,440
is this brilliant idea that by writing

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,630
these contracts and interfaces and ideal

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,880
descriptions and heavily documenting

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,609
them that you can produce reusable

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,769
software blobs and I'm just totally

00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,870
disillusioned by it it's all rubbish so

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,130
there you go don't bother and the

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,359
proprietary well of course has to suffer

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,739
with this because you know you can't

00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,810
look inside the black box it's nailed

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,070
shut because you pay for that and if you

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,329
looked inside you discover it was all

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,609
duct tape and baling twine and you

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,320
wouldn't pay so you know you can't even

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:24,120
hand the code out so actually we get a

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,039
lot of this right in free software we

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,360
really do well but the problem is you

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,129
know rewriting is such fun

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,900
you know there are these new languages

00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:34,889
to learn an endless supply of them

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,439
supply you know go dart oh no they just

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,300
come constantly you know and some yeah

00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,409
and collaboration is hard you know

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,629
working with other people why bother

00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:45,300
doing that why we use stuff it's all old

00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:46,650
and boring well so i'm interested in

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,689
office suite because I think office

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,969
suites are cool and as you can see by

00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:53,699
the packed room obviously lots of other

00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:56,729
people agree so here's a quick history

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,080
of a failed office suite rewrites which

00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,419
i think is perhaps perhaps interesting

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,560
you've obviously heard of micropro there

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:06,210
the u.s. is largest software company

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,800
yeah they were anyway in the 80s they

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,539
were the biggest company ever they were

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,189
the number-one office suite word star

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:15,930
brilliant and then they decided to

00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:17,279
duplicate their office suite to compete

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,900
with IBM's display right so they didn't

00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,069
actually kill the product because you're

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,689
still going to sell something right to

00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,550
pay all these people and be number one

00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:25,770
so they created another one it was an

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,620
exact functional duplicate with a slight

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,240
changes right and this totally killed

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,039
the company they fought there was

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,080
internal warfare who should market which

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,449
which one goes the traders would start

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,659
2,000 versus WordStar this is way before

00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:41,310
2000 and some yeah they just killed it

00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:43,740
will start 2,000 never delivered it

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,690
never had the feature set and it created

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,960
a poisonous acrimony in the company that

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,520
killed it um Corel office now there's

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,990
another leading product in the office

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,180
suite market absolutely fantastic and

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,979
they rewrote in Java because there's

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,750
everyone knows all software will soon be

00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,279
run on a java virtual machine it's funny

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,889
isn't it how the old failures of

00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,330
yesterday come in as the new new shiny

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:06,270
technologies of today on your mobile

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,029
phone but anyway maybe we can actually

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,830
make this vision happen these days but

00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:12,330
this beautiful technology demonstration

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,520
late they trashed their working product

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,740
and they re put all their engineers on

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,569
on writing Java technology demos which

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,819
were brilliant in 97 you know the zenith

00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:23,580
of run the beater in your browser it's

00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,500
not useful I never shipped a final

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,000
version squandered their cash destroyed

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,439
their market position so that's fine

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,719
Microsoft tried the same thing

00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,240
interestingly they they try to rewrite

00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:35,699
words and they call it pyramid actually

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,469
tried several times and pyramids be an

00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,330
attempt to completely rewrite it's just

00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,770
completely broken we need to completely

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,810
rewrite the thing

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,979
and yeah it was abandoned when they

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,919
discovered they could just never catch

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,360
up with themselves so you are much

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,970
better to do incremental stepwise

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,009
refactoring so they're not terribly

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,870
terribly new idea i would suggest but

00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:58,409
it's one that's perhaps worth relearning

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,300
so I think we have a different approach

00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,099
when I when I hear this model of you

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,240
know we really need to rewrite the eight

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:08,039
million line office suite in JavaScript

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,060
you know I you know I love that kind of

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,819
argument obviously it's a full

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,370
employment you know methodology and if

00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,740
we had a Soviet state we could employ

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,800
hundreds of thousands of intelligent

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,509
people doing useless work rewriting it

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,090
in type unsafe JavaScript and trying to

00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,530
debug it um but if you disagree that's

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,780
fine go and do it somewhere somewhere

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,599
else but just not in LibreOffice and

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,759
interestingly often you you then have to

00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,169
be online yourself currently most of

00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,849
these suites in fact if not all of them

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:38,370
you have to be online while you're doing

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:39,180
it as well and even the telcos don't

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,699
believe you're going to be online all

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,500
the time if a telco actually believed

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,349
you would be online and that their

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,330
connectivity was any good everywhere and

00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:51,270
they pull this apps that are running in

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,250
this massive dual core java GL processor

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,919
thing somewhere else you know like in

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,139
the cheap scalable cloud meta

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,430
infrastructure right but they don't

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,779
where is your address book well of

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,889
course it's on your device right because

00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,810
otherwise you have to lean out the

00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,699
window like this to get a signal so you

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,440
can call on the landline when it's not

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,509
working right you know and there's too

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,240
many people died doing that so they put

00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,409
it on the device right um and and simply

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,699
they put you know just increasing

00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,319
amounts on this thing this device starts

00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,599
to look like a laptop in your in your

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,719
pocket no and then they turn it into a

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,250
laptop but hey and yeah you have this

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:24,900
huge flash player running and if you can

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,940
run the flash player on your phone you

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,800
know that it must have some serious

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,599
horsepower in it and that you know your

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,570
your GPU has more transistors than you

00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,010
do and all of that sort of thing so yeah

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,050
none of it's in the cloud funny isn't it

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,849
so here's how we're doing it in libreoff

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,490
it so we're basically reusing as much as

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,950
possible a ninety-five percent of the

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,180
code is shared across across these

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,310
things so there's even a laser pointer

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:51,870
thing here somewhere I try not kill

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:53,610
someone in the crowd wait a minute what

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,690
did that do oh that's the kill your

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,810
laptop button

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,010
letters oh well um but either way if you

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,640
remember the picture that was on the

00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:05,610
screen before I i press the kill button

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,260
then you'll is that oh you came back

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,330
perfect now which is the laser one tell

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,270
me oh the middle write rate stairway

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,280
perfect so um so the web office here of

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,090
course you know shares everything so

00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,640
that's one of one of the interesting

00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,590
things about this box is that most web

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,180
office suites that you look at you

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,680
immediately cut features out like that's

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,970
it you know well by the way you can't do

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,200
easy wig and you can't do this and you

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,370
can't do that you can't do redlining you

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,110
can't do change tracking you can't do

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,330
you know powerful tables and you can't a

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,890
nested this and you can't do that right

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,390
it's a web office suite right that's

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,100
what you did but look at this one it's

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,750
got everything it is the most powerful

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,950
suite in fact if you look at Libre

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,180
Office as we install it we don't even

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,640
have the help embedded you know you have

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,350
to go online to get the help in 108

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,870
languages or whatever we support because

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,250
it's that big and it's that infrequently

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,250
used that it's not worth having on your

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,540
device so that's interestingly different

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,740
about this approach and of course your

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,330
the traditional model that has a bit of

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,130
clip art and templates but maybe not all

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,220
of it and then we you know cut it right

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:02,070
down for a small viewing or minimal

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,630
editing device on the handset so it's a

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,010
crazy plan well is it possible how can

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,290
you have the same thing running or like

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,180
your this tiny device and also this in a

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,190
great big pc it's just impossible right

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,570
well yeah nice except the colonel you

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,130
know is running on the phone and things

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,650
that are smaller and we'll see all your

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,480
super computers right so in theory this

00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,030
is possible whether practically it is

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,900
who knows and of course cheering code

00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,790
base you know when you fix your

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,260
rendering bug it's fixed everywhere

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,870
which is nice when you add your new UI

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,580
feature it's they're everywhere are you

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,540
interrupt ability fixes on and while

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,740
there they happen everyone your

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,130
performance wins you know you speed up

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,260
one you speed up the rest and there are

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,670
other joy is really I mean yeah you can

00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,110
of course builds and debug your thing on

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,089
the really fast hardware and before you

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,100
run it on the the really lame harmonious

00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:45,540
any people who claim that writing

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,760
millions of lines of JavaScript and

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,730
running it in your phone having cheated

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,950
a type unsafe language where you can add

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,710
members to struct after you've jittered

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,089
it you know I mean this is anyway it's

00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,080
going to perform really wonderfully you

00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,240
know this is going to be much better

00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,520
than native code I think are in lala

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,170
land with a vengeance so they were if

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,590
you say them see them shake their hand

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,390
they need help um

00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,830
so interoperability okay you fix

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,060
everything you I improvements so the

00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,740
other thing is that these devices are

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,760
becoming remarkably similar so on the

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,990
left-hand side you see I've stolen

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,880
Intel's beautiful a pop art work and

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:22,070
ultrabook I like look at this slim you

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,890
know it's slim right and on the other

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,470
side we have an android thing and they

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,000
look so different right don't they you

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,060
know like there's a keyboard there's a

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,760
touchscreen you know it's just a totally

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,810
different device segment the tablet

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,250
anyway so there's a degree of

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,020
convergence we have to do a whole of

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,850
this work anyway to get touch enabled

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:45,500
and make the office suite work well with

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:47,200
with touch so performance yeah yeah

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,280
there's all these beautiful beautiful

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,180
limitations you come across androids

00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,370
linker is particularly special yeah only

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,170
food yeah so you can only link 96 shared

00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,570
libraries into your application we have

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,610
a shared library problem from you know

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,290
meta component izing everything in the

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,990
past and so we're trying to D matter

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,200
component eyes and this is one of the

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,370
things that will help drive that I hope

00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,510
just a side effect of doing that work

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,400
though actually google Summer code

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,930
funded a chunk of this anak Chapel

00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,850
Matyszczyk you can that means that will

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,380
be lumping more into one library so we

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,810
can link time optimize it and make it

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,640
faster for everyone so the work we do on

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,290
that Android device actually will help

00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,630
everyone get a faster smaller more

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,070
efficiently bravas you start to notice

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,110
things like the unit is fifteen percent

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,210
of your CPU start up as pausing config

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,930
and the first look twenty percent of the

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:38,240
config is pausing label descriptions or

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:40,070
paige thinks no one ever well someone

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,510
uses it clearly otherwise we wouldn't

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,580
have the feature but it's a really a

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,110
point one percent minority use k so

00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,200
we're doing it every startup for

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,520
everyone why and the smaller we can do

00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,110
in terms of accelerating our page

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,040
rendering and panning so that we do less

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,990
less rendering slow um yeah LibreOffice

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,270
online perfect let me see how the time

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,740
is going I can slow down perfectly so

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,800
we're rendering using a webcam vez its

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,770
html5 compliant compatible which is good

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,110
right only html5 communicating we use

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,850
web sockets and I just finished getting

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,440
the WebSocket v7 version working

00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,690
recently so it actually works in modern

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,880
browsers as well as ancient ones

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,070
and we have this just very simple plain

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,870
text protocol and we shall compress

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:27,260
pings across for updating the screens

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,370
and yeah we can see what's rear enders

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,340
too tight I'll show you a demo in a

00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,050
second but as we type although we will

00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,270
see quite a big box being rear-ended

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,280
around what we're doing actually we're

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,990
only sending this little guy that we

00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,790
actually changed and we're only sending

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,520
a compressed version of that so it does

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,770
a delta as you go and as you scroll it's

00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,580
doing copy areas as well so it's

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:52,310
relatively efficient um we use that gtk3

00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,640
is Broadway back-end to do that um and

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:58,160
so yeah all of the intelligence all of

00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,710
the work is on the server and the client

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,000
is being a dumb client that's not the

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,290
best use of transistors you've got lots

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,170
of transistors doing nothing in your

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,870
client but then you don't have to write

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,980
a lot of JavaScript so that's good and

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,450
it's still a prototype yeah I can't

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,630
emphasize this enough hopefully we'll

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,890
show you some good bugs later and yeah

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,750
it gives you as I say this full feature

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,120
experience WYSIWYG editing edit your

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,340
footnotes you know pivot tables macros

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,780
and there's some API challenges there

00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,640
that we're just not addressed so let me

00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:29,660
let me see if I can make the demo work

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,460
so da hah here we are so this is a libra

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,810
office in the browser and i don't know

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,700
if you ever used libre office you know

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,200
hello well the sort of thing so there

00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,900
been some nice new UI changes recently

00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,010
so this this beautiful thing here so you

00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,650
can create headers don't know if you can

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,150
see the you know this is a header well

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,770
they most people really want just the

00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:49,340
field numbers in there so you know you

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:51,740
can put a field and put a page number

00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,590
aha so if you've ever wondered how to

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,580
get a page number in in LibreOffice you

00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,380
know this is this is pretty much it

00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,390
that's how you do it beautiful huh I'm

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,800
so that usability improvement of the

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,050
click Add what you see is what you get

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,839
stuff is of course immediately applied

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,130
to the web app as well at Sur UNIX

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,800
entirely shared code which is kind of

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,540
nice so what else can we do um yeah the

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,530
screen is kind of small maybe I should

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:18,080
have resized that window then a zoo a

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,339
puzzle OC forget anything no hmm it's

00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,960
important to practice your demos in

00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:26,380
advance otherwise you know people will

00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:28,690
think you're um silly very silly Oh

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,310
perfect so do we have here

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,080
this is a picture of my wife this is

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,940
clear proof that you know working on

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,260
LibreOffice increases your chances in

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,120
the marriage market look at that isn't

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,560
it beautiful in case you needed that

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,470
obviously I would say it's kind of

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,640
obvious but there you go so what can we

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,770
do here you know this is all this

00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,420
beautiful text wrapping staff you know

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,330
here so I only if we can move this guy

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,510
over here and we can crikey and it's

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,920
moved off the top now I don't know yeah

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,080
it's not as usable as all that is there

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,640
let's face it so I think some of these

00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,200
window metaphors really need a bit of

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,240
love but are we can we can move this

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,700
chap around in theory and then we could

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,250
press the apply button mmm and we could

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,690
get rid of that in which case I'm gonna

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,770
I'm gonna bandhan ship on this one

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,410
because that doesn't look like it's

00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:15,070
gonna gonna happen very well Oprah freak

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:17,680
it's gone away no no it's back again now

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,450
but I can move this chap around when i

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,260
apply him let's draw a little bit over

00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:28,480
here hmm hopefully that'll stick out and

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:30,610
cause grief for the other stuff oh yeah

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,740
so you can see this is a real demo right

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,390
you know the snow there's no hacks here

00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,290
you know let me restart this because

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,090
then you can see all the printout

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:40,930
scrolling like that which I find it

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:45,640
reassuring well this thing is he oh no

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:48,040
no what how fascinating hmm tell you

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,680
what I will not show you my macro demo

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,440
just now because it looks like this is

00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,690
not having a good day which is a shame

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,650
but hey you nearly saw this and then you

00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:01,990
nearly saw the macros running right hmm

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:06,010
okay claps applause hey thank you i try

00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:07,540
it you know i tried him so i was up

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,040
until very late the night before last

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,870
working on the android port which is

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,689
even more flaky but will she will see

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:15,040
that in a minute but the nice thing is

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:16,630
of course you can run your vba macro so

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,870
you know if you have your enterprise

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:23,410
that really doesn't use much staff and

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:24,400
we talk to businesses that some you know

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,720
they don't really want to install an

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,610
office suite on lots of machines because

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,190
they actually only use a few documents I

00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,960
mean a few random timesheet filling

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,360
tight applications and this a pain in

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,890
the backside to have to deploy this

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,990
thing and manage it something quite like

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,700
that a central asian thing so then

00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,200
there's the ecom possibly scale argument

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,190
i'm really annoyed about that I should

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,080
really

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,370
let me let me just fiddle around with it

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,620
again you know maybe we can get some

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,260
something funny to happen instead right

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,970
now I'm not going to kill all of those

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,180
did I actually get rid of it yes I did

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:57,100
uh-huh maybe this I'm going to blame the

00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,790
browser so why would that be there I

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,580
mean you don't open it well anyway um so

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,140
maybe if I can type some things mm-hmm

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,800
so I can turn on the rear ndering

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:10,720
support so you can see as I type it is

00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,360
really round ring stuff like this okay

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,740
which is kind of nice of course it don't

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,300
you rent us the bit that are I'm

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,130
actually carrying about which is which

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,630
is kind of good also you can see that

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,570
let me see if I can get the VBA demo to

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,920
work us that's actually quite fun and

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:26,830
it's branded it's very important to be

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,120
fully branded you know oh here we go so

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,010
there's a little button here and you

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,990
know you've got this this is a vba macro

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,030
and you know you can you can run it and

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,100
you can play those you know the

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,350
productivity enhancing games that are

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,530
you know so key to our modern enterprise

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:45,820
system and ah I should get something and

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:47,740
leave that do you think I am so you know

00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,420
while the Android virtual machine is

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,030
building itself you can do that you know

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,920
it takes a little while Danny how so

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,630
whether we can possibly scale I'm so

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,300
LibreOffice you know in a multi-user

00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,280
well we already do this for remote X so

00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,350
I know so here are the the names

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,790
carefully scrubbed out of the people

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,040
that happen to be typing at that minute

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:08,410
but there's you know this is 73 live

00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,630
users and 10 people in writer and 10 in

00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,430
calc and this is on it's a pretty beefy

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,470
hardware and this is what the users

00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,320
admin guess is he'll get out of that um

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:19,090
if rented servers truly are cheaper if

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,840
they truly are cheaper than you know

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:24,850
lots of cheap laptops then why doesn't

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,220
it you know makes sense so that's the

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,810
thought so show me the Kate well it's

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,820
all there it ships out of the box people

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,990
put nasty things on Twitter saying

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,310
where's the khaid because they haven't

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,380
looked in master and discovered it's all

00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,600
in the main branch and so here it is it

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,280
ships out of the box and it even works

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,230
on a reasonable the modern operating

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,200
system you need some updates to 12 suits

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,570
with 12 want to do it and that's it

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,510
hacking help is needed but the basic way

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,390
it works is that our vcl rendering our

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:55,150
class libraries used to render using X

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,110
directly so although you've got the gtk

00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,880
theming of things

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,309
all of the lines and pixels on the

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,190
screen were hammered on one by one using

00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:05,650
the old ex API you know allocated color

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,000
you know I want to allocate black I got

00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,830
some black excellent draw on the screen

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,120
with it in all of those beautiful crisp

00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:14,650
modern api's and so to port to this we

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,750
had to throw all that away and do some

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,299
more heavy-duty lifting for client-side

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:22,840
rendering but that's that's working

00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,760
reasonably well and yeah and you don't

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:30,880
even need the browser to find the gtk3

00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:31,929
bugs but why would you need to why would

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,820
you need to do this I mean you could

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:35,980
just use VNC right or you could use the

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,780
Java VNC or the VNC JavaScript version

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,880
or whatever in your in your browser and

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,020
that's a good question i think we

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,520
clearly want to be moving to a place

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,190
where you you have a service that

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,110
renders pages and that you can do a lot

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,419
more from javascript with them in theory

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,650
we have this beautiful programming model

00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,929
so that you know you can do you know

00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,179
components magic on everything and and

00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:56,500
create an automate your document and

00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:57,730
there's really no reason why that can't

00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,340
be done from the client side in the

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,770
browser talking to the remote remote

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,870
server to script it and create forms and

00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,750
fields and layouts and embed them in

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:12,669
pages and do things in pretty sexy ways

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:16,150
so I feel that be good so yes so Android

00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:17,950
yes I think the fakes thing is a copy

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,809
and paste from previous thing so ignore

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,280
that so I'm a fraud I would just point

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:23,400
out that all the heavy lifting here was

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,830
done by the man with a beer not a bit

00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,390
she has a bit as well so um to Luke list

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,770
is just a genius he he ported you too

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,730
Kate windows and maintain there for many

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:35,140
years but yeah and this really came out

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,250
of our cross compiling work so doing a

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,350
whole lot of work to cross-compile

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,660
Lieber office for Windows primarily a

00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:43,299
winners is just a disaster of a platform

00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,970
to build for you know getting repeatable

00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:47,650
builds where repeatable means you know

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,059
you start from the bare metal and you

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,400
get to build that's exactly the same

00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,470
it's really really not pleasant and so

00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,230
large amounts of Windows software you by

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,210
some idiot has clicked buttons in a user

00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,490
interface you know click click click

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,870
click click drag and drop from the

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,450
release build somewhere else you know

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,030
this level of quality and we don't like

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,710
that we want to click a button and

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,789
minutes later to have an entire clean

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,700
rebuilds of Libra

00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:14,559
and so a large amount of works being

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,909
done here in part by tour part by candy

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,690
who's singing the front here to

00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:22,119
cross-compile two windows also because

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,639
it takes about 45 30 minutes 25 minutes

00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:26,950
on one of these 64 CPU monsters that we

00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:28,330
have in the labs to compile from clean

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:31,090
the whole thing whereas on Windows

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:34,600
you're talking six to eight hours so

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,249
quite a quite a serious difference so

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,929
that's pretty good so just out of the

00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:40,690
cross compiling work falls the fact that

00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:45,190
you can cross compile to arm from Mac or

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:47,019
two Mac from arm or yeah well all you

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,359
said of weird combinations it's truly

00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:51,609
useful for Android and fri offs and so

00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,019
on and there's really a lot of

00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:54,220
interesting new things to do if you want

00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:57,159
to play with Android and really get some

00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,960
experience of it and I do do just get

00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,149
stuck in it have this branch here

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,759
feature Android it's not much in it in

00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:05,679
terms of patches but um it's pretty cool

00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,299
we're getting somewhere and I was gonna

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,830
yeah well it'll be some kind of live

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,440
demo it's not gonna be very good let me

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,840
let me try and the orange juice stuff is

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,340
just a artifact of I wanted to get

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,279
something on the screen so i wrote ously

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,450
loop the dumped junk in it and we

00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,859
managed to get the fonts working so look

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,659
at this this is this is before this is

00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:26,379
improvement look from there no fonts to

00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:27,639
here with fonts oh no and let's see if

00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:29,109
the emulator is actually going to wake

00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:31,720
up you must bear in mind that this is a

00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:33,820
an emulated arm device we did look at

00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,399
that and I press tab and if I'm lucky

00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,820
well I get a menu I've got a mini before

00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:41,529
oh and it crashed awesome awesome so you

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,379
lay my demo look at that you know hey

00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:45,669
and you get all sorts of debug down here

00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:47,739
as well look at that I might try running

00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:49,299
it again let me see I'll point out the

00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:52,599
candy was finding my ridiculous

00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:53,799
programming errors last night there so

00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,570
one of the nice things about Android is

00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,340
you can't attach the debugger to start

00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,720
with you can't run the app in the

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,159
debugger you have to run the app but

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,960
then attach the debugger but if the apps

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,210
crashed before you attach the debugger

00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,399
you don't can't debug anything right so

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,649
there's all of this let's add a really

00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:10,749
big sleep right at the beginning which

00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:13,149
seems like a good idea except you can

00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:15,039
can't see debug symbols for apps that

00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:17,710
load off libraries that load after you

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:21,129
attach to the debugger it's a bit of a

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:23,200
pain but everyone's using it so we have

00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,740
to we have to make it work so I'm going

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,270
to say that

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,510
for now that's not working but we can

00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:30,220
get writer and it looks pretty cool of

00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,809
course it looks totally lame for an

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,150
Android app right you don't want to be

00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:36,160
typing into this guy unless you happen

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,840
to have on those keyboard ones that

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,420
looks just like a normal laptop right

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,840
because it's not too terribly bad in

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,429
that circumstance and um yeah so there's

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,960
a whole load of the the same work that

00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:49,059
we need in the web world to get pages

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,679
rendering into textures and flipping

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:52,690
around and zoom pinch to zoom and so on

00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,440
and putting little little you I shells

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:59,440
around this to make it actually work so

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,640
that is that and that's not the end

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,720
point yeah you'll be pleased to know

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,270
that um so we need this Java a native

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,740
rapper to make this work well and I

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,740
think we're targeting this you know high

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,090
fidelity viewer first so that we can ya

00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,250
see documents there's nothing really

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,380
they will render your nice weird a

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,300
Microsoft documents with these funny

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,880
features inside and the SmartArt and the

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,460
odd custom shapes and so on as well as

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,179
doing your ODF and doing your well even

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,590
more exotic corel we add a file formats

00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:32,230
and so on so hopefully we can provide

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,630
something useful there and the same path

00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:37,960
shrink it make it smaller and faster and

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,490
more efficient for everyone so maybe our

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,900
there's lots of scope there and there

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,150
are lots of other mobile targets as well

00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,760
I'm Android just happens to be easy than

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:48,130
others to develop for so that's pretty

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,130
much the the random you know excursions

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:53,830
into crazy hacked I preferred it to

00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:56,260
about 350 actually but let's see if we

00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:59,559
got some time for that so it's out next

00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,970
week which is good and the key point is

00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,679
that this whole loads of cool volunteers

00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:07,630
been working on this so here's a graph

00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:08,950
of it I like to admit what the scale

00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,530
actually means on the left hand side I

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,880
think that's very helpful for people

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:16,179
this is the number of people committing

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,160
code in a given month so you can see as

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,050
the months go on we lost Oracle I guess

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,210
that's the big red thing here but that

00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:25,450
was kind of inevitable so we're doing

00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,950
well growing and producing lots of nice

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,510
features so one of the things are the

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,120
Germans here do we have any Germans of

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,400
Krypton I said I speak German vaguely ah

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,260
good perfect people back good more MORE

00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,049
it's fine to be German on Stevie's these

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,480
people have a special mission

00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:41,789
in in in LibreOffice because we have

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,919
lots of German comments and I heard this

00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:46,200
pit in a plaintiff plea earlier from our

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,909
writer maintainer who has to wade

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,249
through all of this layout code which is

00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:51,960
not particularly beautiful please please

00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:54,659
come and translate the comments in the

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,830
layout codon writer anyhow we're making

00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:57,239
some good progress here we wanted to

00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,860
translate twenty thousand lines of

00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:00,989
German comment as found by the tool in

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,779
the last two two releases or these

00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:05,549
wonderful people and we only have thirty

00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:07,259
two thousand to go so the job is nearly

00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:08,820
done you know if you don't join now you

00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,039
know it could be your chance for glory

00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,960
could be finished um so yeah if you

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,129
speak German please help other things

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,769
were doing is removing code that's never

00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:18,299
actually run and so we have a brilliant

00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:20,519
tool written by quail on that can

00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:22,739
definitively prove that this cody is

00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,299
never actually run it's not linked it's

00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:26,399
not even as they point us to it anyway

00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:27,869
so we're doing pretty well we had 5,000

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,279
plus methods we knew weren't ever

00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:31,440
executed and we managed to get this down

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,759
to it you know sixteen sixteen fifty so

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,960
this task is coming to an end but

00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,749
there's still some fun to be had there

00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,249
too so here are some other features that

00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:40,379
the being put in this guy is actually a

00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:42,239
hero he he's written so we never had a

00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:44,429
grammar checker for a long time it turns

00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:47,580
out that some just before novell BOTS

00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:50,639
zinian they sold the grammar checker

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,320
that nivelle had to microsoft so

00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:54,179
microsoft's grammar checker is actually

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,649
sort of novel technology that we could

00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:58,679
have open sourced had we not foolishly

00:27:55,649 --> 00:28:00,869
sold it just before but anyway apart

00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,600
from these kind of historical sadnesses

00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:04,859
um we have now this python grammar

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,289
checker that's pretty cool well that's

00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:09,350
all right and we'll sit on some pretty

00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:11,669
nice typography things making

00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,100
LibreOffice much better fit for desktop

00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:17,190
publishing and doing some really pretty

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:19,710
font font work hopefully I'll be

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,600
appreciated by people um what else we

00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,009
have I if you like game theory I don't

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,659
if you like game theory you know we

00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:27,119
should nuke the Russians immediately I

00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,840
think von Neumann was free up for that I

00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,389
don't know that's a very good

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,220
application of game theory but anyway if

00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,989
you like that sort of thing olivia has

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,840
been making your life beautiful and if

00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:41,460
you're from an Asian area you know much

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:43,320
improved RTL stuff which is cool what

00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,879
else Oh improved conditional formatting

00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,679
did I mention all these are volunteers

00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:49,080
who just showed up and came and

00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,850
contributed cool stuff and anyone that's

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,170
ever saved in a Microsoft format using

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,310
openoffice would have been presented

00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:57,000
with a question they can't possibly

00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:59,010
answer and you know would you not like

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,450
to not save it in the other format that

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,980
whatever you know so there's this keep

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,630
current format which you don't know what

00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,250
it is but they you know you chose it and

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:07,440
then save lady so it's all been changed

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,900
like you know use Microsoft Word 2000

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,030
what about use ODF format so hopefully

00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,160
the annoyance factor is slightly reduced

00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:16,680
very easy patch cool guy done by

00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,550
volunteers that came along what about

00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,470
this one there's a thing called

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,870
microsoft visio you can buy a few you

00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,190
know have a small fortune and now we

00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,710
import it and if you watch carefully

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:29,460
we'll switch to the other version right

00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,930
let me do that again let me see I

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,580
personally like it without the grid I

00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,690
think it's an improvement but so there's

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,160
a huge amount of work being done there

00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,780
and that's really cool when there are

00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,760
pictures of the people actually doing it

00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,530
here at the party in Paris you know if

00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,290
you go to a party in Paris you should be

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:45,300
hacking on vizio import so I've Alec and

00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,300
free draken to be literally in doing

00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,640
that that's exceedingly cool what else y

00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,800
ou le mama I've missed an L out of his

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,240
name it seems the base maintainer is

00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,250
doing a great job of improving base

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,990
which is pretty buggy our database piece

00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,790
along with help from from other people

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,950
doing some fantastic things there Marcus

00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,510
moja at the bottom is also awesome and

00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,890
many of these people be speaking

00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,630
actually in our dev room which you're

00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:09,750
missing now sadly it's kind of the same

00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,130
day you should should try it out and not

00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,360
only has he gone unimproved calc

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,370
performance a whole lot but he's also

00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,620
built our unit test framework almost

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,610
well not not single-handedly lots of

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,930
other people of hell but he's done a

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,360
huge amount being the driving force

00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,940
behind hundreds if not thousands of unit

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,000
tests exercising huge proportions of the

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,830
code which we now run many of them

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,150
during compile so you can't even get

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,790
away with compiling the thing without

00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:36,390
running the unit tests on since identity

00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:38,640
many of the UI may be all belts and duct

00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,770
tape most of these run on androids and

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,410
just work so we're confident that the

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,970
core engine is working really well so

00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,920
yeah as you compile it imports

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,360
calculation checks and spreadsheets you

00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,190
may think that's a waste of your CPU but

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,870
since it takes you know 45 minutes to

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,640
compile we think we can spend another

00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:56,100
two to three minutes checking that I

00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,260
actually compiled something that runs so

00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,210
that's pretty good we even imported all

00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,500
our old CVE bugs you know those security

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,410
bugs and discover the many of them are

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,800
aggressed so we now import all of those

00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,330
two are

00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,980
you know compiler so I'll make sure that

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,480
in fact we're still secure so that's

00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,160
pretty cool here's not done by

00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,630
volunteers done by Redick dilek and this

00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,460
is how he used to import our custom

00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,260
shapes it should look like that which is

00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,130
what it looks like in 3.5 and if you

00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:21,900
notice the difference kind of profound

00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,550
and with that we can start to import

00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,560
SmartArt say there is this beautiful

00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:28,020
feature in Microsoft Office that does

00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,880
this diagram creation stuff and we can

00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,260
now start to import those things so your

00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,620
slides don't have big holes in them

00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:37,110
where the SmartArt used to be what else

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:40,170
okay yeah and there's lots of QA and bug

00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,150
fixing Reiner is risen fantastic working

00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,700
and producing metrics of you know bug

00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,890
fixing and bug counts and we've even

00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,900
managed to get our files bug rate splat

00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:51,750
in an open bug counter plateau which is

00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:54,030
pretty encouraging so we're managing to

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:56,490
start to fix as many bugs or file and

00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:58,170
with your help we can even drive that

00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:01,080
thing down so that you know it's it's

00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,640
dead which would be great so what are my

00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,310
conclusions I can't believe it i did a

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,410
34-minute talk is that right instead of

00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:09,330
a 50-minute one okay well I'll have to

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,940
revisit some of this so here are the

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,140
conclusions co-chairing is nearly a

00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,120
silver bullet you know if you want a

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,400
silver bullet if you haven't read Fred

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,140
books this book you should read Fred

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,750
books this book the second edition it's

00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,190
very good it's profoundly embedder than

00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,980
the first edition in my view and read

00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:27,420
the introduction to see why um code

00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,800
sharing is nearly the silver bullet that

00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,790
kills the wealth of complexity etc ah

00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,920
rewriting a huge office suite is a

00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,690
pointless waste of time it doesn't work

00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,550
we have all of these historical examples

00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,160
of it not working it's it's a silly

00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,540
thing to suggest doing Libre Office is

00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,920
really getting a lot better it's

00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,690
actually fun to hack on it's a project

00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,850
people can be excited about belonging to

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:51,060
and doing stuff and because so many

00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:52,950
people use it your small fix their has a

00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,630
huge impact on lots of people in all

00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,520
those people struggling writing slides

00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,590
for their conference you know slightly

00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,600
less annoyed when they when they come to

00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:03,600
project them you know all of that good

00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,640
stuff of course the online poor yeah the

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,340
Android thing is useful in many senses

00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,050
it needs more work as you see if you can

00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,270
help out with that as much appreciated

00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,530
do you come and see me and you know

00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,870
thank you for your help and support we

00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,490
as LibreOffice are up against some you

00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,100
know pretty substantial corporate

00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,049
interest

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,940
it's that are fairly entrenched and we

00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:24,220
simply could not do it without the

00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,870
volunteers who give their time and their

00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,240
passion to the project and make it

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,890
something exciting so thank you for

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,990
helping them please do get involved and

00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:34,390
help us and are there any questions

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:45,880
that's that's where I know others a man

00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:47,200
at the back here go for it sir I think

00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,490
the question was about IBM lotus

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,549
symphony and giving things back to the

00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,740
community yup that's a brilliant

00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:55,240
question if you read the news you would

00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,530
be forgiven for thinking that was

00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,059
actually some code of being contributed

00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:03,850
back yeah um for many years and now

00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:05,340
about I class at five years or I don't

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,690
know it's really quite a long time

00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:10,810
there's been a great deal of talk about

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,550
code being contributed back by IBM and I

00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:16,659
I applaud the day when it actually

00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:18,250
occurs as yet it still hasn't so but the

00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:19,869
same thing has been announced again and

00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,359
again and again and again to the point

00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:23,770
that this kind of punch drunk you know

00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:25,300
when are you going to re announce that

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,460
you know Symphony is being donated to

00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,899
Apache or it's all going to be open now

00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,149
we're all going to release arcade we're

00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:33,399
going to play nicely honestly and so on

00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:34,720
and maybe they will I don't know I mean

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,010
I want to prejudge them and say they're

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,600
not going to because they might you know

00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,859
so we'll see we'll see and if they do

00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,330
that's great week we can we can

00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:46,090
incorporate all code this you know

00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,379
compatibly licensed and one of the sad

00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,179
things to me personally because I've

00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:51,730
invested quite a chunk of my life well I

00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:53,230
triad yeah a small sliver of my life on

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,450
accessibility and I'm trying to make

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,030
accessibility really good is that one of

00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,770
the elite secret cool technologies that

00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,210
they have which actually makes a real

00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,340
difference for the visually impaired is

00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:05,109
I accessible to support which is

00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,880
meaningless to linux guys but on Windows

00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:08,380
this makes accessibility much better for

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,720
the office suite much faster much

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,760
smaller without a Java bridge in between

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,650
and we haven't seen this and it's been

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,630
promised you know to be donated in a

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:22,720
functioning working state we can include

00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:25,420
for four years that's a shame it's not

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,670
stylish yeah so that's a good question

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,410
thank you sorry the answers not kind of

00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,410
smiley one but so

00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:48,530
yeah yeah yeah yeah so called Roy has

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,760
gallery so in theory you know in theory

00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,350
it's all done already like if you want

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,020
if you're on the Box checking mentality

00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,340
you know haha already do that but

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,590
actually you're right it's just lame to

00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,590
use so if you if you create a drawing

00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:02,450
like this then we can do tools gallery

00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,490
and in theory you can have all sorts of

00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,610
clipart things in here that you can drag

00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,170
and drop into their which can include

00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:11,360
you know shapes with call outs and

00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,440
connection points and so on you know in

00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,820
fact we've made our connection points

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,070
look a lot better in this this version

00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:20,360
let's get rid of that I saw and let's

00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:23,210
have a one of these guys so do but erm

00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,470
if I start to draw lines I think yeah so

00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:27,170
you can see these connectors now look

00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:29,810
sort of prettier maybe bigger bigger

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:31,580
bolder nicer alpha shapes so all of

00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:33,980
that's there but it's not easy to use I

00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,480
completely agree how difficult is it to

00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,890
turn all of the functionality that's

00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,630
already there into something with a few

00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:42,050
pallets to allow people to do that to

00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:44,390
make it easier not very difficult not

00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,250
something I customers ask us for but

00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:48,140
it'd be awesome if you helped with it so

00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,510
yeah you know it's it's not a big

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,980
programming task I think so yeah and

00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,540
hopefully the vizio work will see that

00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:55,370
because people import their beautiful

00:36:53,540 --> 00:37:04,120
network diagram and they want to put

00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:04,120
another computer in right order okay

00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,090
yeah the problem is that they always say

00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,260
but only if and then there's one of the

00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,610
three things like it needs an email

00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,410
client it needs a project management

00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:17,180
software it needs a media player and

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:18,560
Inter you know drive my car so there's

00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,570
always some excuse for not using free

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,530
software I agree this is a useful

00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:26,270
feature to have and it will as good

00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,280
isn't it yeah so brilliant this is a

00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,630
volunteer project it's not like in the

00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,400
past where there was one big corporate

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,840
entity behind it did everything and you

00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,160
could be angry with them if they didn't

00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,990
do what you wanted and there's no one

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,310
like that now so it's just us so if we

00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:41,060
want if you want the feature we get to

00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:42,800
do it so see me afterwards I'll show you

00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,630
some code pointers I'll help you I will

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,730
I will invest my life in making your

00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,900
project succeed and that's all we can do

00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,550
you know to try and try and help other

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,990
people make a success of their

00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,190
contribution seriously you know or find

00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,140
someone that you would be interested in

00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,570
hacking it's a cool idea I totally agree

00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,369
we need we need something will draw draw

00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:02,320
diagrams and make it easy to do too

00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:02,320
short someone else yeah

00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:44,600
yeah right that's a good question yeah

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:46,640
yeah yes okay how much have to be so big

00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,140
so you sort of answered your question so

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,940
the question is is it significant

00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,560
removing unused code I think basically

00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,090
and how significant that's a good

00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,890
question i didn't put that in my slide i

00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:58,070
think last time i did the metrics we do

00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:01,970
have eight million lines of code five

00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:05,300
hundred thousand methods 5,000 unused

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:08,869
whatever one percent the problem is that

00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:11,540
every one percent that you say if adds

00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:12,800
up after a while and yeah it's a

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,880
worthwhile thing it makes it easier to

00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,670
look at the code it makes it easy to

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,930
read it makes it used to get great for

00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,190
the thing you want without getting three

00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,380
other things you could change that

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,150
aren't actually executed ever you know

00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,470
there's this sort of thing the other

00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,540
thing that's interesting that is as we

00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:28,970
remove more unused code we discover more

00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:31,580
unused code so the thing is not

00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,930
completely accurate you know so and

00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,570
there are new schedules it tends to be

00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,980
the oldest or in some cases the oldest

00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,720
least Pleasant code so i think it's a

00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,720
it's a virtuous thing to do to make thin

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,740
clean it does make it slightly smaller

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,520
there's a lot smaller we can do to make

00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:47,720
it smaller that would be helpful but

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,920
hopefully the the mobile device thing

00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,960
will really drive that because there

00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,750
isn't so much resource and we really

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,660
have to get eager you know hungry for

00:39:53,750 --> 00:40:00,020
for performance improvements so yeah did

00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:05,230
that help perfect anyone else you have

00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:05,230
ten minutes aha different

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:18,070
yes your sis's here year so I'm the suit

00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:19,960
see basically I think so candy here is

00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:23,020
very interested in fixing you I things

00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,150
and so he he has a project to fix lots

00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,800
of little annoyances you know if you

00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,750
read the joel on software you know

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,340
barrels of dough thing and slipping over

00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,620
and then tripping and then stepping over

00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,210
the thing and you know the end of the

00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,800
day is not usable right so we're trying

00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,300
to fix you know remove some of the the

00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,330
bumps and the steps and the falling

00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:44,020
masonry and and so on guess because they

00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:45,190
ruin the experience yeah and so so

00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,920
there's a lot of little things like that

00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:49,630
happening around the place but some of

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,850
the bigger things were yeah that header

00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,770
things so that you know you can um you

00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,200
can create yeah those those headings

00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,010
much more easily let me try and zoom out

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,830
because that turns out that something

00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:02,380
people really suffered with creating and

00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:05,170
if we're lucky it'll work for me there's

00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,580
also a page break Oh actually it's not

00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:09,490
in this version so that we probably

00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,960
explain why it's not there um let me try

00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:14,800
another one I think this browser one if

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,630
I can get it to work had it yeah Andrew

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,110
oh I won the puzzle oh I see it just

00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:22,380
popped up behind brilliant um let me let

00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:25,660
me kill this browser thing and do them

00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,920
one here and we'll see that's quite

00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,540
quick huh do you think we're improving

00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,790
our performance startup formats perhaps

00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:36,250
maybe it's having an SSD I don't know

00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:37,420
that's might help so ya see that that's

00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,880
part of it but there's also this some

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,200
you know if you insert a page break you

00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,050
now have this page break line that you

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,300
can click on and do you know this sort

00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:47,920
of thing I'm to try and make make it

00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,930
cleaner inside the document so you see a

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,670
page break where the page break is not

00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,080
this sort of funny character in the

00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,320
document which is so kinda nice it's

00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,090
also some work to to make the page

00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,830
markers a wider name there's so many

00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:02,560
things happening and so many people

00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:04,390
doing it it's kind of hard to to say is

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,710
anything that you particularly loathe in

00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:11,690
our user interface that you'd want fixed

00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:14,040
you know that yeah

00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,060
yes we have this thing called easy hacks

00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,589
project where we try and encourage

00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,300
people to get in so what we would do is

00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:19,980
we wouldn't necessarily fix it but we'd

00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,839
write a clear description of how to fix

00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,570
it and then often people come in i ah I

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,070
did this free liner and you know having

00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:28,170
pointed someone to it's easy for them to

00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,240
do it and see it and get the you know

00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,359
the achievement hit and be encouraged to

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,920
do more Sarah yeah so we're trying that

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,200
and we have an intern who's been doing a

00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,829
whole load of thumb yam proving the glue

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,010
points rendering what is he being well

00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:46,170
Tim been doing candy Tommy see on the

00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:47,520
spot there we go but yeah lots and lots

00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,900
of little little feature I want one

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,460
thing kandi did was a searching you know

00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,349
so you can now do ctrl f and you can

00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,609
type you know down here and actually

00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:55,710
have a reasonable search thing and the

00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:57,000
problem is ctrl G which as everyone

00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:00,000
knows should search for the next thing

00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,140
doesn't so you know easy how hard can

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,210
that be there's even a button here that

00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,440
does it just needs a binding adding so

00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,869
that it will search for the next one

00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,099
right and behave as Firefox starts which

00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:11,369
has everyone knows is the right way to

00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:13,109
do it so yeah so there's lots of things

00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:15,480
that can be done there how me doing head

00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:16,740
of time Oh gentlemen here and then shall

00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,400
that be the last one no we have two more

00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,400
you ah

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,090
you're surrounded by Microsoft users

00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,850
will your situation improve in the near

00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:39,800
future that's no that really depends on

00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:44,270
them doesn't it um so you could move I

00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,710
don't know well so you know clearly we

00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:48,230
are trying to make LibreOffice the most

00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,000
compelling and and performance and

00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:52,010
attractive office suite that you can get

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,920
on every device form factor and get as

00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,660
many people sharing work on that core so

00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,880
that maybe the next three web startups

00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,140
that use Libre Office only two of them

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,490
succeed but at least the other one

00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,430
really helped improve the core and the

00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:07,730
next five device operating systems for

00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:09,170
handhelds four of which will fail also

00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,550
help improve the course so that the code

00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,500
gets better and better you know get all

00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,240
of these people excited about improving

00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,950
the product so and I think it can be

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,430
done I don't think there is anything

00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:22,040
that i see a Microsoft Office a software

00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,600
that is that much of a problem to take

00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,970
down I don't think it's a problem

00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,920
chasing the tail lights the problem I

00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,900
see is only in the ecosystem of getting

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,490
people to sell it and so there's some

00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:34,160
good work there being done by italo to

00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:35,870
build certification programs for you

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,940
know mom and pop shops and people you

00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,020
want to support and resell support for

00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,720
libre office so we get a quality

00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,280
experience and so we build the brands

00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,170
and make people think actually prophecy

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,300
is really good if i get support for it

00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:49,040
it will be good quality support i'm not

00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,320
going to be solder you know a tough one

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,390
I'm so we're trying in all of these ways

00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,400
to build the ecosystem but it it's all

00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:57,380
its work so get involved and it'll

00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:01,120
happen quicker how about that one more

00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,120
last question a heart back to you

00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,570
that's a brilliant question again yeah

00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,550
so the question was al fresco and

00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:11,350
document management systems so there's a

00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,880
thing called cmis which is a protocol

00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,440
for talking to wonderful document

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,170
management systems and there's a lot of

00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,820
interest in SharePoint I'm sorry to say

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:21,580
that many people out there in the real

00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:23,260
world however real that is are using

00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,270
SharePoint servers and building their

00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,190
business process around it that ties

00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:29,230
client office suite and server together

00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,230
in a very frightening way to get rid of

00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:33,880
and so we are doing some work and this a

00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,710
guy we just hired in fact my gosh who's

00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,370
written a sharepoint integration thing

00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:42,160
it's a Java so there's a slight damper

00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,720
on the enthusiasm but but it's it's you

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,220

00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,590
have sharepoint better than the web a

00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,060
horrible web interface so you're getting

00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:51,370

00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:54,100
important for us and we want to we want

00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,320
to fix those and alfresco happens to use

00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,780
the same protocols so he should just

00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,150
work cool well you've been very patient

00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,360
