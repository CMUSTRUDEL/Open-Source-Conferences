	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
it's open source distributions are using

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:09,389
for managing their own infrastructure

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,340
yeah probably right in this talk we

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,280
first want to give a shot in the dark

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,980
introduction around what the what

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,220
hardware we have what tools we use and

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,949
then just open it for a panel discussion

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:29,789
for a question answer session for you to

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:33,210
give you a deeper inside I think the

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:40,350
first slice are from my gaia so just

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:42,809
pasta okay so yeah so I have a five

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,800
slide to present our infrastructure so

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,710
can you listen so first we are a selfish

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,469
thing we have around 10 server from

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,480
somewhere I also counter arm board and a

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,660
small virtual machine so it's not a lot

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,829
and we also fasting almost since our

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,650
four day we are using our lots of my

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,020
appetite for to configure everything I

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,860
will I will explain this in the next

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:15,420
hour session next we are using LG appeal

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,920
like I think everybody and mostly almost

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,290
all standard software as always nothing

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,409
a specific to present so I will let

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:27,509
someone else Oh speak I do not know is

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:36,890
next I volunteer I can speak for you if

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:36,890
you want but ok together so I'm Martin

00:01:43,310 --> 00:02:04,229
can you try to help the first the first

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:06,209
light yeah well um my name is Martin

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,539
suva halozyme from the Debian sysadmin

00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:14,190
team all in all we are currently six

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:16,920
debian system administrators Pheidon

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:22,410
this from the system administration team

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:25,410
here the rest is not here we have Luca

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:32,940
from Canada PJ from Austria Stephen from

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:54,660
UK and tola from Sweden Norway and next

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:57,810
one next slide no no no no no well what

00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,700
we provide is infrastructure for the

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:05,780
different teams with with in debian

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:08,880
which is website CD building Vicky well

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:14,370
very huge number of team bill tease for

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:17,280
example we run Center in Iran

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,639
centralized services like like email and

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:25,560
LD ap for account management hosting /

00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:28,410
change routes for the for the different

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,040
architectures the sysadmin team

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:36,269
currently takes care of about 170

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:40,680
machines at all all over the world with

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:43,889
at was 14 are different architectures in

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,060
I think something like 35 different

00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:52,049
hosting locations well and our daily

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,660
work we do is taking care of the systems

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:58,060
taking care of the hardware

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,790
and the tools and two Colonels yeah

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,160
ladies and capability as well so two of

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,880
the architectures are previously ones if

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:13,990
you tools we used besides beside Swiss

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:16,660
Army knife our puppet we use something

00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,940
called UD ldap user ID l dubba sell

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:23,260
threaten tool to distribute accounts

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:27,190
over the to the different machines which

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:31,240
is actually just a BD be dumped or of a

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:37,420
flat file dump of account and ssh keys

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:40,930
and so on where we use get for a version

00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:44,950
control system and puppet to have the

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,950
older configuration simply round now use

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:50,080
my useful wantering and newning and a

00:04:47,950 --> 00:05:04,780
whole lot of other software to multiple

00:04:50,080 --> 00:05:06,910
infrastructure and next one yeah i'm

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,430
from centers we have like around 100

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,780
servers we care for and most of those

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,670
are standing in different data centers

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,340
so it's hundred servers 98 data centers

00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:17,800
and because those are all sponsored

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,130
machines by people who run centers on

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,500
their hardware so mostly hosters most of

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,630
the machines are in the US and europe we

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,340
have no machines in Africa there's I

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,170
don't think there's one machine well

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,370
this might be one machine in Australia a

00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,600
few in Asia most of those you can find

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,400
in the mirror good centrist a torque

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,780
system so which is our internal

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,680
mirroring system for feeding the other

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,240
mirrors the official mirrors then we

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,210
have a few things like well built

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,910
machines and QA testing machines a mail

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,950
server web server most of those are

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,190
centers five there are still a few

00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:56,980
centers for systems around well we still

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,950
have until the end of the month to do

00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,350
something against that and tools we use

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:05,110
we use puppet for our configuration

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,129
management which also does our account

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,919
management because we're only for people

00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:16,039
in there so we just push ssh-keys around

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:25,999
and we're using zabbix for monitoring me

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:28,639
unless about the tools we use hello my

00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:30,860
name is Dave Walker i'm from the ubuntu

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,330
server infrastructure team incidentally

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,729
that doesn't mean i'm one of the

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,279
sysadmin we I'm one of the platform

00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:40,129
developers so perhaps are not the best

00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,699
person be seating here because I'm a

00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:47,059
little bit out of my depth there but I

00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:50,179
know that we we have a lot of machines

00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:52,159
and we don't maintain all of our own

00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:56,179
mirrors there was some mirrors also

00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:59,240
maintained by other organizations we

00:06:56,179 --> 00:07:00,919
many of our machines are managed by

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,679
puppet as well that was a big transition

00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:07,009
that went in a while ago and we do

00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:12,769
centralized user management using ldap

00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:14,089
as well we we also have one about one of

00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:18,309
the big efforts we've got is also

00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:22,189
mirrors in in amazon's cloud which

00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:23,569
maintained by Chronicle and that is

00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:25,879
enabled we would have a good experience

00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:28,789
within the actual cloud as well because

00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:33,439
people were noticing significant latency

00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:43,029
and yeah I think that's all I can really

00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:45,949
say about that um okay thank you so uh

00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:48,529
my name is Tom Calloway I'm a the flora

00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:50,539
engineering manager we run a wick a mix

00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:52,610
of windows and Solaris machine no I'm

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,899
just kidding it just seems kind of

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,249
redundant to be repeating the same

00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:58,939
things that everybody else repeats but

00:07:55,249 --> 00:08:01,999
yeah we have hundreds of machines we

00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:04,189
have they all run various flavors of red

00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:05,779
hat enterprise linux just because we

00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:10,699
need more updates than we can provide

00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:12,529
ourselves we also we have our account

00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,240
system we have all the normal services

00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:16,129
that you would expect we use puppet to

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,599
push those out we don't use ldap which

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:22,759
makes us special I guess I don't know

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,349
we you know we do a lot to keep the bad

00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,569
guys out and let the good guys in and

00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:30,050
make sure that we provide everything

00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:33,260
from builders to bug reporting systems

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:36,229
all sorts of stuff its a mix of red hat

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,669
owned equipment donated services we are

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:40,039
geographically distributed pretty much

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:44,839
everywhere except for Antarctica and

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:46,910
we're working on that one but we have a

00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,940
team of people that are paid by Red Hat

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,680
to be the admins for the core but we

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,690
have three times as many people that are

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,360
volunteer admins that have the same

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,190
level of access so we're very proud of

00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,420
that and we have a mentoring program so

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,980
that if you're interested in helping us

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,380
run things or build new apps you can do

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,200
that we are also a hundred percent free

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,620
software so everything that we run is

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,990
either written by us to solve a specific

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,240
purpose and is released as free software

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,100
or it is free software that we found for

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,750
other places stuff like nagios that you

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:24,529
know keeps our pagers and their phones

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:26,600
beeping all night long so that's it okay

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:30,740
it's time for me I'm nos folk from the

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,589
opensuse infrastructure team and well I

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,910
noticed that I have to be here right

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:40,160
some minutes before so what we have and

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:44,529
what makes us different is maybe that we

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:49,040
are paid by novel or no bye Zuzu and

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:51,440
what we have is differentiator is that

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,250
we are using proprietary stuff and

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,230
that's especially for the accounts for

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,170
all our users we are using the novel

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:04,220
access manager there and currently

00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:06,529
trying to migrate to ldap so there's

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,529
work in progress all the other tools

00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:13,790
that I hear it here are also used by us

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:16,160
and some other thing that makes us

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,230
currently a bit different maybe is our

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,630
build farm with the opensuse build

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,630
service which is also managed by my team

00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:28,040
okay

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,160
open for discussion are open for

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,529
questions other any questions you would

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:41,949
like to ask your favorite linux

00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:41,949
distribution sure

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,140
could you just repeat the question the

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,630
question was about dedicated building

00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,530
machines yes debian has dedicated

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:04,140
machines used for building binary

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:07,940
package out of the source code I think

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:11,460
that's the most heart of our interest

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:14,790
infrastructure even each architecture

00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:29,460
has about two to four bill tease at the

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:31,380
moment to build software so yes can you

00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:36,110
comment on that you're probably a bit

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,110
nearer to the bill tease stuff yep

00:11:39,800 --> 00:12:01,130
believe micro hold yeah just come down I

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,130
will

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:20,399
okay so yes the questions may be a bit

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,040
different is not about the bill demands

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,449
for buildings automatically listings

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,470
that are uploaded in the archive but

00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:29,579
build services or user can upload a

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,860
package to web interface and it's

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,540
automatically built it's not something

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,819
we have in debian but we have what we

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,249
call Porter box so for all the

00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:41,429
architectures people live in developer

00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:43,589
have access to the machine they can ask

00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:45,929
for package to be installed and they can

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:48,720
debug or build packages their inner

00:12:45,929 --> 00:13:02,910
inner fruit Adam if it answers the

00:12:48,720 --> 00:13:04,410
question yeah well the you build the

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,959
package you want to upload you build it

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,999
at home for one architectures it's

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,829
arrived in the archive and then the bill

00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:12,829
demands will for the other architectures

00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:24,600
so so on that note is Debian the only

00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,490
distribution which allows packages to be

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,129
built and uploaded and published in

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,790
their archive which aren't built from

00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:36,869
the infrastructure I think currently yes

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:40,850
but ftp masters are going to change that

00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:44,699
that all binary packages are built on

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:47,129
debian system administrators bill demons

00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:50,279
this is going to change I don't know

00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:52,679
exactly when but there is a planning for

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:55,220
that is there any other dish tray which

00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,220
allows that

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:10,189
can't be hurt hmm that was from gentle

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:22,230
but it's not it's not binary blobs

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:25,129
though is it trading we have a machine

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:29,220
that as a continuous building of

00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:31,740
packages in various configure flags

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,819
configured switches so we can test the

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:38,310
various configurations of the flags but

00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:41,459
when the actual person uploads I mean

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,230
it's built by the distribution managed

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,519
infrastructure it's not by individual

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,790
developers right swelled by the

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:51,540
individual users but I think about

00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:54,660
anyone can upload sore source packages

00:14:51,540 --> 00:15:07,529
that point to any binary so okay thank

00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:17,759
you any other questions from the fork

00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:20,209
okay okay excuse me thank you well I

00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:24,059
have a question for every one of you

00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:26,870
well I'm wanting to create a new

00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:30,500
distribution I need an infrastructure

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:33,750
which one of you can provide me a

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,139
ready-to-use infrastructure for a new

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,139
distribution

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,769
we'll start this no more yeah so I hear

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:47,519
canonical is more than willing to do

00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:49,260
that for you find a roupa right / pet

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,269
stuff but you need to install and I

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:55,800
think you should show something done by

00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:57,240
someone I designers depends of you just

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:04,320
need hardware or if you need to build

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:06,810
service ok ok so it's I guess the same

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,360
for all distributions somewhere you can

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,920
find the svn or gate code where all the

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,200
puppets stuff is sort and then deployed

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:17,010
and hopefully you find the right

00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:19,649
distribution while my answer it will be

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,450
a little bit different because everybody

00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:24,720
used almost the same tools you have

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,459
heard about lda p pat pat sometimes

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,959
differ but usually there's all the same

00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,990
tools but the question you have to

00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,860
answer first is which are your goal

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,209
which are the problem you want to solve

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,850
within your infrastructure if we want to

00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:37,529
solve something and if it's not so if

00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,930
it's not solved yet if it's not done yet

00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:43,880
we are at an open source conference so

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,880
build it do it yourself raise it free

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:55,350
what do you help I would say you're

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,480
crazy why I mean honestly you must be so

00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,750
crazy since I mean I don't think people

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,390
appreciate how much effort has to go in

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,339
by every distribution just to try and

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,870
get to the state they are and you know

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:11,309
without a substantial sort of manpower

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:14,130
it's just the actual testing alone as

00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:15,720
the let alone yet we restructure but to

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,480
actually answer what you actually asked

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,290
rather than just assaulting you I I

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,709
should probably say that something you

00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:28,050
want to is developed mainly around our

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,580
bug tracking and specification and hope

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,410
to the project management suite is

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,990
called launchpad and one of the

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:36,450
functionalities that offers is we open

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,750
our bill DS to other people to use and

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:42,630
there i think all packaged archives so

00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:46,320
you can upload source packages for any

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:49,140
ubuntu be supported release and we build

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,850
it and we publish it it's not promising

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,350
to be on a fast pipe

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,299
you know is in you know you might want

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,900
to be mirroring from there which is

00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:59,669
something there was a distribution I

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,919
created based on your buns who called

00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:04,380
mythbuntu always vote with many others

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,030
but what we did for our users to be able

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,210
to get in faster archive so it's based

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,460
on ubuntu we actually mirrored from the

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,919
published archives that launch pad

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,320
provides and our users were happy with

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,510
that we just had that honor there are

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,370
sink or apt mirror or something I can't

00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,760
remember now Berta but that that worked

00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:29,070
quite well so yes we can assist with

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:31,140
people doing that well the thing you

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,480
should be aware of said the system

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,270
administration if you do it for free

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,250
project is quite a lot of stuff to do

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:43,500
currently I think every one of the

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:45,710
system administration team spends one to

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,870
two hours a day doing the system

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:52,020
administration for the 170 server

00:18:48,870 --> 00:19:12,360
something like this so um it's a lot

00:18:52,020 --> 00:19:14,190
time to spend any more questions hold on

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:20,630
we're just over your first have the

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:25,650
microphone oh so sorry I'm a question um

00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:30,270
so how many of you runs services and not

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:32,159
just machines like people making web

00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,620
apps or something that you hosting your

00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,320
machines and that's usually not the

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:40,020
people doing sysadmin and so I wanted to

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,260
ask in your environment what's the

00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,850
relationship to maintain like list of

00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:49,200
responsible people you have some

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:51,990
coordination among web services and also

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,820
I would like to ask if you have internal

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:58,200
who of you has internal infrastructure

00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:00,960
like amqp servers or something not just

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,840
bare hardik management but a bit more

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:08,570
high-level to offer more

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:14,360
nation inside your machines do you guys

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:17,180
have the mic down there well for Debian

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:21,170
we recently created a debian services

00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:25,370
admin list trying to do some

00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:27,410
coordination there it's still growing

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:31,610
it's still in the in the process of

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:34,210
forming itself we do have a QA team

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:38,330
which runs a lot of web services and

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:42,110
which usually just contacts the DSA ewn

00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:45,860
system administrators and ask and for

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:49,220
most of the parts we allow the users to

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:53,030
do quite a lot of things to do their

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:56,630
selves if there are within our within

00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:59,390
certain groups so reloading Apache for

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:03,140
instance as one of the things if the

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:05,600
configuration is sane than a people a

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,390
group of persons not belonging to the

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:18,050
system administrators are able to do so

00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:20,840
as well so regarding services we provide

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:23,270
for the bunch of community we provide

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,640
some hosting for some of our community

00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:32,600
our geographic separated communities

00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:34,610
their websites and we also there are a

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,990
number of services we also provide to

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,230
you bunch of members people have shown a

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,810
sustained and significant contribution

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,970
towards you bun to also allow w bandra

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:47,020
com email address and that's something

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:50,300
which is managed as well and that's a

00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:52,640
redirection or an alias so that that's a

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,230
public service but I mean there there

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,850
there there's also a fine line between

00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:00,950
what is the canonical being that the

00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:03,260
company there's a lot of input into you

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,880
bun to they have a lot of significant

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,680
restructure which also overlaps with the

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,700
the budget projects infrastructure as

00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,740
well and so there's kind of difficult to

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,030
sort of draw a line between some of the

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,690
services which are provided because

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:19,200
there's some which avoided for

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,549
this side of canonical for such as

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,590
internal telephony and things like that

00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:27,210
I mean that that's insane babies data

00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:28,470
center and things so we also test

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,799
somewhere own software such as we have

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:34,289
an internal OpenStack which we pulled

00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,730
canola stack which allows people to be

00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:37,649
able to spin up Aaron instances and

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:40,500
built have an internal cloud which is a

00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:46,049
hybrid public-private so I mean we have

00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,519
some to the split infrastructure and we

00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:49,350
don't have that many services when my

00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:53,700
other people but there are few instances

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:55,830
like the French forums they are not run

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,389
by they run on a machine of ours but

00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,129
they're not run by ourselves or one of

00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:01,169
the key a people's not in the sysadmin

00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:04,529
team he's running a Jenkins instance for

00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:06,210
continuous integration and the few other

00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:07,710
things like that so if you want to do

00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,210
something for the project nice able and

00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,700
need hardware for that I need however

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,669
for doing so my opinion and if we know

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,669
you from at least I RC or at best

00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:21,809
personally you normally are able to get

00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:24,720
a vm from us to do that I just gotta sad

00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:26,340
guys had one more thing there the actual

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,980
you bunch of you forums used to be

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,070
purely community hosted and which

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:34,049
weren't involved with the clinical and

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:36,149
there was an incident a few years ago

00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:39,590
where the forums got hacked because you

00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:42,960
know these PHP forums there that their

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,340
time bomb and he actually did you bun to

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,139
a lot of damage because it said hey you

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,879
bunt who's been hacked they want you

00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:49,919
must be insecure and they actually did

00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:51,600
you bunch of a lot of damage so the

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,769
actual sis happening teams they had to

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,240
get more involved with the actual

00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:57,919
management of the forums purely because

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,919
the the damage it caused

00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:07,690
okay what we are doing is more or less

00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:10,330
like providing an infrastructure if

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,940
people come to us and ask if they for

00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:16,360
example can place the svn server for KDE

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,760
or so in our server rooms it's sometimes

00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:22,000
a bit of a discussion if it's okay or

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,970
not but most of the time or CDOs are

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,270
agreed and what we provide for the

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:31,210
opensuse infrastructure is also the same

00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,250
it depends what people need if they say

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,110
okay I'm a crazy web developer and I

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,720
need everything to develop my web

00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:39,580
applications they get a virtual machine

00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,770
from us and get everything that they

00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,960
need on this machine and if they say

00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:46,210
okay I me crazy web developer but I

00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,720
don't even know anything about system

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:52,060
administration we share so we have the

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,640
login for doing all the updates and all

00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,950
the configuration stuff and they get the

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,880
same login for all their web apps and

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:04,530
setting up and so on so it's sharing and

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,330
the most problem I guess for all here is

00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:11,020
communication inside the community

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:13,990
because most of the time us system

00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:16,420
administrator you notice when a problem

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:19,330
occurs and then you have to figure out

00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,940
is the person behind this service still

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:25,300
available or have you fix it on your own

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:27,220
and this is what we are running into not

00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,160
much often but sometimes you're running

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,190
through this issue and then it depends

00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,440
on the system administrator is he

00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:37,960
willing enough to fix the service and

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,910
afterwards when the original maintainer

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,040
comes back gives it back to him and say

00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,470
okay I did this changes and everything

00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,110
is back or more or less in a stable

00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:52,240
state now or if you said okay I can fix

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:55,210
it just disable it so far far is there

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,850
is almost no dedication we are trying to

00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,310
do something because there is only a 24

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,980
hour / days and we are producing like

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:05,380
eating on IRC or discussing than doing

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,150
sis admin but so far we are still doing

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,030
a lot of seasoned men in the team and

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:12,760
there is no external services that are

00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,120
and led by someone else or it's not part

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,740
of the

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,380
official infrastructure for example

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,380
there is a fan forum which is done by

00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:25,930
someone with note in the team and which

00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:28,930
is clearly separate so in fedora we

00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:30,490
actually do a lot of this we have a lot

00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,200
of ongoing web application development

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,030
that's happening at all times and we

00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,980
coordinate that with our system

00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,480
administration team so that there is a

00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,220
clean hand off in a relationship that

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,960
says that you know you were there were

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,550
responsible for the content we are

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,190
responsible for keeping it running and

00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,900
that if it happens to break in the short

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,790
term well we're going to try and fix it

00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,620
and if you can't be found then we're

00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:52,420
gonna fix it without you and if you can

00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,320
be found then we'll come up with a

00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:59,460
better long-term fix we host all kinds

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,690
of services we do accept services from

00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,620
random people that come along but they

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,870
have to go through a vetting process

00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:09,940
it's not just here's a big chunk of

00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:11,920
server go to town we also work closely

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,720
to coordinate the services with each

00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,730
other because we don't need five

00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,800
different databases if we can have the

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,270
databases you know make sense and be

00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,760
collaborative and work together and

00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:25,240
integrated well and we don't always pull

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,429
it off but we certainly try we also are

00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,260
in the early stages of doing exactly

00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:31,390
what you talked about which is basically

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,880
amqp enabling all of our infrastructure

00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,980
services so that they can all send

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,300
messages across the centralized bus to

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,870
be able to tell each other what they're

00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,850
doing and hopefully have a standardized

00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,710
way for people to hook into our

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,600
infrastructure and be completely

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,160
separate so that they can be listening

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,260
for messages from the build server for

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,630
example and take actions as a result

00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,800
because we do have because of legal

00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,750
concerns we do have third-party

00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,210
repositories that contain software that

00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:00,340
we can't ship and it would be nice for

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,920
them to know when we broke dependencies

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,150
that they care about so that's the main

00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,330
reason one of the main reasons were

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:10,540
building that infrastructure up okay and

00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,550
back over to this gentle I just need to

00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,050
say forums lose that fear we have for

00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,080
some parts of our infrastructure like

00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:21,610
the build system appliances prepared as

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,170
you on them on our own so they build

00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,620
service and all the workers you can

00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:29,380
install on your heart here so it

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:32,740
it works send in the same way if you are

00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:35,559
willing to deploy them to spend the

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:37,210
heart air it's it's you get always built

00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,940
how are you get the infrastructure for

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,710
submitting sources from one project to

00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,720
the other ones who you have some kind of

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,630
distribution development infrastructure

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:52,000
it's not everything for your new int

00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:56,890
just distribution but quite a lot ok

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,559
girls in our hands up camp area so I

00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:02,710
have a quick question for the open build

00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:05,290
servers open Suzy people what I being

00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:09,010
all hard away what are we allowed to do

00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:12,120
a rebuild of / like just like centers on

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:14,730
open build server or do your things that

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,980
somebody would have a problem with that

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:20,880
and short it's called evergreen as far

00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:28,240
as i know but Adrian knows more about it

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:30,670
ok let me the problem is a trademark

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,500
because Zeus is a trademark and then you

00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:38,110
would need to have either rights to

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:42,280
reuse a trademark or you would well we

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,809
really remove everything officer of the

00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,300
trademarks and it would believe it was

00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:48,520
ok ok thanks and the other question to

00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:52,920
all of you what was the worst security

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,920
incidents you ever had or was there one

00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:05,710
I'm sorry what was the question what was

00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:08,530
the worst security incident that you've

00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:14,890
ever experienced the most security

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:18,550
incident worst when someone defaces some

00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:21,640
of the novel websites but that doesn't

00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:24,580
affect opensuse at the moment so I can't

00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:28,240
remember any real problematic incident

00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:30,880
that we had inside opensuse well for

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,070
Debian at least for the time I'm Debbie

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,730
a system administrator I am not aware

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:39,120
that we had any real security problems

00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,120
we have

00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:44,040
miss configuration problem recently on

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,320
one of the servers but that server is

00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,510
not directly run by the Debian system

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,270
administration team only accounts had

00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:54,930
been handed out through the usual

00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:59,880
account database system the person's

00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:02,730
runnings those servers or not the

00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:07,340
machines the machine that happened was

00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:11,940
not ex exactly a debian da dark machine

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:15,720
we found in the past well like one years

00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:18,180
ago yeah one of the things which

00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,230
happened before I became so sad man was

00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:24,170
the breaking into master debian dog

00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:27,290
which was i think eight years ago

00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:30,600
perfect match something like that and

00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:35,090
quite a lot of work the debian sis

00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,090
Edmonds had to do was when we had

00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:44,040
openssl library not doing not being as

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,470
random as it should be which caused a

00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:50,730
lot of work for the sysadmin but

00:31:46,470 --> 00:32:00,060
actually no incident did happen on based

00:31:50,730 --> 00:32:01,860
on that cell vs h false um I can't think

00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:05,190
of any significant one something there

00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,790
then there's been a few sort of minor

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:13,080
experiences there was one web app I was

00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:16,100
doing which was a demo experience in

00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:19,260
because we were using federated open ID

00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,880
people were creating multiple accounts

00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,860
to try and get more free services and

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,680
you're playing cat and mouse to try and

00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:28,290
spot the same individual and in trying

00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,590
to trying to react to him but other than

00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,510
the openssh there was that that wasn't

00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:35,970
such a major issue we had a local root

00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:39,330
exploit which you could fit into a tweet

00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:41,070
which was which was quite good but I do

00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:45,690
think we're I think significantly

00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:47,940
upsetting I might be wrong now we

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:50,820
we had a Miss configuration issue once

00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,330
in a web server so people used letter to

00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:56,100
share documents no porn nothing like

00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,019
that but just shared documents in there

00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,049
and put some ads on there there is no

00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:04,049
melber with in there so we just fixed

00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:06,899
the success on those directories and I

00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:08,340
think that's what we had and to find all

00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:10,379
the stuff which was in there to get it

00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,789
out of Google again what was the largest

00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:14,070
problem because you have those

00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:18,379
advertisements but the sand rest at org

00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,379
in front of that that's not too good

00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,769
well just to complete what the hell's

00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,919
just said the fact that we are just a

00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:27,389
very small set of people we don't use we

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,909
don't expose a lot of things to the

00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:31,740
outside that's what other people are I

00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:36,179
usually say that it's a bad idea by the

00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,710
way Mara we are just less than people to

00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,600
manage the wulfing and then if i switch

00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,000
to more itself it's something like five

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,360
people i guess actually but everything

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,769
is managed by paper then so normally we

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,960
don't touch the machine at all which way

00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:50,340
to not touch the machine at all but

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,710
people are writing the puppet manifest

00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,139
are not the one doing the rhythm the

00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,059
monitoring at the end because it's too

00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:59,370
easy to ask some someone to write

00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:03,059
something and to check the quality of

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:05,070
his code so we try to keep things

00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,539
separate so people doing some season min

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,060
will not be the same doing the

00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:12,060
monitoring stuff even-even even if i'm

00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:15,030
in the same same team so that you know

00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:17,970
it's like you a I'm also doing a quite a

00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:19,829
lot of QA for centaurs and sometimes you

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:22,819
need really to ask people to some crazy

00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:26,669
idea the most to producer the better

00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:29,639
define a corner case so we'll try to

00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:33,060
split all those things out and separate

00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,909
the role like people writing security a

00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,859
fix security configuration and try it

00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,569
with someone else to just break it

00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:45,389
that's a better way to find security

00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:47,700
issue I think I we are tuned to have a

00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:50,190
security incident at least maybe there

00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,129
is a big one and we didn't see so only

00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,569
thing I can think off is when an admin

00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:57,200
forgot to clean the firewall and I

00:34:54,569 --> 00:35:00,349
knocked out everybody of the shower

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,869
it was me but things got a reliable to

00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:06,950
serve that so the biggest incident

00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:08,599
related to security well they they asked

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,400
me to change my password from one two

00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:13,849
three four five apparently that was too

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,700
easy to guess now I mean we had a we're

00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:18,950
very fedora and red hat as a result are

00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,349
a very very big target people are

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:25,250
constantly trying to make a name for

00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:26,960
themselves in the you know for Jan

00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,839
community and bragging about how they

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,390
broke into us and so we get a lot of a

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,859
lot of security attack attempts I can

00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,390
only think of maybe one or two that I've

00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:38,210
ever succeeded and they never really did

00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:40,460
any damage mostly it was just a lot of

00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,750
you know clean up after the fact of what

00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,490
did they get to did they get to anything

00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,329
dangerous most of the time they just

00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,890
crawled around in a temp directory but

00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:50,690
we do a lot of things proactively as a

00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,940
result of being very visible and exposed

00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,349
we have selinux policy enabled running

00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,000
on all of our systems we have custom

00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:58,160
policies for every application that we

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,599
deploy and that minimizes the risk of a

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:06,170
lot of things we don't run PHP at ease

00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,970
hey I mean so you know there's certain

00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,859
design decisions that we make we follow

00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:12,319
all aggressively we do a lot of logging

00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:13,849
we do a intense amount of monitoring we

00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:15,680
recently tightened those security

00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:17,480
requirements for user accounts and

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,650
fedora so that you know you have to have

00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,109
an incredibly complicated and confusing

00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,819
password in order to have an account and

00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:24,859
there were a lot of people that are very

00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:25,760
unhappy about that but the good news is

00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:27,950
is that we have a lot of security

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,300
conscious folks in the Fedora community

00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,650
that can argue about what color the bike

00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,119
shed can be painted and I don't have to

00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:36,650
worry about that there is no bike shed

00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:38,839
so III think for the most part you know

00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,280
I can't talk too much about the previous

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:47,349
incidents because technically they're

00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:47,349
still ongoing investigations just

00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:51,059
just to add one more thing to that you

00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:53,219
guys went over to two-factor

00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,890
authentication for ssh and you using the

00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:57,569
yuba keys that's correct do you talk

00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,579
about how that's working out with with

00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:01,440
people they is their problems or

00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:02,489
everyone's happy with that people are

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,719
actually really thrilled with the

00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:05,880
Yubikey arrangement has worked really

00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,410
well for us we've been handing them out

00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,930
to all of our admins so that they have

00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,099
them the the core important emmons the

00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,309
top of the tier have been using them for

00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:16,469
about two years now and it has worked

00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:19,529
really reliably it has basically allowed

00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:20,670
us to shut off access except by you key

00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,829
to all of our core infrastructure

00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,450
services so that that's the only way in

00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:27,059
or out and so that we know for sure

00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,529
there's this list of 10 or 15 or 20

00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:30,390
people that have you bikies they are

00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:31,799
tracked that that's the only way they're

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:33,599
able to get in is with two factor auth

00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:35,279
to that and certainly there are systems

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,289
where we don't require two factor auth

00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:38,999
to get in but for anything that is

00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:40,559
deemed critical we've locked that down

00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:42,029
and we haven't had any concerns at all

00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,940
since we went to that approach but I

00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:48,180
mean how do you handle some geeks tend

00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,499
to lose things right um I mean again so

00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,509
there's a you baqi server infrastructure

00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:52,589
that basically works the same way you

00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:53,940
would exactly think it would be so

00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:56,459
somebody does lose the Yubikey they go

00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,749
hey you know I lost my keys I lost you

00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:59,369
the key and we go okay we just

00:37:57,749 --> 00:38:00,809
invalidate that key and we create a new

00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:02,039
one yeah sorry i'm talking about this

00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:03,930
speed that you can get them a new one

00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,630
does that mean they can't work into a

00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,249
new one rose to the post basically but

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,890
again they're the size of a postage

00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:12,719
stamp so it really doesn't cost us

00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,430
anything to give them out we just we

00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,140
have a large bag of them and they give

00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,219
them to me and they go go around all the

00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,380
conferences to make sure that everybody

00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:21,150
needs Yubikey has one just tell us who

00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:25,619
you gave them to so it's not a big

00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:27,690
concern from our perspective for debian

00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:31,289
we also do some sort of integrity

00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:35,789
checking on the on the file system look

00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:40,199
for files that changed look for c times

00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:44,299
that changed on files and have a central

00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:47,130
database on that using Samhain and

00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:52,079
tracking down which files change and try

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:56,959
to find out who changed that file or at

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:59,279
least up to now we all always found the

00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:04,709
according sysadmin who did

00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:06,119
changes okay in about 15 minutes left

00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,650
you gonna get more questions and you

00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:15,349
have to speed it up a little bit anybody

00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:15,349
else got questions no really row okay

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,779
well a question to the audience and also

00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:23,400
to all the admins here how do you work

00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:26,339
with the community how do you inform

00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,369
community about down times about service

00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:30,329
outages and and so on Weaver

00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:32,999
infrastructure announce mailing list for

00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:36,569
that and everybody has to subscribe to

00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:38,400
this list or um public or be the persons

00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:45,089
who care should subscribe to that list

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:46,919
yes so the only really infrastructure

00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:50,969
which has to go offline on occasional

00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:52,859
basis is Launchpad and that is expressed

00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:55,589
through I believe identical twitter and

00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:57,299
also as a banner as well the top of the

00:39:55,589 --> 00:40:00,209
side this side will be going down at

00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:01,949
this time and and that I don't think

00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:03,659
we've had any other infrastructures that

00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:06,979
have had to go offline for significant

00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:12,929
periods or any periods that I'm aware of

00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:16,739
no photo bein most of the services are

00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:21,349
unaware days hosted in multiple data

00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:27,659
centers so we can minimize downtime

00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:29,489
irritated yes we don't have that many

00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:33,390
people logging into systems and down

00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:38,640
times normally are communicated wire via

00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:41,429
IRC or via internal males I don't think

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,539
any other part the backtrack I had to go

00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:45,150
down once because we had to move

00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:47,699
machines and I think that was just leave

00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,759
the old one open with the Sun well we're

00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:54,119
working on it and then come back the

00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:55,890
rest is either they're more than once so

00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,929
we just can switch off one machine the

00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:04,890
others are still in use and then migrate

00:40:57,929 --> 00:41:08,059
over we use mail and a blog post we try

00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,769
to to say to people before and sometimes

00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:14,930
just like when I rode before but usually

00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:16,880
is more one week I know it sort of users

00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:20,119
like to be surprised by downtime so we

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,150
just don't tell them no no oh so we use

00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,619
we use mailing lists mostly we have

00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,910
announced lists that are designed to

00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,289
have nothing on them but low traffic

00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:30,109
announces and we announce if we're going

00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:32,239
to do downtime we also do a lot of load

00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:34,130
balancing and transparent proxying to

00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,079
minimize the fact that we have to take

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,430
servers out plus we have a staging

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,229
environment in addition to a production

00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:40,640
environment so that we can do changes in

00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:42,140
staging and minimize the amount of down

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,579
time we actually have to have so there's

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:51,829
no real surprises when we do flip a

00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:54,319
switch over but I would be interested in

00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:57,769
interested in what are you using for

00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:00,859
graphing trends of some machines we are

00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:06,170
currently using munion but something

00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:09,499
like 170 machines with 30 different are

00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:14,359
different trend graphs doesn't scale

00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:16,759
very much with our rd so any any any one

00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:20,179
of you using different tools and know

00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:25,130
something about that we are using PMP

00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:29,689
for nagios so everything in one tool so

00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:34,670
this is only one so you have less rrod

00:42:29,689 --> 00:42:38,119
files yes and no pnp allows you to

00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:40,429
either use one file for one system with

00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:43,089
all services in it okay or you can if

00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:46,130
the system is really really great and

00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:49,449
produces a lot of input output you can

00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:51,769
also distribute it in many files okay

00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:54,380
well what we're using generally is

00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:56,989
zabbix for the monitoring but it is also

00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,519
the possibility to do some graphing so

00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:00,349
that's what we use and will create

00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:01,400
several groups attaching several

00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:03,229
templates that we have designed

00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,229
specifically for specific workloads and

00:43:03,229 --> 00:43:08,630
analyze that and put three on that so

00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:10,039
that it grabs it in for most if the load

00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,589
of which for example is not that good or

00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:14,509
is if you're increasing in a way that

00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:15,920
it's not foreseen for that kind of

00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:18,849
service for example and the amount of

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,849
users connected to the machine

00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:26,770
anyone else and yeah we are using a

00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,890
diamond formerly known as a bit formerly

00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:32,140
known as a big puzzle because one of the

00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:34,600
admin didn't like and abuse it was too

00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,280
complex so we use dogs Iman which was

00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,400
the same but at least you know how to

00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,650
configure it and I'll first fine so

00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,390
there is a lesser or greater than 0

00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:49,900
minutes or I would only come on to keep

00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:51,550
mine in but yet we used to use million

00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,110
and then I think we moved over to using

00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,370
pretty much straight i guess so that

00:43:53,110 --> 00:44:07,240
we're using sort of the same setup it

00:43:54,370 --> 00:44:10,240
was described earlier no map no more

00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,920
questions and would say we just finish

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,670
this round table thanks for

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,220
participating thanks for being here and

00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:20,910
now maybe see you here next year also to

00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,910
the source admins

00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,170
