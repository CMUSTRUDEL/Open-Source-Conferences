good morning thanks very much for coming

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,740
in here I know there's a lot of hungover

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,170
people that couldn't make it then maybe

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,990
some hungover people it could really

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,640
appreciate it I'd like to thank my

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,939
employer who does not know anything

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,789
about this talk and may not approve of

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,460
it when they find out my employer is

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,340
vmware and they are a pretty nice place

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,899
to work but I'm about to do something

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,809
that they may not like here's why I'm

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,170
doing this that's my son Leo he is

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,450
helpless and i think that the helpless

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,789
need to be protected and that the people

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,649
doing that protection need to do their

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:54,210
job correctly so here's the first

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:59,940
insight i had every security measure is

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:02,730
in some threat model somewhere could be

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,729
the explicit threat model i don't know

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,700
if you can quite see the print there and

00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:12,060
in the explicit threat model you do good

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,700
practices like Schneier security wheel

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,430
this is thanks to bruce schneier all

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,030
comes from him I may have distorted some

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,000
of it in the interest of this talk so

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:28,200
the first question what assets are we

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,090
trying to protect what are the risks to

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:37,740
those assets how well does the security

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:42,229
measure mitigate those risks what other

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,229
risks does the security measure cause

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:48,540
what costs and trade-offs does the

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,259
security measure impose and of course

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,600
the ever-popular lather rinse and repeat

00:01:52,259 --> 00:02:00,420
because you have to keep doing this you

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:03,479
can't just stop at some point so then we

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,689
have a different security model or

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,270
threat model this is the implicit threat

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,370
model and it can frequently dwarf the

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,740
explicit threat model that we've that

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,520
we've made

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,050
the implicit security model is one where

00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,630
things just sort of float around

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,700
randomly and nobody really looks into

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,700
them and nobody really test them and as

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,310
a result as with any other system of

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,380
thought that has no way of rejecting

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:35,050
falsehood it becomes filled with

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:39,920
falsehood and just you know stuff like

00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:46,870
security theater also known as ludicrous

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:51,200
 okay this creates a huge risk

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,350
the risk is that people who are tasked

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,760
with doing security and that's everybody

00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:01,340
in the organization I suddenly feel that

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,990
security is burdensome that it's onerous

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:08,630
that it's pointless and they take steps

00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,600
to work around their security for what

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,390
for any reason or none so if it's

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,230
convenient us sh dash capital are out

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:24,470
without a password anybody done this to

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:27,350
do their job anybody still awake okay

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:33,950
yeah the rest of you have just not had

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:37,940
it happen yet but it will anyway the

00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:41,420
problem is that when you have security

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:45,380
measures which are sort of universally

00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:48,440
seen as ludicrous you have this

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,450
problem where you have created trusted

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,220
attackers and that's the worst kind

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,180
because they already have accesses

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,980
inside your perimeter and this is

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,780
exactly the worst thing that you can

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,640
have in a security system so i could

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,640
carp about this all day I probably

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:12,640
shouldn't and definitely won't I'd like

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:19,299
to talk about how to fix this problem so

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:23,450
number one bring every security measure

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:25,760
into the explicit model if you don't

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,280
have an explicit model that's I guess

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,990
number zero

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,660
you want to do this a little bit at a

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,660
time and figure out how the system is

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,420
adapted you have this thing they call a

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,970
complex adaptive system I'm not going to

00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,760
go into it here you can like Wikipedia

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,280
it or something and and find out what

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:51,230
that what that all entails it's a very

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:53,150
freight 'add phrase so basically you

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,370
want to just make small adjustments at a

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,370
time and watch how the system is as

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,410
adjusted itself because it will and it

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:06,280
will do so in ways that you cannot

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:09,370
predict in advance so number to ensure

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,040
every measure every security measure

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:16,220
addresses at least one credible threat

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,420
that is also in your threat model it has

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:24,830
to do that number three review the

00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:27,260
threat model regularly right it has to

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,840
it can't just be static it can't just be

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,630
sort of Holy Writ carved into granite

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,700
it's got to be some a living dynamic

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:41,480
document number four engage the widest

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,880
possible audience in the review this is

00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,190
part of the this is one of the parts

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,669
that's going to make me unpopular

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:51,740
because up till now security has been

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,440
the province of a tiny jealous

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,470
priesthood and this is exactly what it

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,660
must not be in order to be effective

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,390
everybody has to be bought in everybody

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,070
has to have a say everybody has to be

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,280
able to poke up their hand and say hey

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,550
this is stupid why are we doing this and

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:15,790
if they can't get a reasonable answer

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:20,780
action has to be taken on that and as

00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:23,570
you might have guessed the next step is

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,030
remove measures that no longer fit the

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,020
current security model right because

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,020
they have to yes

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,260
the question is can I tell the

00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:35,270
government's in the airline's about this

00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:40,070
and the answer is absolutely I will and

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:41,389
I'm starting here today now well you

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,930
know there's a time and a place for

00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:46,910
everything and and you know protests can

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,410
be more or less effective depending on

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,060
where and when you do it and what you

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:54,860
set up in advance yeah I I have gotten

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,919
very thoroughly searched at the airport

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,260
for making an offhand comment this is

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,510
the kind of security measure that I

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:07,580
think needs ex bright loud exposure

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:13,729
anyway so anyone want to guess what the

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:17,090
next step is anybody that's right lather

00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:19,520
rinse repeat because it has to keep

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:23,780
going and going and going this is a

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:31,010
dynamic living system your threat model

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:34,850
is your organization is you are so here

00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:37,130
it is security is everybody's job we

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,510
have to make sure that it can be

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,850
everybody's job and that there are

00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:47,000
mechanisms in place to see to it that

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:52,010
everybody can do their job questions

00:07:47,000 --> 00:08:00,410
comments straightjackets we've got some

00:07:52,010 --> 00:08:02,630
time yet know how do we get this message

00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,660
to them how do we get this message to

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:08,000
the right people I think it starts off

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,669
with contacting the people who are in

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,970
charge of security in your organization

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:18,580
and asking them where they keep their

00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:21,830
threat model and that opens up the

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,889
question of well where is that threat

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:28,400
model do we have one there is a

00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:31,330
government agency for my country it's

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,390
called the Transportation Security

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:38,930
Agency and they have explicitly said

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,599
that they don't model threats

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,950
of course the next step when you hear a

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,810
thing like that is to contact your

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,899
representatives in government because

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:55,040
this is a ludicrous assertion

00:08:50,899 --> 00:09:02,420
for a very expensive and as far as i can

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:04,250
tell totally useless entity you're right

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,110
it has made money for people but i think

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,470
that should be in there you know there

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,170
they should explicitly mention that that

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:17,500
that michael chertoff is the principal

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:24,290
beneficiary of this of this BS yes

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:26,300
anything else all right do I want to

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,450
explain how I'm going to do my protest

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,730
well I haven't entirely I haven't

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,070
entirely flesh this out but the first

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:39,140
thing I want to do is make people aware

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:41,480
of the first cut at the solution as I

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,430
see it and see if I can get more people

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,070
to agree that that is the right thing or

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:49,640
two you know to give constructive

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:52,670
criticism and help you know help shape a

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:56,020
thing that is the right thing next step

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:59,029
after that of course is to get out to

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,709
relatively small organizations where a

00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:05,029
suggestion like this could quickly fly

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:11,150
right because you don't want to start

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:13,820
with Oh NATO or something that's just

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:17,029
you know i'm i'm already tilting hard

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:20,120
enough at the windmills here so start

00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:22,190
small work up you know take lessons from

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,230
what you've what you've done at the

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,420
smaller scale and push it to the larger

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:32,740
scale this is kind of how FAR's damn

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:32,740
happened isn't it yes

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:47,350
the question was what to do about bad

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:53,440
actors trying to subvert the model well

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:56,890
um I that's already a problem I think

00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:01,030
that bad actors are drawn to this sort

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:02,410
of to this sort of place anyway they try

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,640
to get in the smaller group and they'd

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:08,590
have more influence in the smaller group

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:15,040
you know this is you know this is that

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:17,770
this the security group attracts bad

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,040
actor the way honey attracts flies you

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:23,220
know it's so it's already a problem and

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,630
I think it becomes less of a problem as

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:30,130
some bad actor can't act in secret and

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:34,540
do stuff in secret does that answer your

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:38,260
question okay any other questions or

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:42,580
comments okay I'm here for the rest of

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:45,250
the day I would like to thank Meredith

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,960
