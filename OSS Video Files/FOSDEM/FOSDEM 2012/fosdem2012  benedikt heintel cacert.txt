just trust one of the most important

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,349
assets on the internet so what would we

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,049
be without trust in the internet just

00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:16,320
imagine there is a webshop how can you

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,840
trust that is trust working how can you

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
believe and what they're saying there's

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,230
someone who's sending you an email how

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,500
do you know it's a guy who is a serious

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,740
we're sending this email that's all

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,890
about trust and if we look back into

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,950
2011 what every seen some of the

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:42,660
certificate authorities the trust was

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,980
broken by folks like fingers and that's

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,809
what I'm going to talk about today is

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:52,680
trust real program in the internet and

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:56,820
how we can overcome this problem and I'm

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,199
glad you're here this afternoon we're

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,020
from first and there are so many

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,470
interesting talks and I'm glad the room

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,900
as over cool so there's one still once

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:12,030
each year someone of you want to sit oh

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,830
ok so anyway I would start I will start

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,780
with introducing myself of it because

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,500
actually it's always good to know what

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,830
we speaking and that's me I'm Benedict

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,180
title you have simple the first page

00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,070
actually I studied Business

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,810
Administration and computer science on

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,909
dumb university of technology in

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,430
germany and i graduated last year I had

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,000
a major IT security and cryptography so

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,479
actually it's all combined in this topic

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,430
I'm talking about today actually right

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,070
now I'm working as a consultant for a

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,689
for European company explains a French

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:54,149
company with rashes all over Europe and

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:57,180
my major topic I am working my

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:00,570
day-to-day work it's all about IT

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,550
governance IT security trust data

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,620
privacy everything that has to do

00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,540
related to things I'm talking to about

00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,570
so if you have any questions you rinse

00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,720
it work please shift it to the end

00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:16,060
because I hope I can answer the most

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:21,040
questions up front but if there are any

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:23,680
i put in a Q&A am right now what are we

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,250
going to talk to about today today i

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,070
want to address three topics actually i

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,650
want to give you some insight into a pki

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:35,170
until probably key infrastructure and in

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,060
to see I'm a six means a certificate

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,100
authority basics so it's just a broad

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,470
overview because I don't know what your

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,120
knowledge about these topics right now

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,090
so I want to bring you all on the same

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,390
level to see okay what's a Provost trust

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:53,110
after that I will talk about the 2011

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:56,350
cases where TV notas de gizzard and

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,450
Komodo of Fayed's and this was a really

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,360
big failure and I will talk about this

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:05,050
afterwards and lastly I want to talk

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,000
about see a search my car so what one

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,910
first on the one hand i'm standing here

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,340
for CA sert holding this talk I'm speech

00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,600
for Caesar and on the other hand I want

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,010
to show that there is an open

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,459
alternative they're just working

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:22,239
different from those commercial cas

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,030
we're talking about today too so let's

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,330
start

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,450
let's start with a few k by basics

00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:33,840
actually public key infrastructure is

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:36,900
always consisting of two parts you have

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,480
a public key you have a private key so

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:44,180
to each public key there is one private

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:47,819
key method the one who holds a secret

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:52,940
the secret the private key is a one who

00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:55,709
can encrypt d sorry can decrypt

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,500
everything as a sound and the one and

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:02,310
the probably key is and that's a name

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,790
enough it's published so it is public

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,819
and everyone can use it to encrypt

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:12,269
messages and send it to the one who is

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:14,250
private key so it means you have

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,130
something you want to say said in secret

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,739
from Bob to Ellis let's let's introduce

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:23,040
them right now so Bob and Alice are

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,080
there multiple the private key of know

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,660
Alice go to private key I'm sorry and

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,570
mom hasn't put a public key of Alice so

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,810
she can send Bob an encrypted message by

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,970
using her privately at her public key to

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:41,430
encrypt the message and send it to her

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:43,890
and she can decrypt it by using our own

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,410
private key so actually this is the

00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:49,050
basic and I vote go deeper inside

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:55,890
because that everything you need to know

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:57,780
and I hope sorry if you laugh you could

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:02,970
is it not everything you need to know

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:06,190
about PK all right

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,930
alright so the second thing is so we

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,900
should know about is what is the ca

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:14,590
certificate authority certificate

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,139
authority actually consists of three

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,780
major parts so you have the registration

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:24,520
authority the certificate authority and

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:28,840
the repository someone in our case it's

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:31,750
alice is a subscriber she has a set

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,120
holds a certificate she subscribe and

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,690
Registration Authority the registration

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,729
of turkey is a legal unit that collects

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:44,710
the data of Alice or any other

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:46,750
subscriber and processes to get a

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,979
certificate the certificate authority in

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:55,360
itself published the certificate

00:05:49,979 --> 00:06:00,130
consisting are signing as a keys given

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:05,099
and the keys and stores the public key

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:08,199
of Alice in a repository also as CLS CLS

00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:11,110
r is the revocation certificate

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:15,330
revocation yeah here else the

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:18,789
certificate revocation lists where every

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:21,219
certificate this is replicated it still

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:23,680
stored inside so in there is a relying

00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:26,830
party on every of think that's Bob in

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,969
all case what wants to new is a key of

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:33,159
OLS still valid and this and visit Ellis

00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:35,680
who is who does a key we belong to so

00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:38,320
bomb is going to check it from the

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,870
repository gets a key gets it as well

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,409
still valid I can use it to sign to the

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:47,169
subscriber what is the most important

00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:49,090
part of what we're talking about a day

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,729
it's not about the subscribers not to

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,349
rely on cocky or the repository this is

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,960
it registration authority and the

00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:59,620
certificate authority these are the main

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,229
parts of the CA and those assets needs

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,650
to be protected to validate and to keep

00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,650
the trust

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,740
how is it built actually on the top it's

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,590
a hierarchical CA that means on the top

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,530
you have a root CA this is a root key

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:22,610
start from a certificate authority and

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:27,500
the root key is a most were most worthy

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:30,639
effort to ca 0 owns from this one sub

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:34,270
cas here we have two are issued and

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:39,139
assigned with the key of the root CA

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:42,639
them can sign the user certificates like

00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:46,400
here Alice Bob and up to e I was just

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:53,150
looking up for some names don't blame me

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:56,770
on them actually the root CA could give

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,539
certificates for all of them directly

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:03,169
but normally they are sub cas for

00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:05,419
different cases so we do it in a hurry

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:08,120
to work i wreck occurred way and if

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:10,069
someone wants to check if a certificate

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,259
person right he has to check the whole

00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:15,139
chain starting from other certificate

00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:17,509
signed by the subsea a signed by the

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:22,669
root CA b course the only trust and

00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:25,069
Trust anchor is the root CA now we're

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,889
getting a problem I think because you

00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:30,490
know there is not only one CA there are

00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:35,829
hundreds of the CAS outside there and

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:40,909
you need to trust each of the CAS and

00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:43,750
this is there are a lot of ways how this

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:47,120
could be implemented I go to you too

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,880
here and I have another one in my head

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,940
right now this is cross certified cas

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,640
this means if there's one CA here our

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,730
root CA again and there's a box VA a

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,100
second CA they certify each other so

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:05,800
they have a cross certification that

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:08,899
means if someone would rely on fox CA

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,960
checks a certificate of alice is also

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,110
relying on route see

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,450
because the cross 35 each other the

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:20,010
second approach here is a bridge see a

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:22,920
bridge ta means both cas are independent

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:27,720
and on top of it or between them there's

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:31,230
another CA where where post cas are

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:36,720
relying too and actually this is an

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:40,830
enlargement of the hierarchical CA so it

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,500
means you have our additional antithetic

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:48,180
inside you're not directly relying to

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:56,550
what it is bridging 1c8 with the other

00:09:48,180 --> 00:10:00,390
and this is bringing a additional value

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,370
P course just imagine to see eight their

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,840
cross 35 but there are not too CAS

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,660
outside I said there are hundreds of

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:13,130
thousands outside and if each of them

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:15,780
would cross 35 which is other you have I

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,250
could say mathematically we should be

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,670
try to be either but I don't want to

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,980
vacuum with this there are thousands

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,720
millions of connections between them

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,980
because of the Cross certification

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,810
that's the reason why bridge CA was

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,480
established as one of the points because

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,820
every GA is just trusting in the bridge

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,480
ta and not trusting in each other CA

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,430
because it doesn't need to so what we

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,790
have and what all of you might know is

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:51,180
the browser's the operating systems they

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:55,500
all shift default cas and actually they

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,810
they take away the decision if you trust

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,260
the CA and if you trust the trust anger

00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:06,500
or not is shifting it away from you to

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,500
them they say we try to tell you you

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,649
trust root CA by default of course we

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,519
say it

00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:21,490
and that's actually a problem that go

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:24,279
back to them on 2011 because what

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,399
happened on 2011 and now that's the

00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:32,050
point you might have seen one of those

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:34,240
all of those headlines on the map and

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:38,519
those are just some of them it happened

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:41,110
to you see we have komodo here we have

00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,990
dessert over there we have given nota

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:51,339
dig in hotel was I think the biggest

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:53,529
case actually what happened to them they

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:56,139
have been in the browsers that means you

00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:59,740
trusted them by default and then there

00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:02,639
was different cases why hackers attacked

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:06,160
them and I got inside the system's

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:10,649
subsea ace like a DB search some

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:16,179
desserts only a sub CA over different CA

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:18,249
they did not establish policies licenses

00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:20,290
like the root CA and just to trust them

00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:22,660
because you trusted the roots eh so what

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,790
happened to them they got there they had

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,339
a daughter break at the throat inside

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,309
and just happened because you press it

00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:32,639
down by before and you saw firefox you

00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:35,559
saw chrome is a chromium they all

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,509
shifted a patch to get them out of the

00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:41,319
registration of the authority or

00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:44,640
registration so is trust the root of all

00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:49,110
evil now we're back to the topic

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:52,680
I just got some points why does he hate

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:56,700
filled and I'm not sure if this is all

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,800
but I think we have a big problem right

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:03,960
now you still have a big problem because

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,030
browsers still trust is yes one of the

00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,600
main problem i want to address at this

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:13,250
point is it's a basic verification of

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,800
the subscriber as every one of you ever

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:23,490
try to get a certificate from one of the

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:28,020
commercial cas how easy was it no it's

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:29,760
not about the money you paid two levels

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:33,230
there's the Wayne foundation where you

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,230
just don't want it

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:57,740
where they like some more troops all

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,870
right so I just who I just the lowest

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,170
form is very easy and the rest is very

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:05,420
hard all right I I don't agree on you

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,930
the lowest form your right is very easy

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,820
the lowest form is just the center and

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,070
information about that you own the

00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,589
domain name so it's like an email

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,120
address you it's very 5 on the email

00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,220
address that you only domain name and

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,480
then you get a certificate you pay for

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:26,510
it of course the second level the higher

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:30,110
level is your scent document but they

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:33,050
cannot verify that person we sent the

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,089
documents is a person who says he is and

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,490
that's the actual problem with them

00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:40,660
that's a very basic verification of the

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,660
subscriber that feels

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:50,850
all right I one guy on all right then

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,660
that's a hybrid of course yeah but I

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:57,030
don't know it from all the CAS so I

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:59,220
didn't set all days to it but okay

00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,960
that's good to know that there are cas

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,760
would do a face to face check we got

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,260
actually you pay a lot of money for it

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:12,780
so they should do it that's right the

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:15,360
other point is and that's a big problem

00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:17,400
or petition to is whistling of CA

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,360
services this means there is a big CA

00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:24,360
like Komodo who is reselling their

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,030
services to smaller series but dos es

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,760
are not following the same rules as the

00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,980
same quality as como dos and does allow

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,030
what happens would you be dessert

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:40,580
dessert what I think it's Komodo its

00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:44,520
main CSEA but don't poke me on this um

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:47,420
and Komodo has stricter rules and

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:53,010
policies than a diggy search hat so

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:56,730
recert got a goddess fraud and so the

00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:01,280
most question can we trust c'mon anymore

00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,280
to It's a big issue

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,529
anyway some things we don't know about

00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:12,660
is we kiss do we know if there are weak

00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:15,149
is used we don't know and some are

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,569
intrusions do we know if it's a root

00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:20,519
keys are protected web protected it's

00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:22,649
all about communications and we don't

00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,559
know if the communication is as good as

00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:27,720
as we expecting it from a company we're

00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:34,459
given our money to so these are reasons

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:36,629
why commercial see a space fail and I

00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:39,889
say it again they're still in the

00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:42,720
process you still trust him by default

00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:45,929
so what does the lessons run from what

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,849
I'm just talking about it's work need to

00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:50,639
be done in future and what should

00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:53,039
commercial cas do and what is the

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,559
alternative to that of course open

00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,839
policies open governance this is a very

00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:01,739
big topic and it's a very big issue that

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:05,159
should be done not only on by cas but in

00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:07,139
the politics too and in the open source

00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:09,269
community and from open source

00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:12,740
communities you might know it open

00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:17,309
governance is one of the main topics and

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:22,339
it's mostly they're mostly more open to

00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:27,269
everything than commercial commercial

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:29,519
companies transfer processes you need to

00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:31,409
know what is happening on every step you

00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,320
need to know are the process is

00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:37,139
documented on a via our them for IT

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,720
security and data protection do you

00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:44,120
always know if your data is secured do

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:47,710
you always know if the certs are saved

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,590
on the route keys are safe

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:56,140
and of course we talked about it exact

00:17:50,590 --> 00:18:00,010
identity check so what we can offer from

00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:06,700
CA sert is an open policy and open

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:10,179
governance CA that has less had built in

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,820
those moods and those ideas from the

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:15,549
lessons women room so this is a question

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,950
I'm asking how wat SI served and I try

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:19,840
to say what is our approach on

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,549
registration authority and what is our

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,470
approach on certificate authority first

00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:29,590
of all registration authority our

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:32,529
registration authority follows policies

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,539
and each of you everyone can just check

00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:37,210
our website policies are open for

00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:39,370
everyone you can even work with us on

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,260
the policies you can discuss results on

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,600
the policies and we are open for input

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:48,490
so if you find anything we're saying

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:51,010
right dudes that's not great or do don't

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:54,159
we need to change this come to us send

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,320
us an email we will talk about it the

00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:59,169
second thing I think is identification

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,200
checks we check your ID card and that's

00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:05,380
what we're doing here on in our on our

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,419
stand and mental NK on the ground floor

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,880
there if we check your your identities

00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:13,210
and you need at least to assure us to

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,100
get your identity checked and to get the

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,159
wonders of validation that you're the

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,830
one who states to be quite to assure us

00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:22,899
or at least to assure us this is the

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:27,610
reason not that we don't trust each

00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:30,909
other but we're human and we might do

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:36,549
mistakes for a might get bribed or we

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:39,760
might want to want to do this figure

00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:42,520
okay we don't know is the other one

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,159
really reliable on Bob and this is all

00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:50,110
about our trust and our trust model we

00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:52,269
say okay you need at least two why do I

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,940
say at least because

00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:57,009
if you're youngish or a few new ashura

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,379
you can only issue a small amount of

00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:01,690
points and at least we need 50 points to

00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:04,929
get a certificate was your name on it so

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,149
this means if you're young you're more

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:09,849
likely or doesn't mean young if you're

00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:14,859
new you're sure you more likely to do

00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:17,139
mistakes and to avoid this we we say

00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:19,209
okay you can is your last point and if

00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:20,889
you are if you're growing with it and if

00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:23,559
you're getting major in your assurances

00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:27,969
you can issue more point so it makes it

00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:33,879
makes the process actually they're dead

00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:35,859
2 points 1 is it makes it more easy to

00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:38,529
get more points to get a senior ashura

00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:40,839
but on the other hand it makes a bit fun

00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:42,669
like hunting for points and this is how

00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:46,209
we get the community inside again and

00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:50,320
the last point is arbitration that means

00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:52,359
we have our own arbitration system for

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,489
each of you has a complaint can just

00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:57,849
come back to us and we check out but we

00:20:54,489 --> 00:21:01,719
can speak a ruling about it so how about

00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:03,700
our CA or certificate authority on

00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:08,859
everything we do we have a two-man rule

00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:13,269
means the keys the root keys haruka

00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:18,369
ceremony has to be done even by two men

00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:20,589
even the server maintenance has to be do

00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:23,589
the done by two one is always

00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:27,459
supervising the others one cannot even

00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:29,979
not something without the others we have

00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:34,809
open source code everything we're on our

00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:36,999
sinus or a whole system as open source

00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:37,870
it's documented open source is open for

00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:39,910
you too

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,340
right or not and before we deploy our

00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,890
code we tested and we do code review

00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:47,950
reviews so we guarantee we guarantee

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:50,110
that every chord piece of code that

00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:54,130
comes into our systems is being reviewed

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:57,030
at least once and we try to avoid

00:21:54,130 --> 00:22:00,640
getting frontal armor systems on by

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:02,590
malicious code and we have audit logs

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,130
all it locks for a certification

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,170
creation means we we have always a

00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,630
possibility to check what happened at

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,880
what time and these logs are not

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,950
changeable from the outside just from

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,950
the earth certificate authority itself

00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:24,520
coming to the main question when was

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:27,640
everyone is asking us when does CA sert

00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:33,090
gets into the browser's that's a good

00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:37,809
question I cannot answer not ma'am but

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:39,400
we need to get gain trust and there are

00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:41,470
two possibilities to get into the

00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,050
browser's I always say it's spending a

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:47,590
lot of money or getting an audit done

00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:50,080
what still cost a lot of money and what

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:57,600
has a lot to do with spending manpower

00:22:50,080 --> 00:23:00,850
so if some one of you wants to work in a

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,240
certificate authority wants to work with

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:07,630
a team who is highly into this topic you

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:12,130
always welcome just took a visit us on

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:13,840
our booth and even if I cannot say when

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,460
we are the browser's i can tell you

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,610
we're working on and we're really

00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,610
working harder on it that we ever did so

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,370
you're welcome to participate

00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:32,080
in the end tomorrow at twelve o'clock at

00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:36,710
Ferrer we have our C cert signing party

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:38,450
this means if you want to become part of

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,580
our community if you want to have free

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,340
certificates if you want to challenge us

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:47,149
with questions come there or comma at

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:50,620
our booth at the cable thank you for

00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:50,620
this and I'm hopeful for your questions

00:23:55,749 --> 00:24:01,970
you said you you said it's not possible

00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:04,570
that one person alone can pray offline

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:08,899
certificate like for example new

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:10,999
intermediate certification right that's

00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:13,330
right how do you how do you make the how

00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:16,100
do they show that their own can do it

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:19,490
this is a issue this is covered by a

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:23,720
policy to you can reduce I don't have so

00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:26,179
all policy in mind to a part at least

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,940
you'll have to be super wised that means

00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:31,519
if a new sub C a is we should are

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,710
someone need to saw a supervisor and

00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,600
write down all the steps we have a we

00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,879
have a checklist what need to be done

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,539
and we follow this checklist and every

00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:43,580
thing not done on this checklist must be

00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:48,070
written down so this is how we ensure it

00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,070
how are you sure you cannot be hectic

00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:58,720
and we cannot be sure that we can cannot

00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:01,779
be hacked like being in no time but what

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,299
we can be sure of is that we have

00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:07,779
mechanisms to revoke the certificates

00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:10,980
faster than the genotype needed and we

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:14,139
have some mechanisms and the policies to

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:19,869
to inform the people first attending

00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:22,840
agent I did it yep so you did mention

00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:27,489
how do you in the browser so there is GC

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:32,470
a browser for your take on this how do

00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:34,239
we get on the prowl yeah actually I'm

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:38,789
Nigeria drive with this game around the

00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:41,919
short osea browser forum yeah we do but

00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:45,100
to see if Rosa forum actually is just

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,249
one part of its just a network of see am

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:50,859
of certificate authorities so there's

00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:54,609
much more than just them so there are

00:25:50,859 --> 00:26:01,210
open standards we try to establish and

00:25:54,609 --> 00:26:08,049
the see a visa cas browser forum the see

00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:12,039
a forum sorry still has a bit different

00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:13,480
ruling than a gift himself up its

00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:15,299
different routing that is more for

00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,659
commercials yes and it's not one-to-one

00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:22,289
applicable on our system so I work to

00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:22,289
the WC

00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:29,159
give me that the CHS that has

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,159
spectacular the council part

00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:36,379
really obviously vision where thieves

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,379
are stealing by using it would

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:44,090
microsoft in facing us

00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,090
it was actually a cake

00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,000
I could permit this one Johnson

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:56,659
largemouth company's

00:26:53,090 --> 00:27:01,110
and there's also

00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:03,419
you know it's a hard techno consensus so

00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,570
I mean I appreciate the work but the

00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:08,220
entire system is clearly long so i would

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,630
invite people to actually discuss this

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,650
further i know the high test will be

00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:17,480
having a pharmacist would appreciate a

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,480
containment will be online

00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:22,960
and that we do need just this envira

00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:26,420
systemic effects sure

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,770
100 and see a search doesn't fit you're

00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,160
not that interesting system but doesn't

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:33,230
know still the entire system yeah that's

00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:38,630
that's true of course dad there's there

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:41,680
are problems we cannot fix but thank you

00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:43,400
for your information about this

00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,350
questionnaire for you say the system

00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,020
needs to be favored because this we

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:50,960
talked about the browser system because

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:53,900
this certification system is is broader

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,150
than just going to let it dry yeah I

00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,520
mean it's a WC three really only

00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:00,500
concerned about which is fine we are

00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,430
mostly we here mostly in terms of client

00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,430
base and ones that I

00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:11,960
it's too beautiful

00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:19,700
we would probably would not at the same

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:20,930
point by an entire anything Nashville

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,590
problem

00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,590
is the fact

00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:29,929
relocation

00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:33,830
the Rev yeah the revocation system it's

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:37,210
a main problem but you surely you should

00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:42,159
you should discuss it in private please

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,159
yeah and the discussion

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:52,120
and that's where I also gives you about

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:54,850
right the discussion concentrates on

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,669
browsers but the significant issue is

00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,559
not only browser amazing I am working

00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,929
for ing back now and we're in the

00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:03,910
business of transmission of files

00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:06,429
between banks and other organizations

00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:09,580
and all those conditions also are

00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:12,660
imprinted by using certificates so so

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:15,400
far Road issues and only the browser

00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:18,490
definitely it is but on the front of the

00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,460
client really mostly just sees the part

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:24,549
of the sopranos and the part of the

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:27,309
email encryption that are two parts that

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:29,710
are very common very broadly seen but

00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:31,330
you ride every leader are there are

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,340
other software systems using other

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,340
certificates for encrypting and

00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:40,210
decrypting software as messages sorry

00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:44,760
and potatoes an issue as a whole because

00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,760
the industry and the penny pax

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:58,130
shifting from the fabulous that it can

00:29:53,750 --> 00:30:01,460
only be trusted it's both energies John

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:05,840
by a person can be held accountable for

00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,700
whatever they are not

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,210
nope arrived at the point that they

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,210
understand

00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:25,909
I think there's one of our cert guys

00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:30,890
what so answer it I know that's been at

00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:33,620
least in Germany some bank features are

00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:35,960
already done with CCS hurt certificates

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,940
in the in the background not the fondant

00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,669
to the customer but on the back sensor I

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:44,000
don't know that for sure it is done

00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:47,149
quite off macias or certificates in rich

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,370
bankers are mainly you also want to go

00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:51,590
wolfpack mobile search because I know

00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:54,340
for instance that the robot in the name

00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:57,690
is happening

00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:02,320
limits already where was our other bands

00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:06,250
stick to summarize in general the

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,280
district immensely

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:11,470
it's a very interesting thing yeah thank

00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,900
you for your contribution actually

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,180
getting this disinformation that I want

00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,820
to pack it but other banks diversity of

00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,040
networks recommend other banks are

00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:24,190
already using like album bank already

00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,990
using linux on their desktops and also

00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,450
known the server systems your service

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:31,860
systems and i think most companies are

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:34,720
using linux on the server systems so

00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,580
what we offer to from CA say I've short

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,580
I know it's a bit about it advertised

00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:42,220
man but I hope it's the right group to

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,190
talk about it's the organization issues

00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:50,470
that means that the whole organization

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:54,460
can set his own it all is its own see a

00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:57,070
service offered by CA sert so if you're

00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:00,010
interested in this please just talk to

00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,260
us and we can offer to tell you to have

00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:05,680
a question you just say the searchlights

00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,330
ago that it's a problem that CA is

00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,880
outsourced their activities and

00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,920
association yet the same sino night all

00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,070
toasting or sonoma not an outsourcing

00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,650
associate so what we're doing is we are

00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,570
not issuing a sub CA where what sequelae

00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:22,260
company can do whatever it wants to is

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:26,050
still in our hand so what we just do is

00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:30,070
we we make it more easy for the company

00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:34,240
issue a large amount of certificate okay

00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:37,030
so kind of a TI are so

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,790
no it's a little tight what are you

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:42,820
doing is we just put in the registration

00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:45,100
authority in the hand of the company

00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,429
what we're never outsourcing our CA

00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:52,300
system it's only the are a system that

00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:55,090
all sorts of company so it means the

00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:58,809
proof and the liability for the

00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:00,970
registration lies at the organization to

00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:03,460
organization admin at the organization

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:06,580
at my rotted isn't ashura himself so he

00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:09,700
agrees on the policies that we gave so

00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:13,320
that means is is in the same status as

00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:16,000
one of every other hour of our assurance

00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:20,800
so there's no difference still the same

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,290
policy alright does that mean that the

00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,240
you and only you fold all the private

00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:29,050
keys follow the intermediate sets in

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:32,050
your hurricane CA sert does hold all the

00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:37,870
case for the road and the intermediate

00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:41,860
all of them all of them what does it

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:47,230
take to get into a web browser

00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:50,260
funny yeah it's only a matter of money

00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:53,230
or holding up alright okay how do we get

00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,850
into the web browser son yeah that's the

00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:57,880
question we are asking our side all the

00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:00,580
time now actually we know what it needs

00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,760
to be done what what we need to do and

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,160
this is where we need money for and what

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,179
we use for human resources man pulling

00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:15,070
for is we need to get our software

00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:18,280
system through an audit and we need to

00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:21,550
check our system against the criteria of

00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:24,159
the audit and it's important that we

00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:26,590
don't want to fail wait so we want to

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,590
make we want to pass a ball at the first

00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:31,540
time so we really want to check

00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,490
everything every piece of the system and

00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:39,850
correct if there are any errors inside

00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:43,330
of thoughts inside and so that's why say

00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:45,760
it again we need you if you want to

00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:48,700
volunteer and help us in getting see a

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,309
certain to the bronze yeah I don't you

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:57,099
move where the movement is because

00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:59,109
so why don't you start trying to get in

00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:00,400
contact with them everybody's are all

00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:02,530
these things that are on the lower level

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,930
of your high levels ok so a little

00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:07,530
reason getting a loan lender is over so

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,030
busy absolutely always working on it

00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:12,160
you're right there just a second way to

00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,650
get into the browser's it's about it

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,049
supports of mass so the more people the

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,480
more companies use our certificate the

00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:21,640
higher pressure of the browsers to get

00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,390
us to let us in so you're definitely

00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:32,049
right but still the old it needs to be

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:35,130
passed any more questions or you could

00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:35,130
you please speak a bit louder

00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,320
see I suck

00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:52,490
presents is stupid

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:57,790
one CA some

00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:59,840
you can't use you can't offer a CI sir

00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:03,950
unless you believe

00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:07,430
users will accept it and you don't have

00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:09,440
the pressure to have browsers check your

00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:11,180
CIA there's no one using it on their

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,570
servers because they use for my

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:17,660
perceptive and then once you are in the

00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:21,290
browser's they can't if they effectively

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,450
can't revoke the CIA because there isn't

00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:28,010
for every server that's using class CA

00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:30,080
there is no alternative we're rights so

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:32,660
it looks it's nothing like you you're

00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,360
proposing an idea how to get into the

00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,310
process is it by budget filed by by

00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:42,230
grass root movements so it means like

00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:44,270
everyone needs to trust in websites if

00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:48,470
it was possible for a server children

00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:53,960
present here is my public case yep I see

00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:56,450
I sir and very song or whatever cross

00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,880
signing where

00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:00,880
to be redundant you having to suffocate

00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:10,050
yes so as long as the client one of

00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,050
those days

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,760
part of this talk also

00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:25,279
we should introduce redundancies that in

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:29,390
world well that would allow to actually

00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:35,710
revoke 18 even it is to is to fail to

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:35,710
issue one of the object a break

00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:43,200
I actually really good one proposal

00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,200
would be

00:37:47,500 --> 00:38:02,500
okay attention yeah but this is not

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,500
getting kinda not worked at Madonna I

00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:12,380
alright thanks for this comment on this

00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:16,369
all right any more questions you run

00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:18,440
custom written software or do you run

00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:23,690
what do you use the certification

00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:27,080
Authority softened oh I need to give

00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:30,859
it's too early Oh what kind it's wholly

00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:33,680
sales all written in to pawn the free by

00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:35,720
you on the right yeah it's a custom

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,640
written software welcome to results

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,200
available on some kind of a positive in

00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,940
everything yeah just definitely at this

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,640
open source everything is open source of

00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:47,240
all our systems so you can check it on

00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:49,460
our website it's not CSF central in

00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,440
terms that you can deploy education

00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,000
Authority for you put to the city you

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,150
could applied as your own certification

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,270
Authority EE yeah just a wizard of oz

00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:01,640
website and search for it I'm I don't

00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:03,920
have about about here 30 planted in

00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,290
about see a circuit on it alright thanks

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,970
it was one more person over there yep

00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:13,790
and milked a couple questions so you're

00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:16,250
using open source software but I guess

00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:20,510
you're using a commercial SSM

00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:23,240
order security month license hardware

00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:25,880
security module HSM maybe you store your

00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,500
private cranky golden the question it

00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,130
will be software is your private key

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:34,160
protected inside the one where are you

00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:41,330
guys Thank You question that's that's my

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:44,330
I assumed it was alright alright right

00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:48,230
now it's stored in software what we are

00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:52,520
going to are we planning to move it into

00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:54,320
a hardware cryptographic devices there

00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,150
is a planning right now we know now it's

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,870
and software it's it's less safe than

00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:03,290
enter to keep it in hardware but the

00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:05,570
signer itself as a machine with signing

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:08,600
the keys is not attached to the internet

00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,760
at least the roots root server is not

00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:15,080
attached to the internet if it's not

00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,580
really necessary using hardware

00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,560
encryption protects you against an

00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,480
insider attack which kind of goes back

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,640
to someone else's projects for how do

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,700
you know you're not being acted out you

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,730
don't know oh oh how can you hack a sort

00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:31,250
of a system that's not that you can only

00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:33,350
reach physically not wires in that you

00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,630
can reach it physically no it cannot be

00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:40,000
reached no it cannot expect it's not

00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:45,280
possible decision enter the place you

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,280
saw two hours

00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:54,680
we're talking about the root keys the

00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:59,599
roots kisses no decision is ours updated

00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:01,730
for hours let's do the design that that

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,829
that's not well that's what I said it's

00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:11,029
only connected to the net if it's really

00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:14,029
necessary it's a local network it's a

00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:15,410
local network has shifted so it's not

00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:17,509
directly connected to the Internet

00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:21,410
definitely not you're right there is a

00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:24,559
problem we may have ordered you have to

00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:28,819
go yeah you have to go through the

00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:32,319
network to find it okay next question is

00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:34,519
about Islam little transfers no oh sorry

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,559
there's no network connection and I'm

00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:39,890
not a critical system admin so I don't

00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:42,339
know about it already are serious sorry

00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:45,410
so it means it's not serious in the

00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:48,470
usual network cannot simply access also

00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:51,109
you cannot enter it simply the womb or

00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:54,410
get connected you get physically there's

00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:57,559
a possible you need a number of guys you

00:41:54,410 --> 00:42:00,049
need a number of entering systems to get

00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:02,150
actually even physically there so no one

00:42:00,049 --> 00:42:05,299
has the key to get you a box punch it's

00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:08,720
not possible in one printer okay ouais

00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:11,839
to man policy and okay it's a serial

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,739
line so this was just okay One Direction

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:18,960
was all right the second question is how

00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:22,770
are transparent are your operation

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,570
you publish a log of every time someone

00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:30,000
requests a certificate and things like

00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:35,460
that we publish a lot we don't publish

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:39,619
see a little lock salutes into policies

00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:47,970
where our definitions are that every

00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:51,440
identified external access quake has to

00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:56,660
be a reporter to the executive and

00:42:51,440 --> 00:43:01,470
bought into arbitration so are at a

00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:04,460
short time otherwise of the critical

00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:08,609
events and access engineers are

00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:11,510
violating policies I guess I'm just

00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:14,820
wondering about the policy because the

00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:19,040
possibility for you anyone on the

00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:19,040
Internet doing on it what's going on

00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,640
that's in any way possible right now

00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:26,859
that would increase them to trust you

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,010
don't have to trust some third-party

00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:34,750
auditor somebody's issuing third parties

00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:36,520
/ tickets what about timers I wouldn't

00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,410
want everybody who need anything oh yeah

00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:43,930
that's that's a valid point what about

00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:46,480
privacy so that was it mark if you if

00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:48,310
you issue a few issues an audit log so

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,190
this means a lot where every operation

00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:53,140
of the signer is stored how can you

00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,830
ensure privacy and I think this is a

00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,810
problem what we do is every every chip

00:43:55,830 --> 00:44:01,599
arbitration case that's ruled by us is

00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:04,500
published openly the only thing you

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,330
cannot see is names and email addresses

00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,790
everything else is published openly so

00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:12,550
you can browse our wiki and every

00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:17,010
application case we ever did this start

00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:20,109
there I guess going bit into policy

00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:22,500
discussions but yet the process of

00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:26,109
establishing identity is by nature

00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,760
non-private asking someone else to

00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:30,220
declare that you are a person and

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:35,060
they're declaring it somehow

00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:36,890
blue others here I don't know I assume

00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,690
others okay actually this is a rather

00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,760
time-barred I'd like to ship this is

00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:43,670
calvin to to all boost just wizard us

00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,160
and we can talk about it I can sample

00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,810
for example the certification center in

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,200
the snow he who runs the nation I'll

00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:53,870
take a actually what does have a public

00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:56,270
secure as well so it is possibly taking

00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:59,020
place okay so we should talk about it

00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:01,640
and we can we can make us more transfer

00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:04,010
if you want it so actually I'm over time

00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,570
I would say thank you first and we can

00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:09,080
discuss later because this was a last

00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:12,070
auction wants to take and stay and just

00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,070
no information

00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:25,150
