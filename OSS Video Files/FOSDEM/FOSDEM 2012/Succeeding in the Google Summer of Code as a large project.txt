all right hello everybody good to see

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:13,290
y'all here big crowd so this this is all

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,910
about some of our experiences mentoring

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,220
so it's not just about the summer of

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,660
code but it's about what kind of things

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,300
you can do in sort of a formalized

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,609
mentoring program to get people to stick

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:29,640
around so just the does anybody not

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,270
familiar with the summer of code okay

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,410
yeah of course Carol all right yeah so

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,640
sitting back there is the person he's

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,500
running the summer of code so if you

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,940
have any questions ask her instead of me

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,040
we can pass the mic ran later on okay ya

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:50,969
ask me and then I'll say I'll defer that

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:52,440
to Carol so let's see I was going to

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,969
make a graph for this but I ran out of

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,670
time to work on it so I just put up a

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,620
bunch of numbers basically we've been

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,899
doing the summer of code for six years

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,830
now every year except for the first one

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:08,790
and I took over three years ago in 2009

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,590
as the administrator for Jen to because

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,220
every single organization has its own

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,750
administration so it's a lot like the

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,420
dev rooms here where they're all run

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,450
individually and they all kind of have

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,600
their own rules and so just looking at

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,350
the numbers you can see that almost

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,729
everybody passes and on the right what

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,840
I'm showing you is of the people who

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,229
have passed how many of them actually

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,479
become developers later on and this has

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,040
been a big problem for us in the past

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,189
and this is actually the reason that I

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,329
decided to take over myself doing this

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:44,280
because I had more time to commit than

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,680
the person who had been and you can see

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,509
in 2009 when I took over we started

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,780
going from about twenty to forty percent

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:55,049
up to you about sixty to seventy percent

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,530
as far as people who stick around and

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,790
it's been sort of learning as we go so

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,469
we did I didn't come into this knowing

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,409
exactly how to do it I sort of learned

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,170
by failing and failing fast and often

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,509
and then sorting things out to see what

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,200
worked

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:16,069
so we've got about you have 15 to 20

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:20,720
people students every year and we go

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:23,090
through about 75 or so proposals to pick

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,700
those students so the first thing I mean

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,340
it only really applies to big projects

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,730
how many of you are in a big open source

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:36,799
project right now okay good so we've got

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,720
the right audience here so I've added

00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:40,430
sort of a lot of formality to the

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
selecting application side of things

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,120
actually keep track of everything in a

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,120
spreadsheet now and I do all kinds of

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,440
fancy graphing to try and determine what

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,290
our cutoff should be in terms of

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,120
rankings and I can say you know the best

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,980
thing that's worked for us is having

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,230
some level of consistency from the start

00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,200
instead of just letting an individual

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,700
mentors sort of do ad hoc ranking

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,500
deciding their own scale of what's good

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,000
and what's bad because then you end up

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,659
with a totally meaningless result in the

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,090
end and so on the front end if you're

00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,889
getting a bunch of people applying you

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,780
kind of have to add some more management

00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:16,609
which means more work for the admin and

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,410
so you have to be willing to accept that

00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:21,739
like I said I've got a spreadsheet I

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,840
track you know every score I track how

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,730
many rankings each proposal has gotten

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,590
from various mentors to make sure that

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,680
it's not just a good average score but

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,870
it's well represented score so for

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,180
example if we've got 30 or 40 mentors I

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,370
want every proposal to get read by 15 of

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,359
them at least there's no way you're

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,160
going to get everybody to treat all of

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:41,510
them because some people have better

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:47,120
things to do with their time I don't

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:49,160
understand that and one other thing i

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,870
want to point down here is it's a

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,250
continuing process trying to recruit

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,989
people into your project it's not

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,280
something that well if you don't get

00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,319
them a month after the Summer of Code

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,519
ends then they're gone I mean that's why

00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,290
I put some question marks down on the

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,849
bottom for this year's program which is

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,260
actually last year's program but we're

00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:05,599
still working on recruiting the people

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,540
so if you really want these people to

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:13,239
join your project you have to never give

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:15,379
up and sometimes they don't realize

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,760
until they're already working on your

00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:19,250
project how much fun they're going to

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,889
have and how good it's going to be so

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,400
it's kind of like you know dragging a

00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:24,080
cat around

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,490
by its tail to get them to start up but

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,560
then they get sucked in and suddenly

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,419
they love it and having a great time and

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,300
in fact we've got some people who join

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:34,100
through the similar code who are now you

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,720
know doing more stuff than I do nowadays

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,520
in gentoo at least so I'm just going to

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,220
run through my my three and a half step

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:48,139
process for getting recruits starting

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,180
with sub-zero and this is all about you

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,919
know very basic stuff right so if you're

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,750
going to do this program what are you

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,010
trying to get out of it because the

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,560
summer code isn't necessarily about

00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,389
recruiting people or about getting code

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,090
it's you set your own goals and you try

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,350
and meet them and so for us you know our

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,449
number one goal we don't care about

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,600
anything else is get these people to

00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:10,520
stick around up to the summer's over and

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,240
that affects the kinds of things you

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,970
track and the way you decide who to

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,190
admit and the way you decide whether to

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,009
fail or pass people it affects you know

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,340
the whole program how you mentor people

00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:27,590
all the way through and how you decide

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:30,110
well like after the summer is over how

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,930
long and how hard to pursue people to

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,570
try and get them to join up and so for

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,669
us you know if we say we're trying to

00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,599
recruit every single person we can that

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,909
means when we're looking through

00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:43,220
applications we're trying to get us a

00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:44,510
different sense than things like

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,210
technical skills we're looking for

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,370
enthusiasm and for passion and we're

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,690
looking for some kind of hint of do they

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,990
have a plan to stick around after the

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:56,800
summer's over but it's tricky because

00:05:52,990 --> 00:06:00,710
you don't want to give too much away

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,180
because their students and they will a

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,280
lot of times give the answer they think

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,780
they're supposed to give so it can be

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,610
you can ask a question like are you

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,770
going to stay after the summer is done

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,449
and it's pretty obvious to anybody

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,690
reading it that it could be a negative

00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:16,789
thing if you say no so you have to tease

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,220
it out and ask more subtle questions

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:21,500
like what are your plans for long-term

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,699
maintenance of your project you know how

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,659
do you see how do you see that working

00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:28,490
and if they say well I'll be around and

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,139
you know other people help me but my

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,260
plans are to help keep working on this

00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:35,210
then it's a good sign and if they say

00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,240
something that might seem just fine

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,770
which is

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,110
yeah I think you guys can take good care

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,900
of it after the summer's over that's you

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,169
know a big red mark in our book so we

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,300
mark people down for that kind of stuff

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:53,960
and a point that I always like to make

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,990
in different talks is that the technical

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,990
skills and things like passion and

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,569
enthusiasm are two orthogonal axes so

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,889
one doesn't counterbalance the other so

00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,509
we are looking for people who have the

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:07,180
technical skills but we're looking for

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,520
people who also have the enthusiasm and

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,699
we want to allow people who only have

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,839
the technical skills but seem like

00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,129
they're a full-time student during the

00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,210
air and they're here to work on code for

00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:19,009
the summer and then go back to being

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,419
full-time student and we're looking for

00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:25,009
people who are going to you know put up

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:27,169
the claimant all year round I mean as

00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:29,479
far as measuring progress goes I've got

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,339
a big spreadsheet and you know every

00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,469
week I'm checking in with mentors

00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:38,509
checking in with students to see how

00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:40,159
things are going and I have you know

00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:42,620
it's very simplistic it's just little

00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,930
red checks or black checks and the red

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:50,689
check says go nag this person for a

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:52,039
while so you can't decide how you're

00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,039
going to win unless you actually know

00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:57,310
what you're trying to do this is the

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,930
first thing we do and in the back is a

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,080
couple of tablets that are supposed to

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,610
signify the Ten Commandments so it's of

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,740
all about you know setting the rules and

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,759
setting the expectations up front so

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:13,189
that people understand at least build an

00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,399
understanding of what it's like to be a

00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:18,830
student with your organization so all we

00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,300
do is at the top of people who are

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,210
applying at the top of their application

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,889
and on our info pages we say most people

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,339
who join this program become developers

00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:30,289
and just by simply saying that we've

00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:33,589
vastly increased the number of people

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:36,199
who become developers by building this

00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:37,669
mental model for them of they think this

00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:39,649
is how the program works you work on it

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:43,449
for the summer and you don't leave you

00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:43,449
stay keep working on gentoo

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,880
oh by the way feel free to jump in if

00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,070
you have any thoughts or any questions

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,800
or anything because I've only got about

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,850
five slides so as soon as we get three

00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,000
number three I'm just going to repeat

00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:00,810
them again and then I'll be done so the

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,730
first thing is about establishing

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,830
expectations and it's very easy all you

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,490
have to do is just say so right at the

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:11,130
start and I'm not sure if that's

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,110
changing the people who apply or just

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,210
the same people are applying with the

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,100
different opinion what kind of

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:21,540
self-selection it is but either way it

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:24,810
certainly seems to be working on a

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,220
second point is to make sure they're

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,350
actually part of the community because

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,510
it's the social connections that keep

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,280
people around and not the code they work

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,670
on when you're talking about a large

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,380
community project so you know before

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,620
people apply we have requirements that

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,480
say you have to post to our mailing list

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,570
about your project you have to talk on

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,860
IRC in our IRC channel you have to get

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:52,500
to know the people to start building

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,290
those relationships even before they are

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,670
accepted and this is another thing where

00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:01,560
if you know the goals you can build

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,120
criteria from the start so if people

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,100
aren't doing a good job of interacting

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,940
on IRC or on the lists we don't let them

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,230
in the program no matter how good their

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,290
proposal is if they can't communicate

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,780
with us they're not going to be in from

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,360
the start and this is one of the things

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,900
we learned through failing because a few

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,270
years back we had to fail about four

00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:28,800
maybe five of our people out of 14 or 15

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:31,140
and in almost every case it was because

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,080
of communication problems that had we

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,420
tried as soon as people who are applying

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:39,510
to get them talking on lesson on IRC we

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,380
would have known first off that they

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,380
weren't suitable for our program

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,670
yeah it's a good question and there's no

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,930
perfect measurement right dhoni if you

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,660
can't repeat the question about two

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,070
people right because the mic so the

00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,750
question was how do you make people

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:05,060
interact on IRC and how do you measure

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:07,580
it and for me it's very qualitative I'm

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,100
just looking for somebody if I've seen

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:14,180
them on our IRC channel 4G sock they get

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:17,330
+1 and because we have a g-shock

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,880
specific IRC channel gen 2 dash SOC I

00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,280
think so if they're on there and if

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,440
they're talking I read every single line

00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,210
that's said in that channel I'm not

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,590
missing anybody and I actually go back

00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:31,010
to my spreadsheet and if I see people

00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:32,300
talking I I mark it off because once you

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,570
get a certain number of people it's very

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,740
hard to remember who's been talking and

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,900
who hasn't because you're talking about

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:44,660
the 75 people applying and not the 15

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:47,420
you end up getting in yeah Dave have you

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,090
ever heard of super serious stats ah

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,220
super serious stats is that one of the

00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:55,190
IRC statista yeah that's the one okay

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,590
you can it cuts it down by day by a week

00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,020
my mom fight you see people there okay

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:03,290
yeah I've seen some statistics packages

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,830
for IRC but I haven't really used them

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,300
for this and the reason is well you can

00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,150
you can talk a lot without saying

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,130
anything so if I'm just looking at the

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,690
lines of text that are out there it's

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,020
not necessarily the most useful measure

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:20,330
as the ability to communicate well which

00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,980
you get from reading what they said and

00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,840
seeing how they're interacting with

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:28,040
their potential mentors and what the

00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:30,650
other applicants and so yeah it's not

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,390
just lines of text just like it's not

00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:37,670
just lines of code that make a good

00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:39,950
package and one of the problems that

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:44,450
we've encountered both on gentoo and I'm

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:46,160
also uh admin for xorg is students only

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,200
interacting with their mentors and that

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,410
with the rest of the community and

00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,260
that's I think half of the people we

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,880
fail that's been the reason I'm almost

00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,920
every failure and the next are dark side

00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,930
that is the reason there is one who

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,220
somehow slipped in without really

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,699
knowing how to write code

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,379
I was entirely my fault because I'm

00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:07,579
looking so much at the social side of

00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:09,980
things that sometimes I forget to look

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,420
at the technical side of things he's the

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,000
funny thing is though he's still super

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,189
enthusiastic about x.org we had to fail

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,350
him but he understood exactly what was

00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:19,939
going on and now he's getting better at

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,040
coding and he's actually continuing to

00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:25,759
contribute to the community so if you're

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,139
recruiting people for passion you know

00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,230
they stay passionate it doesn't

00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,230
disappear

00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:40,909
and the third point is simply being

00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:43,199
persistent and sometimes as students

00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:44,459
people don't understand that they're

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,379
welcome to join the project as

00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:48,659
developers because everybody they're

00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,969
talking to seems so much more expert

00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:53,909
than them it's like if any of you were

00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:57,539
in Lydia's talk a few half an hour ago

00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:59,429
on the open advice book you don't I

00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:01,979
always remember what you used to know

00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:04,729
when you start it out so these students

00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:07,079
are around for a few months and

00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:10,679
everybody else looks like a super expert

00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,969
to them so they don't realize that they

00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,979
could be a super expert to in a few

00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:17,549
months and they're welcome to join and

00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:20,249
start the road toward that process and

00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:22,709
so it goes back to the first point about

00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:24,509
setting the expectations where if you

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,759
tell people you know we would love you

00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:28,829
to join the project we're you're welcome

00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,479
here it's not just we're okay with you

00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:32,129
joining if you really want to and try

00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:34,799
hard it's you know please join us

00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:36,509
because we would we wish you're here we

00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,829
wish you'd stick around we had we loved

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:41,720
having you for the summer and we want

00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:41,720
you to be here for the next ten years to

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,829
so like I said I'm just going to remind

00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:53,160
you of the last three things I said and

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:59,579
so it's about deciding how you want to

00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:01,860
win and then winning that's all i have

00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:05,240
for slides so if there's any discussion

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,240
like to have please do

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:28,460
thanks for the talk Donnie how are you

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:34,220
defining basically on your first slide

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:36,110
who a developer is for us the developer

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,880
is a nebulous term and Jen to you but

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,470
the kind of people who are working on

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,780
Summer of Code are always writing code

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,150
so that for the purposes of this talk

00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,580
that's what a developer is and whether

00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:49,760
it's working on the same project they

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,380
work on during the summer or switching

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,350
tracks and becoming a package maintainer

00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:57,320
for example all of that counts as being

00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:02,570
a developer after the summer is over so

00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:04,850
do you have some I don't some rules

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:07,550
around you know the person has to have

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,650
committed within the last month or they

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,600
have to I have to have seen them in the

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:15,920
IRC channel or some combination of the

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,570
above so so for example like if you had

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,400
a student who worked on a G saw project

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,810
and then disappeared but then came back

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,470
the following summer would you consider

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:27,290
that person a developer in the community

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:29,360
no because if you've got code what

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,650
happens to it when they're gone you know

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,120
it just sits there and rots the other

00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,680
nine months of the year I mean that's

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,080
not somebody who's part of the community

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,590
that's somebody who's there for the

00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:43,790
money and maybe the prestige we did have

00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:45,260
one student who did that and he seemed

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,030
more enthusiastic the second summer

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,880
around so we let him back in and then he

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:52,780
disappeared again so uh you know you

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,250
have to look at actions and not intense

00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,740
and then the other question I had was do

00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:01,370
you guys have any notes on your

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,990
application first for students firstly

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:07,370
with regard to that they have to have

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:09,920
made a commit they submit their proposal

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,320
or anything like that and then also do

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,120
you have any do you basically have any

00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,140
guidelines about basically we expect

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,310
that you will stay involved in the

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,570
community and that's part of the

00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,770
proposal acceptance process so our

00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,709
proposal we have we have three

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,570
requirements on there and the first one

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,949
is that they have to prove they can

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,960
actually use the tools in the

00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:31,280
infrastructure to do something useful

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,860
because we don't want to be screwing

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,980
around for three weeks

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,920
getting get set up and learning how to

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,480
make commits and push code so they have

00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,820
to use the tools they have to you for

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,220
example create a patch in the code base

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,830
they're going to be working on commit it

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:51,190
with get and post the repo somewhere or

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:53,380
they have to you know fix a bug in

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,179
bugzilla and will point them to specific

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,910
bugs that are related to their project

00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,750
to fix not just some kind of arbitrary

00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,210
hoop they have to jump through but

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,549
something that's relevant so the first

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,690
one is use the tools the second one is

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,240
interact with the community and the

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,340
third one is tell us how to get in touch

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,020
with you because sometimes people just

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,730
disappear and you don't know what

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,350
happened to them but if you have their

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,350
address and their phone number you can

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:23,650
go bang on their door and we've done

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:28,990
that hi is it my turn you've got the mic

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:32,650
I put up my hand two things first you do

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,059
a lot of work on this how much time do

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,160
you spend mentoring in the mental

00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:40,059
project maintain the mental gentoo

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,049
project and second is it something you

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,940
think you're going to keep up for a long

00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:44,830
time and and what are you doing about

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,210
recruiting a replacement for yourself

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,059
when you're not going to do it anymore

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:52,570
oh that's a great question so first off

00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:56,110
let's see G sock is a very seasonal

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,900
activity and the most intensive part for

00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:01,230
the administrator is up front once

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,820
things once the summer is started I

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:08,029
basically am there to solve problems and

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:10,519
not much else yeah

00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:13,399
let's yeah as the summer is ending and

00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:18,469
then after it's over so for me I spend

00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:21,379
about a month probably 20 hours every

00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:24,229
week during that month oh great we're

00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:26,299
actually feeling at the time yeah so

00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:29,330
probably about almost a half time job

00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:32,299
for a month during the proposal process

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,779
between when when we're announced as

00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:39,049
being in the program and when we have to

00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:42,019
submit our final rankings and after that

00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:45,950
it goes way way down and it's more like

00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:48,469
maybe five hours a week if that because

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,059
all I'm doing is I look at the mailing

00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:52,879
list and see if the students sent their

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:55,339
status report for the week and because

00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:57,379
we do require weekly status reports and

00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:59,839
that's my main method for making sure

00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:02,119
things are going on track and the

00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,710
students don't like it but you know

00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,820
frankly my time is more valuable than

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,999
theirs because I don't have as much of

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,999
it

00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:16,929
yeah and so as far as the bus factor

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,489
goes I have been trying to recruit more

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:22,749
administrators to work with me on this

00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:24,610
I'm in fact last year around the end of

00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:26,559
the program we brought on Leslie

00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,259
Hawthorne who used to run tree sock from

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,960
google to help with the gen 2 SG sock

00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:35,110
program and she'll be I think helping

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,389
more next year whenever the time rolls

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:41,019
around and then if we've got a couple of

00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:42,580
other co admins to who basically when

00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:44,739
I'm busy for some reason they can pick

00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:48,100
it up the former administrator is

00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:52,029
probably the best bus defense at this

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:54,070
point in time and that's exactly why I'm

00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,989
trying to get out there and do stuff

00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:59,559
like this so that everything I'm doing

00:20:55,989 --> 00:21:02,919
is somehow documented so you know even

00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:05,859
if I do get hit by a bus people know

00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:09,029
exactly what to do even if they don't

00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:09,029
have the experience doing it

00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:21,090
and I need more questions now that's

00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:23,580
good and so that was Tony pirkled thank

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:29,340
you very much for coming big round of

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:32,039
applause for him please and now we

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,639
should be back on schedule yes thank you

00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,639
