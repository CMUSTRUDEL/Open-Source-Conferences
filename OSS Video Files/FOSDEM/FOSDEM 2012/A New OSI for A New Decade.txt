no no it's about time for our next talk

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,049
so if everyone could be a bit quiet and

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,420
sit down a bit i would like to introduce

00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:17,340
simon phipps as our next speaker Simon

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,990
wears a lot of hats but today he is

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,910
wearing the while he's not wearing a

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,859
physical hats but the virtual hat he's

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,390
wearing is as a director of the Open

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,010
Source Initiative and he has a very

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:33,960
exciting announcement for us and now

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:35,460
he's wearing a beret thanks Ivan well

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,200
thank you all for giving up your lunch

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,770
to come and listen to me it's very kind

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,899
of you so this is actually the third

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,620
time I've spoken at for them I

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,530
discovered to my surprise last time that

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,430
was notable was telling everybody that

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:57,090
we'd persuaded the suit son to make Java

00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,809
free software since then a lot has

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,730
happened in the world so I'm now

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,000
unemployed available for consulting if

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,979
you need an open-source consultant and

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,170
it's never good to be unemployed and not

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,650
do anything so I've joined the board of

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,270
the open rights group in the UK and

00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,549
helping them campaign against actor at

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,470
the moment which is I believe going to

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,750
be our common cause for the next few

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,299
months and I'll take the hat off of its

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,159
alright with it again and I'm have also

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,619
been on for the last two years on the

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,909
board of the Open Source Initiative now

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,950
being on the board of the Open Source

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,299
Initiative at a free software conference

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,930
is often similar to pick an epithet of

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,009
your own it's often unpopular one of

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,310
things I've got to explain to you

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,170
however is that if you talk to the folk

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,939
at the Open Source Initiative you

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,610
discover to your possibility of

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,040
surprised that everyone on the board of

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,619
RSI is committed to software freedom and

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,560
real crunchy software freedom you know

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,500
not some diluted form that's there to do

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,380
something cunning real crunchy software

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:09,090
freedom now let me explain where OSI

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,039
came from the idea of free software had

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,900
been around for a long time come the end

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,480
of the 19

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,269
90s and it became increasingly apparent

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,689
to a lot of people that it was necessary

00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:23,329
to help corporations embrace free

00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:24,860
software and the only help that many

00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:27,260
corporations were getting in embracing

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,140
free software was having people show up

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,230
and shout at them for not doing free

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:36,560
software and telling them how unethical

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,870
they were and telling them how bad and

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,269
evil they were now the truth is that

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,799
corporations are indeed evil I mean

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:47,980
there's no doubt about it but let me

00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:50,659
tell you a story about this crocodile

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,400
see I've met this crocodile this

00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:56,480
crocodile is in a crocodile farm in

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,840
Australia and he gives a number of shows

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,909
each day he's actually got a friend this

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,470
guy here who looks a little bit like

00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:09,170
Steve Irwin he is he is not a soft guy

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,400
he is very happy to pick up Australian

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:16,069
snakes and wave them around and thus

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,040
they real snakes with real teeth and so

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:20,389
this guy gives shows with crocodiles and

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,160
when I say he gives flows with

00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:24,260
crocodiles I don't mean he points to

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,139
them in the tank I mean he gets in there

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,659
and gives Jose with crocodiles and these

00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:32,840
again are real crocodiles that really

00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:36,859
eat things so now he's he gives his show

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,690
in there and he shows you what a

00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:42,979
crocodile is like he shows you a pool of

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:46,340
water smaller that stage and he kind of

00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:49,159
it so calm and muddy and he he says

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,739
there's a crocodile in there and he then

00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,629
gets a kick in on a stick you know a

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,790
whole chicken on a piece of string on a

00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:58,609
stick and holds it over the pool and

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:02,269
taps the water with it and a crocodile

00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:03,829
comes up and he eats the chicken this is

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,699
just by way of proving that it's a real

00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:10,609
crocodile so at the end of the show that

00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:12,530
he does a QA as everyone does and you

00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:15,829
see he and the crocodile both do the Q&A

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,289
at the end of the show and somebody asks

00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,579
him whether he knows this crocodile you

00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,409
know whether he's got a relationship

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,659
with this crocodile whether working with

00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:25,730
him means they have an empathy and he

00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:29,480
says you know don't be stupid

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:32,480
ball it's a crocodile know it you don't

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,910
have empathy with crocodiles crocodiles

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,230
don't have a personality they are

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:42,320
reptiles there they respond to fear and

00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,210
they respond to hunger and if they're

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,680
afraid of something then they act and if

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,780
they are hungry they act and if they're

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,270
neither they sit and join in the Q&A

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:55,250
with the audience now you can see all

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,750
the time I did a close-up here you can

00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,210
see all the time he's doing this talk

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,630
that crocodile is sitting there running

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:05,780
a computation about how fast the guy can

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:11,240
run how much nutrition there is in the

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:13,460
foot it's going the whole time okay so

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,980
you should never believe if you're going

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,160
to deal with a crocodile that you can

00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,960
talk it round to your point of view cuz

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,500
honestly you can't it's a crocodile a

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,520
bloody reptile mate you can't talk it

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:31,190
round to your point of view so you know

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,290
if you are wanting to talk a cocktail

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,940
crocodile around what you actually need

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,060
is someone who looks a bit like Steve

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,070
Irwin suddenly who understands

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,040
crocodiles somebody who knows that you

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,260
don't talk ethics to crocodiles you

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,360
don't talk morality to crocodiles what

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:53,210
you do is you throw crocodiles chickens

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:56,390
and so this is where the open source

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,860
initiative came from the open source

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,230
initiative came from a deep

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,840
understanding by a group of very smart

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:06,350
people that corporations are reptiles

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:10,130
and that the value to them of software

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:12,530
freedom is not ethical the value to them

00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,260
of software freedom is to do with the

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,760
four freedoms that this is my paraphrase

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,520
of the four freedoms that makes it

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,640
simpler for people corporations need

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,330
those liberties they need the freedom to

00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,070
use study modify and distribute software

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,580
but they don't care that it's ethical

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,350
because they're they're reptiles

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,470
corporations don't have ethics people

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:39,560
have ethics what makes a corporation

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,960
ethical is the people in it behaving

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,850
quickly corporations just have processes

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,060
and budgets and bottom lines and

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,370
shareholders so we could see back in

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,250
1998 that if we were going to help

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,110
corporations embrace free software which

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,030
seemed to be a profoundly important

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,680
thing to do as Microsoft were in the

00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,910
process of killing off Netscape and

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,580
killing off the browser we were all

00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,919
using we felt that we had to come up

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,889
with a way of talking about it that

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,200
emphasized the pragmatic values rather

00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:12,650
than trying to talk morality to

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,550
crocodiles and so that is where OSI came

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:18,889
from in 1998 it was about pragmatic

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,460
software freedom to leverage corporate

00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:24,200
involvement it D emphasized the ethical

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,110
imperative but that didn't mean it

00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,540
wasn't there it meant that it wasn't

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,669
there was no point in talking about it

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,380
to the target audience because they

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,450
would just think that you are some kind

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:40,160
of crazy radical and stop listening to

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:42,770
you and so OSI focused on practicalities

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,660
it focused on education on educating

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,150
people about open source as a

00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,340
development methodology it focused on

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,660
licensing you focused on building

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:56,150
understanding and so in the last decade

00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,940
what our sign has done is it focused on

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,890
licensing it came up with the open

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,890
source definition a definition of what

00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,810
attributes are licensed had to have if

00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,210
it was going to deliver the Four

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,729
Freedoms to people who received software

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,919
under that licence that's what the open

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,760
source definition does it defines how a

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:19,010
license can deliver on software freedom

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,350
it was such a successful idea that we

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,850
had over 60 different people decide that

00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,160
they wanted to submit licenses for

00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,100
approval license proliferation was a

00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,110
unfortunate sign of success sometimes

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,570
when you succeed things happen that you

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,099
weren't anticipating and we ended up

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,839
with lots of licenses and so we spent

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,419
some time categorizing them and creating

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,880
a canonical listing of licenses if you

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,039
go to the OSI website today you'll find

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,720
a list of licenses and right at the top

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,300
or a set of licenses that it's a good

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,130
idea to use and down below the fold

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,839
there's a long list of licenses that

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,360
it's really not a very good idea to use

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,950
and most corporate folks

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,510
get the idea when they see the list that

00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,040
you should really only use the ones at

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:02,380
the top and there's not very many of

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:07,430
them so in the last decade OSI has

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:10,550
become the owner of a brand that is

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:13,490
incredibly powerful open source has

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,490
become the default for software in

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:19,220
particular OSI has become the standard

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,920
for open sourcing government governments

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,860
around the world use OS eyes list of

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,690
open source licenses as V benchmark for

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,800
whether software is open source or not

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:33,140
and that's led to a loss of fear the

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,209
fear of software freedom the fear of

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,329
free software has gradually diminished

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:40,040
it has become common thinking for

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,930
corporations to want open source

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,360
software to the point where the fud

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,480
making lawyers who say the GPL is

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,250
dangerous who's even a previous speaker

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,160
who is a passionate guy about the GPL

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,750
still goes around pretending the GPL is

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,100
dangerous it's not dangerous it's no

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,620
more dangerous than the Microsoft

00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,790
end-user license agreement Microsoft

00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,140
then user license agreement is more

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,990
dangerous actually because if you drop

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:06,890
it you can break your foot GPL isn't

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:09,769
that heavy so as a corporation the way

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,390
you manage the GPL is using the same

00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:15,790
process you manage all your other

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:18,470
licensing arrangements it's not hard so

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:21,140
fear has gone there is a certain

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:24,470
uniformity to open source and free

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:27,589
software usage and interestingly the

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,959
term is being used elsewhere I got an

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:31,339
email yesterday I subscribe to my Member

00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,140
of Parliament I don't know if you do i

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,940
subscribe to my member of parliament in

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,670
the UK using a system called they work

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,910
for you which I thoroughly recommend to

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:44,690
you so a free software project written

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,820
by some great activists at my society

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,529
and so I get an email every time my MP

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,230
stands up and talks in Parliament in the

00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:53,060
UK and one of the things he said

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,120
yesterday was he talked about how the

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,610
energy policy in the UK is being there

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,520
using a wiki to develop the energy

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:05,990
policy using an open-source policymaking

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,310
process now that term has become an

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,520
indicator of ink

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,470
cygnus it's become an indicator of

00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,730
citizen engagement it's become a

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:19,130
indication that there is no hidden

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,860
controlling entity and so the term open

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,480
source has succeeded wildly the market

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,600
has been established and open source is

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,370
the norm it would be tempting if I was

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,550
George Bush to find an aircraft carrier

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,410
and put a banner up on it now we've

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,330
things have changed though over the last

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,950
decade one of the things that's changed

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:42,500
is educated people have realized that

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:45,620
they can't leave the revolution to the

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,420
radicals and we've begun to see the

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,300
Occupy movement we've begun to see

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,970
people realizing that copyright

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,640
absolutism is a massive threat to our

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,320
liberty and culture and we've begun to

00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,830
see people realizing that they can't

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,480
trust politicians to do anything about

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,060
it they've got to stand up and start

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,339
talking about it they've discovered that

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:11,360
the government is run by lobbyists and

00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:13,790
that they don't have one and so they've

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,910
started being their own lobbyists so

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,500
this so this was the well the Occupy

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,089
champion San Francisco got moved on from

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,390
the park this was then walking up

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:24,830
through the center of san francisco

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,530
naturally they're all being protected by

00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,790
these police officers here there was a

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:32,240
very large number of police officers

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,490
protecting them I noticed from the huge

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,900
rabble of people with cameras curing and

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:40,310
supporting them so we're in a new decade

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,980
open source is the default digital

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,330
Liberty is moving to center stage

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,410
government by lobbyists needs

00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:50,660
challenging OSI was tired it was

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,970
irrelevant because everyone was now

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,190
using the term open source and no one

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,470
cared anymore I've been talking to

00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,450
people in this process of reforming is I

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,100
about joining in and one of the

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,230
organization's I spoke to said they

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,529
couldn't be bothered to join because OSI

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,000
was irrelevant which is a little ironic

00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,770
because what I was offering them was the

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,870
opportunity to change it into something

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:16,790
that wasn't irrelevant anymore so what

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,510
we have decided to do at OSI is to move

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:23,390
beyond licensing and to

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:27,080
turn OSI and the open-source brand over

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,970
to the people about time OSI has been

00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,780
run by a board of ten people for the

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,990
last 12 years active 14 years it's about

00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,400
time it became a member led organization

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,990
so we're going to reinvigorate it with

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,690
member-based governance now this is

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,030
interesting because we have to include

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,030
all the stakeholders in the process we

00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,320
really can't afford to exclude anybody

00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:52,270
so that means that we have to include

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,500
yes the obvious stakeholders open-source

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,900
organizations but we also have to

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,540
include government organizations and

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,510
government bodies we have to include

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:05,420
competency centers we have to include

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:07,730
corporations somehow and how do we do

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,520
that how do we work out how to include

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,380
all the stakeholders without the risk of

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,120
those stakeholders who typically have

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,010
got very well funded lobbyists as we

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,980
observed in the previous slide from

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:22,100
taking over the ship so the process that

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,340
we've decided on is to first of all get

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,830
a college of extremely trustworthy

00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,800
parties together to guide our size

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,550
governance so today I'm announcing that

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:39,740
OSI has got a new group of affiliates

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:42,320
who form the governance backbone of the

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,890
new OS I and I'm also announcing that

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,370
today we have an open call for nonprofit

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:54,200
organizations to affiliate with OSI so

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:55,970
if you are part of the leadership of an

00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,160
open-source organization and open source

00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:01,670
project I'd like to hear from you about

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,040
joining is I and our next stage is then

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,060
to get that College of wisdom that we

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,630
have created to help us form

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,830
organizations that can embrace

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,240
government entities so I hope we'll see

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,220
European government entities that are

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,110
doing open-source joining in and also

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,390
organizations that are a bit tricky to

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,850
including rules give you an example of

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,050
one of those oregon state university has

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,390
got an open-source lab which is

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,150
fantastic we all love them we all host

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:33,020
our projects there OSI hosts code there

00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:34,190
and the problem is that they aren't an

00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,170
entity they

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,630
adjust a project of Oregon State

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,340
University so how do we include them in

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,380
government in governance do we give the

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,350
the Chancellor of Oregon State

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,910
University a role in our governance or

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,530
do we give the people working on the

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,840
project involved in the governance but

00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,880
if we do what do our rules say about

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,890
them and about how they were identified

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,650
so we've got some difficult problems to

00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:02,480
solve but today I'm pleased to say we've

00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:04,790
got 12 organizations that certainly a

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,940
subset of those organizations we all

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,950
trust some of us may have questions

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,650
about some of them for one reason or

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:15,050
another but they are all a group of

00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:18,200
organizations that we can decide that we

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,030
do trust with open source and those 12

00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,300
organizations have agreed to form the

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,610
initial affiliates of OSI and starting

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,950
Monday will be helping us with making

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:31,280
governance decisions during mark they

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:33,590
will be selecting somebody to join the

00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,200
OSI board so that the OSI board will

00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,690
begin to be elected by members starting

00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,700
this month and going forward we

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,120
anticipate that the whole OSI board will

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,580
be elected by OS is membership then

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,340
during the second quarter we intend to

00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:53,000
launch a personal associate scheme to

00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:55,190
allow individuals to join OSI and those

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,870
personal associates will probably with

00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,360
the consent of the current affiliates be

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,400
able to elect a representative to the

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,770
board of directors and gain a set of

00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,360
benefits such as email addresses and a

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:09,439
big happy smile during third quarter we

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,800
anticipate that there will be some

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,680
corporate patrons joining those

00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,140
corporate patrons will probably not be

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,240
initially involved in governance but

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,220
once the organization is established we

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,949
anticipate that we may be able to let

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,530
those corporate associates also have a

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,720
seat on the board of directors the

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,540
majority of the directors will always be

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,510
elected by the affiliate membership that

00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:38,060
is the nonprofit college of open source

00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,760
projects when it comes to that personal

00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,800
associate scheme OSI needs your input oh

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,270
look my URL is gone from the bottom of

00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,350
the screen so you'll just have to note

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:50,860
down the long URL that's up there

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,570
we are we've created a survey to try and

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:57,760
understand what you would like to

00:17:52,570 --> 00:18:00,549
receive in the form of our membership so

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,830
please go to that URL complete the

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:05,169
survey and let us know what benefits you

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,870
want what membership fee is appropriate

00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:10,270
if any what rolling governance you would

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,010
like to have and other information that

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,910
will be fed into that process of

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:17,980
defining our size membership we are

00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:22,480
going to switch over to bottom-up

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:25,390
governance for the last 13 14 years OSI

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,210
has been a board only entity it's been

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:30,549
run by a group of directors who select

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,679
their successors there has been very

00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:36,780
little in the way of transparency and

00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:40,090
very little in the way of openness

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,220
paradoxically that was necessary in a

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,309
lot of ways it was the only way that the

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,289
founders of OSI could see to bring about

00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,350
the radical change that was needed to

00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:52,570
make OSI happen make open-source happen

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,419
everywhere but we don't need that

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,750
anymore everyone does open source so

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:01,840
everyone ought to get a say in what open

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,610
source means for the world so we're

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,320
going to be moving to a member led

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,960
governance where members will decide how

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,830
else I will operate where members will

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,740
create OS is initiatives we're launching

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,200
an initiative today which is on my next

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,970
slide as a sample of the work that we

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,580
think that the membership at OSI could

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,010
do we hope people will use OSI as a

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,740
policy venue we've been testing whether

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,890
OSI has a reputation with legislators

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,350
that is worth exploiting so last spring

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,270
I don't know if you heard but a group of

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,120
companies was trying to bind niveles

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:40,030
patent portfolio that group of companies

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,610
involved for companies that very few

00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,929
people in this room would trust even

00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:46,330
individually let alone as a group of

00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:49,390
four companies buying a mainly

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:52,900
open-source focused patent portfolio so

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:56,230
OS i wrote a position paper indicating

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,309
what a problem this was and OSI then got

00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,180
in touch with the Free Software

00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:02,770
Foundation and together o SI and FSF

00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,510
sent that position paper to the US

00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:09,190
government and to the German government

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:11,470
and we successfully led the those two

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,660
governments to review the veils patent

00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,400
portfolio in its acquisition and to set

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,520
terms that would prevent it being used

00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,740
against open source we found we were

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,970
able to do that remarkably quickly we

00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,640
were able to do with very little

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:28,360
question we had the authority to do that

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,980
oh SI and FSF together had the authority

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,990
in the eyes of the German and US

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,410
government's to raise questions about

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:37,800
open source and so we believe that that

00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:40,840
is a powerful position we believe that

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,600
software freedom that digital Liberty

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,310
has got a posse and we want to create a

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,190
venue where that Posse can come together

00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:50,260
and tell governments what is wrong with

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,440
their crazy policies around copyrights

00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,450
and patents so OSI will become a policy

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,730
voted policy venue where groups of

00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,830
people can create policy statements and

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,840
with the approval of the elected board

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,900
put them forward to governments and

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,180
institutions as the view of open source

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,920
the board will facilitate those actions

00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,480
with the lightest possible touch it will

00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,240
no longer be the only group doing the

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,840
work it will represent the members and

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,320
be elected by them and its main function

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,580
is to prevent regulatory capture

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,170
regulatory capture is where the

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,180
crocodile that you were trying to keep

00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:28,480
in the pen becomes the guy giving the

00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:31,180
show and we're also try and prevent

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,440
policy drift policy drift is something

00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,030
you see in quite a few open source

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,160
communities that have got a high level

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,930
of democracy it's where you have a

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,540
different policy each week depending on

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,010
who has the microphone we don't want

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,840
either of those things to happen so the

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,180
board is there to prevent regulatory

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,130
capture and to prevent policy drift but

00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,930
otherwise it's up to the membership to

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,180
do things so if you'd like to get

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,940
involved in that sort of thing now we've

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,680
created a project called the free libre

00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,460
and open source software body of

00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,830
knowledge the floss bach is intended to

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,780
be a resource for educators who are

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:08,860
creating a curriculum in higher

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,330
education teaching open source and we

00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,820
would very much welcome your involvement

00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:15,160
in creating that body of knowledge so

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,530
that we can have a formal academic body

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,510
knowledge that can raise the level of

00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,490
education about free libre and open

00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,830
source software it's announced today and

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:27,570
you can go get involved so our next

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:30,850
steps we are going to carry on with our

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:34,480
membership category creation it's likely

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:36,670
that come the end of 2012 will have such

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,670
a large administrative burden that we

00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:42,190
will need to have a very small assistant

00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,780
staff looking after membership so for

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,570
that we will probably need some funds

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,250
and we've been thinking hard about how

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,800
to raise a small amount of funding

00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,630
without the risk of giving control to

00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,030
the parties who would like to control us

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,590
see there are a few corporations who

00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,330
would be very pleased to give us all the

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,780
money we need to hire all the staff we

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,340
want the risk of doing that is they then

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,990
get to tell you that they'll then it

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,390
they'll stop giving you funds if you

00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,920
don't do what they ask and we're not

00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,380
willing to run the risk of that control

00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,760
so we want to spread the cost burden

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,280
over all of our membership categories

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,930
which is why there probably will be

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,210
membership fees for corporates and

00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:23,260
individuals and we'll be asking for

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:24,820
voluntary donations from affiliates now

00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,470
it's not set in stone yet though there's

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,890
still plenty of time to influence the

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:32,110
direction of that takes the full board

00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:35,110
has been put on notice that they have a

00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:38,980
term limited membership of the board so

00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:42,220
my term is I have another four years to

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,410
run on my board term we have board

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,370
members who are resigning or retiring

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:50,260
this year creating vacancies by 2015 we

00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,720
will have a ball that is fully elected

00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:55,300
by the membership and so by them we

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,520
expect to change the bylaws of OSI to

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:02,620
set in stone whatever the membership

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,660
events over the next two years when it

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,700
comes to dealing with crocodiles the

00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:10,930
best way to deal with crocodiles is with

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,400
trained staff by trained staff in the

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:16,330
world of open source what we really mean

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,280
is you your the people who probably have

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,380
or will have jobs in corporations

00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,050
corporations with no ethics and no

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,960
morals just with balance sheets and they

00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:28,630
will need you your heart your soul your

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,220
ethics and your morality to make them

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,800
act in a way that is further general

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,590
good and so therefore I believe that

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,300
it's very important that we make OSI

00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,670
into something strong we thought about

00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,110
killing it we thought about trying to

00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,450
doc its mission with some other

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:45,280
organization but we realized that the

00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:48,100
term open source and the list of

00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,590
licenses was actually had too much of a

00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,320
life for us to just kill it off so the

00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:55,630
alternative was to give it a purpose to

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,130
make something good out of it and so we

00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,800
want to turn all of you into crocodile

00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:03,760
trainers hopefully none of you will get

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:06,340
eaten in the process ask your project to

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,620
join OSI complete our survey there's the

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:11,200
short URL up there join in with floss

00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,090
bak ask me questions send me email

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,310
telling me that I'm crazy and that I'm

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:18,700
completely wrong so that I know before I

00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:21,340
make final decisions but please join in

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:25,120
because I believe that the the world

00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,770
needs a body of educated digital Liberty

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,380
activists who are passionate about

00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:33,220
software freedom and who are able to use

00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:37,140
corporations to make the world a free

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,140
digital place thank you very much

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,050
by my calculation I have three minutes

00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,840
left if you would like to ask a question

00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:51,150
there is a microphone there and there

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,060
and here please go to a microphone and

00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:56,990
ask your question otherwise I will stand

00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,990
and look attractive

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:25,929
so it had correct that Aussie doesn't

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:28,269
have the trademark for open source so

00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:30,190
the the question here is it correct that

00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:32,350
osa doesn't have the trademark for open

00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,620
source that's correct oh oh SI has the

00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:38,620
trademark for that green circle up there

00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:41,320
okay and what what our side does have is

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:43,750
as a result of 14 years of existence a

00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,120
moral authority around the term open

00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,159
source that means that when people want

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,409
to know what it means they tend to come

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,029
to OSI and so we found that without

00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,549
having the trademark we've still been

00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:56,769
able to cause people to cease and desist

00:26:54,549 --> 00:27:02,190
from abusing the term open source simply

00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:02,190
by growling at them thank you

00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,920
well I'm pleased that you find it good

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,240
to look at me looking looking attractive

00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,740
that's good thank you very much for

00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,850
listening and now the real speaker will

00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,850
