Thanks welcome everybody to our session

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,910
about working with contributor

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,940
communities my name is crystal vacati I

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:16,529
was asked to be here for the Fedora

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,900
project but then I recommended that York

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,189
will do the Fedora stuff and I'm going

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,500
to be your host today I'm completely be

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:29,220
us that's why I'm not going to say much

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,990
i'm just the moderator and i think we

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,930
should just kick off with a quick

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,210
introduction we have different people

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,820
here representing different projects and

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,879
each of them is supposed to introduce

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,270
their project within say three minutes

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,059
each or say five minutes but we really

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,879
need to hurry up because after that we

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,680
want to have a discussion say Iran table

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,199
where we discuss these things that work

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,870
well in the one or other project and the

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,550
things that don't so I think we should

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,050
just kick off with a brief introduction

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,090
all the people introduce themselves

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:08,640
quickly and then we get right into the

00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:12,030
into the distribution introductions all

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,340

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:22,790
mean ok I press the button so I'm going

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,959
to talk about the Ubuntu community for

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,150
those of you who don't know about us

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,400
we're quitting much blighted off

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,019
community at present we are full of loco

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,860
teams it's how the just the key when

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:35,480
she's broken up and so there are over a

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,280
hundred and fifty-two loco teams

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,690
worldwide that means every country or

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,100
every city in the states has a logo team

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,930
those two ways of doing communities for

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,489
us we did virtual way and real-life way

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:52,250
so the real life way for us is through

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:53,900
logo teams the logo team's main point

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,579
for their the whole purpose of is to do

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,130
advocacy translations bug trance

00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:00,260
triaging documentation or install fest

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,910
or global jams so they take part in

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,650
local events they organized their own

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,610
events or they take part in the greater

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,959
global community for the Ubuntu so this

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,760
is actually a community project that was

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,310
totally driven by us it's called loco de

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,680
bun to calm and on there is a purpose

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,360
resource four loko teams they can put

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
all their information the wiki contact

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,430
the website information forums and we

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,880
also put all of our events on to the

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,700
next page so as if there's over 140 150

00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:32,870
two teams worldwide this was developed

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:34,370
by Ubuntu loco team members um and this

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,750
was a feature that was added for us

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,940
because we want to put all their

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,970
resources on put one page so therefore I

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,620
was traveling to found so easily I could

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,620
look on the loco team page and see what

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,450
kind of events they're holding um we put

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,730
local team events on that we put

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,440
international events so we have an

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,109
international event call in a 12 hour

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,389
and many teams meet up once a month for

00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:58,340
an hour in a coffee shop just chatting

00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,850
about Ubuntu and it's quite nice and

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,260
it's verify

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,450
in very laid back it's different from

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,370
actually having a conference the next

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,470
slide there is another event we have

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,420
global gems we hold them twice a year in

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,160
between our release cycle just before

00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,050
the next release candidate we get

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,030
together we do translations bagh

00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,440
triaging and just taking part in

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,320
reporting bugs and getting people more

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,209
involved in the open to community and

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,610
excellent so yes that's what I actually

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,290
aims for and we basically then approve

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,940
them or unapproved teams they come

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,920
forward to the local council which I sit

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,810
on which is a board made up of six

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,750
people and we're elected for a two-year

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,480
term and this is my second term for

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,370
being elected to it and and we basically

00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,470
help and guide teams if they need

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,150
merchandise from canonical we have set

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,560
up that they can get a conference pack

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,110
if they're approved or unapproved they

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,670
get different gifts so we worked at

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,070
about two years ago was to get them a

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,510
gift a once-off gift from canonical that

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,760
when they're approved to get a banner

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,890
and a tablecloth which may not seem very

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,970
much but it makes some really kind of

00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,320
professional look if they're going to

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,250
conferences and taking part which is

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,360
quite nice and finally I think yes those

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,650
are just some links that I just thought

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,820
I put up that would help people if they

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,490
were looking for things later on and we

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,160
basically get local team members to

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,500
introduce the rest of their community

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,330
into the greater global community so we

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,820
have a woman to learning beginners teams

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,100
open days and user weeks where members

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,170
from the local teams take part maybe

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,020
give a session how to get involved in

00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,430
the community how to do bug

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,660
documentation or triaging and they

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,790
showed that to their members because all

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,410
our sessions are logged in IRC and then

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,300
we can send that link out to our members

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,400
and say this is what was taken part if

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,360
you couldn't make the IRC session and we

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,950
try and get people more and more

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,590
involved in the greater global community

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:48,190
and that's for me and I'll pass it on so

00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:48,190
you can see

00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:06,090
okay rich sort of the misfit tub so so a

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,610
cost analysis i said before i'm here to

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:12,150
talk about the ama susi ambassador

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:15,000
program our program is not as well as

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:19,320
developed as the other the other project

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,820
like boudoir fedora it's can you say

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,410
it's like the facts about the Ambassador

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,680
Program is that we have a hundred and

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:31,350
sixty-five ambassadors in 51 countries

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,080
we have a mailing list but most of our

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:38,100
ambassador issues are discussed in the

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,350
marketing in marketing meetings it's

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,510
pretty easy to become an open channel

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:47,310
master and that's something would like

00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:50,670
to fix nowadays also one of the bad

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,490
things fairly bad things that the

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,680
program has its say that unfortunately

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,650
many people nowadays use the Ambassador

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,860
Program another as a starting using that

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:05,820
as a starting point to enter the Amish

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,400
community if ghost the ghost of the

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:16,290
Ambassador Program the ghost of the

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:22,830
Ambassador Program is are very are not

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:25,800
very specific yet the current goals are

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,640
act as an evangelist aussie open suse

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,270
project to the public and may and

00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,970
actually you don't have to be an

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:36,930
ambassador to do that a mentor new users

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:41,340
to vitos support advances a local events

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,620
a promote open suse and contribution to

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,460
the Avensis project also having a lot of

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:50,160
fun nowadays me along with Richard Brown

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,990
are working in reconstructing the

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,230
master's program since we believe that

00:07:51,990 --> 00:08:01,350
we have we can make great improvements

00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:02,139
and make sorry Tomas Kofi and make this

00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,979
a better project

00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:08,949
so that people actually contribute more

00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:12,310
than having getting a title of being an

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:15,129
ambassador and then actually do one or

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,319
two things every year we want to make

00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:19,680
that master program starting point for

00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,770
people that I actually want to work and

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:46,329
want to attract contributors to the

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:48,040
advances project ok so Debian community

00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:49,570
in terms of developers in terms of

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,490
official project members is very large

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,290
and very scattered around the world so

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,550
we are about 1,000 developers which

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,649
which can be found all over the world

00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,079
mostly in Europe in the United States

00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:02,260
developing in South South Africa in Asia

00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,380
in Australia but on the other end the we

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,579
don't have a real structure for

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,160
gathering and to foster in the creation

00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:11,709
of local groups in specific part of the

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,660
world so next please so the current

00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,220
structure is that we have a lot of

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,199
mailing list which are used by local

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,899
communities to work on specific topics

00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:21,760
so for instance we have a user

00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,589
discussion list in specific languages

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,779
like debian france or they've in italian

00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:28,510
or debian german and those are contact

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:31,180
points for users to have a beautiful

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:34,510
place where to discuss issues or there

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,459
or they there so what they are doing

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,440
with debian this is most a user focused

00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,880
then we have also a plenty of developer

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,180
mailing list in specific languages and

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,470
thus it helps for people who won't want

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,990
to approach they've been development but

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,339
maybe are not that familiar with English

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,019
we also have a lot of translation

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,899
activities which goes on on mailing list

00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:54,279
so we have the Debian lt10 and set of

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,050
mailing list which are mostly used to

00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,610
work on the translation of Debian

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,490
specific content in several languages

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,860
and we have a quite new activity which

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,660
is meant to offer mailing list for local

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,399
groups but it's very new so we just have

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,040
like three mailing list for local

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,990
meetings on the world then we have

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,630
something which is a rather a dock so on

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,120
the wiki some users started to

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,100
flock together and create local contact

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,230
points on the world there is essentially

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,090
a wiki page where you local groups can

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,610
declare themselves and point to their

00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,950
specific resources and we have on

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,720
completely different level what we call

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,370
Debbie untasted organization so debian

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,350
as a project is not backed by any

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,180
specific company so we have the need to

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,700
have associations around the world which

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,830
all our assets and we have them on the

00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,960
word but it is not true some are used to

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:44,830
promote debian but most of them exist

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,330
only to to hold the DNS assets so we

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,220
have quite some issues with this

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,440
structure so first of all is too much a

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,720
doc so there is no real structure that

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,120
at first of all advertised the

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,190
possibility of creating a local debian

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,700
group in your area and there is no

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:02,170
incentive so people start up creating a

00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,880
local group do that just because they

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,470
love that bit but there is no way for

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,990
the project to actually give encourage

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,750
them to do so and as a consequence of

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,790
that while Debian developers have are

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,190
all around the world the local debian

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,540
groups are very very little not covering

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,190
the whole world so there are plenty of

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,890
places where you will not be able to

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,570
find a local debian interest or so this

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,310
is the first problem and the second one

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,350
is that we are scattering your sources

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,050
so a lot of groups what they are doing

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,940
are creating their non official website

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,590
and fan site for Debian there an

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,990
official forum there an official wiki

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,340
there an office on IRC channel and we

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,080
have the impression that doing this we

00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,980
are actually wasting some of the efforts

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:44,110
in the community next please so we want

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,000
to fix this so I must say I'm here

00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,550
mostly to learn from other project which

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,110
are more developed structure for local

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,390
groups but what I want to share with you

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:56,140
is the big ol we're setting our self for

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:58,630
this initiative so for us the first goal

00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,570
is to actually to sing so encourage

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,710
groups to form spontaneously so let's

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,360
say we have people who are enthusiastic

00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,160
about the man I would are on the water

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,960
we want them to know that they are

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,300
welcome to create a local group in their

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,920
area and then also to add some

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,570
mechanisms to keep alive those groups

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,070
because it's fairly easy that groups

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,800
creates and then the interest of the

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,810
main driving person fade away and so we

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,510
want them to keep them alive I want to

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,800
find the right incentive to do so and

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,630
what are the goal of the group's for us

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,950
so first of all reduce the gap among

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,690
users and developers

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,820
so there is a sort of charge among a

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,800
simple user and developers and it's

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,930
really difficult to pass from a user a

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,940
developer and we believe that local

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,910
groups that can meet face to face can be

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,810
a good way to make it easier to cross

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,250
this chasm from users to developers and

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,380
also we want to ensure some debian

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,990
present presence at local events and we

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,730
want a place a directory where it's easy

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,960
to find an answer to the question ok i'm

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,940
interested in debian and they live in

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,800
this specific area who should i contact

00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,810
if i want to work with people on that

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,610
then if I want to organize the main

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,650
event in the tiger this question is a

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,300
question that people often pauses to me

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,830
as the main project leader and they

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,990
often don't know how to answer so this

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,460
is the things we want to fix and the

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,020
third problem would like to solve with

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,060
the Morgan and structure is to actually

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,650
have some mechanisms to avoid conflict

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,480
so for instance we want to avoid

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,890
situation in which for a specific area

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,380
of the world a specific counter or

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,340
specific region for very big counters we

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,200
want to avoid that there are two

00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,360
competing groups saying okay I want to

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,160
be d local debian groves so who is

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,990
winning so we want to avoid this kind of

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,300
long conflicts but if they will ever

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,800
arise we want to have a light governance

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:41,980
model that I'll pass in fixing that

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:52,120
thanks stuff but tomorrow tee what makes

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:57,440
your project special ok true the PDF at

00:13:52,120 --> 00:14:01,550
the left ok

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,310
um we are fairly fairly new project

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,620
though though so the situation as we

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,380
don't have a real local community team

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,530
yet it's something that just has to be

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,630
established next place but we do have

00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,990
quite a lot local communities in several

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:20,330
countries pretty please so the biggest

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,430
ones are in France and Germany France as

00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,790
the country most of my gear people come

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:28,250
from and Germany is our second

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:30,830
stronghold but there are also grouped in

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,350
Poland Greece Italy Spain and Brazil I

00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,690
don't know about the United States or

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:39,830
Australia or Canada something like that

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:42,560
so our main goal is to get organized and

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,930
so my main goal here is to see what

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,460
others do and how they do it to learn

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:52,490
from them okay so little thing about

00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,730
mogera and how those local community

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:59,420
teams will be fitting into our overall

00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:01,190
structure so we have two bodies the one

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:06,320
is the Association doing all the legal

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:08,420
stuff holding the assets to taking

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,240
donations and things like that and the

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,310
other one is the megillah project or the

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,620
council leading it and the council is

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,220
made up of representatives of each team

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,740
so translators developers packages

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:25,970
artwork marketing whatsoever and a local

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:29,210
community team would fit in to the left

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,580
section so the local community team

00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,130
would have the same voice as a package a

00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:40,160
team or as an internationalization team

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:43,520
and so on ok now as I just said we are

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,170
organized in teams and every team has

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,960
the same voice every team has one

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,240
representative in Council and the

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:55,370
council is the body that is actually

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:59,060
doing the decisions ok just said that ok

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,280
that is a the point that is rather

00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,520
important to us we don't want to have

00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,620
only the technical people ruling the

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,380
McCabe project we want to have everyone

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,540
who is contributing having the same

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,200
voice and approach

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:19,510
that's why we decided not to leave any

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:21,760
team out as soon as it forms up and so a

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,480
local community team would have the same

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:29,980
voice as every other team as well and

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:33,040
our idea is to create a team that

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,230
actually represents all those local

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,210
communities we have so each local

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:42,970
community can send can elect a leader

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:48,220
which that I normally do have and those

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:50,290
leaders will select a representative who

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,710
will represent all the teams in the

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,180
council if this works I don't know we

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,990
have to check we have to see it's

00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,960
something we will try to do this year to

00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:05,440
get an overview of what we have because

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,650
up to now we mostly know about what the

00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,970
French and the German the Italian and

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:16,600
the Spanish groups do we don't really

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:20,170
know what groups in greece and in poland

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,930
and in brazil do and we want to change

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:25,900
that not to tell them you have to do

00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:28,270
this a lot but just to be informed and

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,030
to be to have a central point where the

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:34,630
teams can ask for help if they need it

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:37,990
thanks all right thank you you I don't

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:40,360
have any slides but I can just talk mmm

00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,640
originally Donnie burgers was supposed

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,860
to be here by then in the end I guess my

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,500
name in it ended up there but from Jeju

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,890
we have like 200 alpers we don't have

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,960
any local stuff so there's a good

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,190
question at what point in the size of

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,200
the organization you want to start

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,720
splitting up to local things but in

00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,070
gentoo everyone can those who do

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,720
translations and things there oh it's

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:06,340
all big group of 200 people so but so

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,200
far it's worked fine and every kind

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,150
everyone can start new projects under

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:15,790
Gen 2 so from summer ones to form a

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:18,190
local team Lee they could do it but as

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:21,510
far as backing cozy there's like debian

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:24,240
these there's a very little money to go

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:27,720
much less money to go around

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,510
I bein the foundation why so as a

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,720
foreign contrastive canonical there's

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:38,550
fewer opportunities by stuff around the

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:43,500
world and she be there so thanks thank

00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:45,179
you I don't don't really know why

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,280
Christophe chose me because my English

00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,830
is very bad so I'm sorry because it

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,710
fills up the whole project that's why

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:55,650
you were chosen okay the Fedora

00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:00,480
ambassadors are yeah just a small subset

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:03,720
of the around 25,000 fedora account

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,820
holders but i think it's represents the

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,720
project very good because from all the

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,490
groups like packagers artwork marketing

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,130
translation they are also ambassadors

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,190
and they can chain can join this group

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:21,540
and yeah just is the ideal role model

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:26,550
that we would have in an ideal world so

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:31,140
we don't see ambassadors not only as ya

00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:35,760
doing events or doing some marketing we

00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:37,380
are also want them to doing HR so find

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,890
the right contributor for the right task

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:45,300
is really important and yeah to have

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:47,760
some people who get recognized oh this

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:51,480
is the guy from fedora so give them a

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,120
face and a name and of course they

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,150
should have some work in the Fedora

00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,120
project so they are not only ambassadors

00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:02,309
they should be yeah doing some stuff as

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:06,380
example I do the Fedora security lab

00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:09,300
beside my work as the Fedora ambassador

00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:13,200
yeah we are organized with a steering

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:16,350
committee which is elected by the Fedora

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,410
ambassadors Christophe I do not know if

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:22,620
you try to change that so the whole

00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:25,080
project will it elected it will it will

00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:28,980
be continued to be elected I think okay

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,900
I'm a chair of the Fram scope so then we

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,530
have the embezzler membership

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,760
administration who is doing all the

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,860
administration stuff but also develops

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,000
the mentoring process

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:45,840
and we have around 12 mentors around the

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,600
world who are ya mentor new candidates

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,210
and decide if he's ready to become an

00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,940
ambassador and yeah and then we have the

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:57,299
regular leadership yeah it's not really

00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,620
teams it's more informal leaders so we

00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:06,150
have credit card holders who can pay for

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:11,700
their local community yeah right now we

00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:14,970
are 500 500 ambassadors but there are

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:20,940
some inactive accounts in this number so

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:27,390
I think we are 540 so you see also we

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:31,130
develop since 2005 and we were more than

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:35,400
800 people but we make some clean ups

00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:40,350
every three years so we clean up the

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:42,360
inactive accounts and yeah yeah this is

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:46,200
a number we start since we started with

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:52,500
the mentoring program um we got I need a

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:55,610
I need classes we had 1600 nearly 1600

00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:02,160
membership requests and from this

00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:05,850
request only 295 right this is a 295

00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:08,880
yeah this is deeds were sponsored yes

00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:12,660
and these were not yeah and these are

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,419
makers little annoying issues yes and on

00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:19,860
the on the right side you see the yellow

00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:25,230
line is so we sponsor 10 visitors every

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:31,530
month so this just some slides how we

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:36,840
developed how it started in 2006 yeah we

00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:40,130
became uniforms in 2008 and Yap and now

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:45,270
we are very large good to develop

00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:49,320
community and maybe some numbers also to

00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:50,659
the events so we are doing 183 events in

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,899
2010 and

00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:55,999
you can see how it growed and then you

00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:58,940
see the budget we have a budget around

00:22:55,999 --> 00:23:01,009
one hundred thousand dollars per year to

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,039
making events and here's the

00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:07,999
distribution of events and present for

00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:10,549
the budget and what events we or how

00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:14,389
much events we do with a budget and how

00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:20,269
its spread it around apec amia that time

00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:22,249
and north america that's it okay thanks

00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:25,479
everybody I think that was enough to

00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:29,419
give you a brief idea of the different

00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:31,759
projects we have I wouldn't i would like

00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:34,369
to have an open discussion about what

00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,619
makes this project different i mean from

00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:38,779
the fedora point of view with my fedora

00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:40,489
hat on i can say one thing that makes

00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:43,099
the Fedora ambassador program very

00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:45,470
special as the strict mentoring only one

00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:47,859
out of four makes it to become an

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,440
ambassador I'm not sure if other

00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:53,769
distributions have anything like that

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:58,509
you just take everybody or do you just

00:23:53,769 --> 00:24:04,669
how many candidates apply every month or

00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:06,499
it work right so open to is a bit

00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:09,049
different that way we have ubuntu loco

00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:12,070
teams and we have ubuntu membership so

00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:15,019
at the moment we have over 700 members

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,759
worldwide and those have gone through a

00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,970
process but they've gone to an interview

00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:23,239
panel on IRC either through Europe

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:25,190
Americas or Asia and those are open to

00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:27,320
members but anybody can be involved in

00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:29,869
loco teams you don't have to be an open

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,909
to member I'm with regards to mentoring

00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:34,070
different groups so documentation

00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,779
translations it went to women all have

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,349
their own mentoring project so it's

00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:41,149
different that way the local teams are

00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:42,979
just the local communities it's not that

00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:46,009
you have a dedicated project who are

00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:49,070
just doing spread the word who are going

00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:51,049
outside like I mean so again local teams

00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,460
they they have to remain active and

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,139
they're more than a log they have to

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,349
prove that they're promoting a bun to

00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:59,929
and only a bun to but some 12 teams are

00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:01,950
do interact with other community so I do

00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:03,840
know the Italian loco

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,130
operates really well with the Debian

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,899
community and they hold a lot of joint

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,340
conferences so that's a great resource

00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:11,190
to have both communities joining

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:13,080
together but mostly like a local team

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:16,500
would work on their own translations for

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,330
their team so French German translations

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,610
they do great work there and they kind

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,380
of Mentor one another and sometimes if

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,029
we're fortunate enough they grow their

00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,860
community up to the larger governance so

00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:27,419
like I'm from Ireland but I also said on

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,190
the community council the local council

00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:32,760
and the membership board in Europe and

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:34,590
if we / get more involved so related to

00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,279
that I wonder which kind of mechanism

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:40,200
are you people using in general to use

00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:42,269
to verify if people are still active so

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,220
what we have seen that your numbers go

00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:46,320
down because I guess some point you

00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,350
check if people are active anymore and I

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,760
guess you have something similar so and

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,730
I'm sorry to see if you try a different

00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,830
solution which one works best for you I

00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,889
can say this for fedora I mean we had

00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,880
this in the past people were not really

00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:01,559
active on the mailing list and

00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,179
somebody's then said please reply to

00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,190
this mail if you are still alive and

00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:08,730
kicking and suddenly they all showed up

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,500
again and that was endless threads on

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,389
the mailing list there must know yes I'm

00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,070
still alive I am still here I still work

00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:15,840
for fedora know you don't but anyway

00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,330
people were arguing and we were arguing

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,909
about introducing the stages of an

00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,980
inactive ambassador so I say I have to

00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:25,110
work for university or something I mean

00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,779
you can become inactive we don't throw

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:30,000
you out of the project that meanwhile we

00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,860
have say a natural cleaning up mechanism

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,139
because you have to change your ssh keys

00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:37,260
and your passwords like every six months

00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:39,600
or something or we had a major we had a

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,549
we have exchanged all as its H key in

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,380
the federal account system and people

00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:45,720
who are given time like three months to

00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,929
do this and if you haven't changed your

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:52,289
password after three months well then

00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:53,519
you are no longer the accounts are still

00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:55,470
in the account system but they are

00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,360
suspended they can reactivate them at

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,269
any time if they decide to come back but

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,029
they are inactive in the account system

00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:06,000
and therefore their membership is it's

00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:08,220
not come to an end but it's yeah we

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,929
don't have nothing like this actually

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,399
everybody can become an ambassador and

00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:13,920
open suse and that's a problem and

00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:16,110
that's a why we're now

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,860
adding the Ambassador Program because we

00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:24,930
have 165 ambassadors and we have less

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:26,730
than fifty percent active many people

00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,920
become ambassadors and then forget that

00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:32,340
they had they are just the name in the

00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,590
list so also this course discusses

00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,380
people that I are actually active in the

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:41,490
project and can lead and lead local

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:43,530
teams and lead tries turns if they have

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,390
translators around them and make great

00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:48,270
work and not becoming an ambassador

00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:51,600
because many people think that being an

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:54,150
ambassador is like nothing and now that

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,480
is why we were trying to reconstruct the

00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:58,920
whole idea because anyway when the

00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:04,350
Ambassador Program is going to associate

00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:07,140
pastor program started it was it they

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:10,440
didn't give it any thought they said I

00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:11,880
in my mind as a they thought oh I fedora

00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,340
have a muscle program let's make an

00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,280
ambassador program ourselves but nobody

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:19,320
can deny someone to become I'm a member

00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,750
of the Ambassador welcome Tim Robbins to

00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,400
see and we cannot actually deny someone

00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,000
to become an ambassador so practically

00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:29,730
everybody can do that and that causes

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,670
problems we hope in the next month's we

00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:36,150
change all that we're writing that so

00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:38,280
okay I'm see you just a touch back on uh

00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:40,080
um so again because the wouldn't you has

00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,180
grown and we did we start off I mean

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,680
putting all our events on wiki pages and

00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,540
all our teams on wiki pages and through

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,010
governance and kind of people wanting

00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,810
any more and more involved we have ended

00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,730
up with loca that are going to come com

00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,050
which is our loco team portal you know

00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,150
we have started off small and we have

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:56,220
grown and it's not perfect we're still

00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:58,800
tweaking it with regards to membership

00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,000
again to becoming a member you have to

00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,890
go through a process and go through an

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,600
application board but you get a

00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,250
notification every two years to renew

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,280
your membership and if not your expired

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,630
so that's one way of cleaning up when

00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,940
you become a November you get an IRC

00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,080
cloak and the RSC Council at the moment

00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,570
of doing a spring cleaning of all the

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,090
cloaks that have expired so we do do try

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,440
and keep it as updated as possible but

00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:23,580
throughout those ways and listen we are

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,380
planet up into gets updated as well the

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,030
default mechanism is you need to declare

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,810
explicitly if you are active otherwise

00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,550
you are x

00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:31,550
fire after some time fire two years in

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:42,720
what's what's the link between

00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:47,630
membership and local teams then so um

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,650
anybody in the world can be a part of an

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,060
abundant in Portal you can see if

00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,860
there's a community nearby and you can

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,170
take part and join their mailing list

00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,810
and just join the IRC channel or forms

00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,670
to becoming a 12 member you have to show

00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,650
sustained activity in the Ubuntu

00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,410
community so if that is through advocacy

00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,880
I'm not a developer I don't code but I

00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,010
do through advocacy and I get people

00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,480
involved in organized events and I try

00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:12,240
as much as a possibly can to promote

00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,600
ubuntu on my machine or giving a talks

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,130
or honey oat cds and different people do

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,660
different things to warrant membership

00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,830
and we put them through different to

00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,870
different ways we through through like

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,000
say maybe advocacy and non-development

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,130
ways and we also go through developer

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,660
way so mo to the developer membership

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,760
board so there's two different ways of

00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,830
getting membership in a bun too and

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,420
those are but anybody can be part of a

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,280
local team we don't turn anybody away

00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,320
there's also a generic mailing list

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,820
called loco teams and anybody can join

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:43,440
it and just listened with a low traffic

00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:45,600
mailing list ok any milk I would

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,910
continue with questions that show are if

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,160
you have any questions I think first and

00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:56,490
then we continue with questions from the

00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:59,130
audience how much importance do you

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:02,100
think it has a the financial background

00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:09,030
of its distribution to the development

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:11,130
of local or general the communities so

00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,960
when I just State for clarification

00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:16,080
canonical doesn't give loco teams any

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,330
money um any loco team operates on their

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,670
own way of fundraising so I do know that

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,470
the Belgium loco may have sell some

00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,210
stuff this weekend that raise money for

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,330
their team to buy CDs for the next event

00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,370
um in Ireland we got pins for our

00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,410
t-shirts we sold them at two euros

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:33,750
that's money for our next event we don't

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,970
get any financial money from canonical

00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:38,780
for a bun to the only thing we do get is

00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,780
CDs um

00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:49,299
yes but that's our canonical yes but

00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:50,350
we're saying from the head um the lady

00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:53,230
was just kind of find that the Brazilian

00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:56,620
loco has money but what I'm saying is

00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:59,110
canonical doesn't give us yes if I may

00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,490
so they've been is possibly like in

00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,500
terms of donation because it's a quite

00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,720
visible project so we do get quite a

00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,429
fair amount of money donated to us but i

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,340
would say that in terms of creating the

00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:11,200
community money are not very useful so

00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,470
it might be useful to promote stuff and

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,179
the biggest difference i see between a

00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:19,090
non-profit standpoint like debian and

00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:21,100
for profits and points that we we will

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,590
not for instance give things for free at

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,720
booth so at best we give them at a price

00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:27,700
of the core of the production cost but

00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,960
in the end in terms of the effective

00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,090
nevada promotion i don't think that

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:37,059
specific parts changed significant is a

00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:39,039
how it does is this helpful in order to

00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:41,650
evolve a community to make a better

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,179
community or do you think that this is

00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:47,320
not one of the things that you actually

00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:49,659
need well as a kind of new community

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,230
project without very much funding I

00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:56,289
think you can grow a rather good

00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:59,940
community without any money and getting

00:32:56,289 --> 00:33:04,659
the money along the way by donations I

00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:07,750
think if you don't have any financial

00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:10,720
background you will only have the people

00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:13,000
who are really into the project because

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,409
they have to pay for everything out of

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,750
their own account while if you say okay

00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:22,630
we can pay you your travel expenses or

00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:25,020
something like that you will have more

00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:30,510
people who are going for an event but

00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,510
perhaps not better quality of people

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,519
as far as money goes it for example a

00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,669
lot of observers their students involved

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,589
and so for them paying at their own

00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:44,179
expense you get get better quality

00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:48,799
people if you're sponsoring students

00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:51,649
like that I think it's really important

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,320
to help people to travel to events to

00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:57,009
meet there or make activity days to get

00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,709
something done and I want to ask the

00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:06,099
Voodoo lady sorry I forgot your name

00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:09,470
okay if you raise money from selling

00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:14,569
someone to stuff do you have an NPO for

00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:16,220
that or yeah the question is about a

00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:17,960
legal entity because we have that a

00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,020
problem in that are we don't have a

00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,510
legal entity that's why we cannot sell

00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:27,230
schwag or something because we are not a

00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:28,909
lot of money um some loko teams have set

00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,849
up organizations because they have to

00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:33,409
have a bank account I know an ardent all

00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:35,089
we did was it was small it was maybe we

00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:36,859
had about six years maybe eight years at

00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:38,480
a time I would use I made for a global

00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:40,539
jam to get some pieces and some food

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,129
afterwards it's not that extravagant

00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:45,409
other teams have become very much

00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:47,990
organized they've had chairs Treasuries

00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,250
bank accounts signatures and that gets

00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,929
an awful lot bureaucratic to be honest

00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,029
for me I don't find it any useful but

00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:54,470
for them for their country if they need

00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:57,170
to raise money they have to do it that

00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,400
way for the local council we can tell

00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,660
them they can't do it that way because

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,549
they want to raise funds for their

00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,920
community and that's how they need to do

00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:05,930
it so again every team logo team does

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,690
things differently in their community to

00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,760
a certain degree if I can give a

00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,920
suggestion on there so on that so debian

00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,390
as legal entity actually and full of

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,339
them yesterday there have been a

00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:18,950
wonderful legal issue track here at foss

00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:20,720
them in which was a talk about specific

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,549
at this point on nonprofits organization

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,349
which outfit software project there are

00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:26,390
plenty of them that are happy to accept

00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:28,640
other projects and the talks have been

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,380
recorded it will be available on the

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,660
podcast run by broderick own and current

00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,220
center so there are a lot of before

00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,839
starting your own association look

00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,890
around there are plenty of organization

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,240
already able to do that fairly

00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:44,119
efficiently failure but the point I just

00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,770
heard this morning from one of ugly guys

00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:51,890
that for example in Greece there is a

00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:54,319
Linux Association there and they're only

00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:57,049
reason of existence is to be the legal

00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:59,329
entity for all the linux user groups

00:35:57,049 --> 00:36:02,180
there are increase so there is one

00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:05,539
organization that does all the legal

00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,190
work for all the rest so not every

00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:14,599
project does have to create its own

00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:18,859
legal entity I think it's it's good to

00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:22,270
have a legal entity on top of the the

00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:27,319
overall organization like Fedora has

00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:31,579
with with the Fedora itself a legal

00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:33,890
entity right back so the federal

00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:37,670
trademark is owned by redhead and so

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:42,890
right it is the main sponsor for oh yeah

00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:46,490
for fedora and as I said before we have

00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:49,220
to go all through the processes in

00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:52,599
redhead so if we want to spend money we

00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:55,910
spend redhead money and we have to file

00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:59,180
budget reports and that's often very

00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:03,529
bureaucratic and if you went to we had a

00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:08,180
little legal entity I think gay old one

00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:10,759
was it closed down two years ago we had

00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:15,950
to close down the German legal entity or

00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:18,730
yeah fedora Mia and now the process is

00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:23,240
to get money or not the shortest way so

00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:26,359
some well it we didn't have to close it

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,430
down but the redhead the the I mean

00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:31,130
redditch is an American country they

00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:33,799
need to protect that trademark very

00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,059
aggressively even if they protect it

00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:37,549
against their own people basically

00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:39,770
against their own community and we were

00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:41,839
given the choice either you rename your

00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:44,990
foundation to something generic not with

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,509
the Fedora name in it or you won't get

00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:50,210
any money any longer from us and that's

00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:52,700
why we cancelled cancer deaths and I

00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:56,780
think this brings up another interesting

00:37:52,700 --> 00:38:00,050
question mainly for from aa gaya aur

00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,300
12 as well what is the relation to your

00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:04,850
commercial sponsor I mean the relations

00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:08,000
between mandria Vera in Maggie's not the

00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:11,180
best we all know that ok let's first say

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,820
that there isn't any relation between

00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:18,950
Marissa and Miguel market you told us

00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:21,020
yesterday about some things but you just

00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:27,620
were not specific at all you just had a

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:31,880
few ideas so weak yes ok we can find

00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:35,810
private magana is a project but did fork

00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,780
for mentor Eva and in September 2010 and

00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:40,670
we are a purely community-driven project

00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:43,610
we don't have any commercial background

00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:46,250
we don't have any company we live only

00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:49,760
by donations forget so there isn't any

00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:56,900
sponsor so if anybody has a few euro

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:58,370
left by our stand and so again we are a

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,020
separate entity to canonical the only

00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,660
backing we get and support we get is

00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,420
through CDs or conference pack so if a

00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,360
team is organizing a conference be them

00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,980
are approved team or an unapproved team

00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,810
they get a conference back from

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,270
canonical and that could be a case of

00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,430
cds lanyard some stickers what that team

00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:18,170
does with them if they want to sell them

00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:20,540
for a year or two euros each that's up

00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,770
to the loco team and as me personally I

00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,120
think that's a good idea because the

00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,060
team that has a little bit of extra cash

00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,190
if they want to have maybe some pieces

00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,470
or supply some t-shirts or to buy the

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,240
next lot of CDs to burn cds that's fine

00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,380
with that to be honest I be just

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,610
received any more comments from the

00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:42,590
audience yes on local teams specifically

00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:45,100
logo things now I'd like to know what

00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:47,540
you believe does not work well at all

00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,190
because pretty much everyone has been

00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,290
selling the good sides I think we can

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,540
rather learn from mistakes and bad

00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:55,520
experiences in the past well if it are

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,500
definitely it's the budget thing that

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,330
does not work good and the then the

00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,520
trademark thing that is definitely the

00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:03,980
biggest issue we get money from redhead

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,830
but it's a lot of bureaucracy and that's

00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,720
why the the relationship or overall the

00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,890
relationship between the commercial

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,780
redhead side and the

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:15,740
the contributors the community

00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:18,800
contributors is it's a we both need each

00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,390
other but sometimes it's a little hard

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,400
to work together that's the crucial

00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,190
thing it's going it's going to become

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,650
better because it's mixing many redhead

00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:29,930
employees even get engaged in fedora in

00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,700
the free time and so things are getting

00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,910
better but there's still a work that

00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:37,640
needs to be fixed and I'm yeah we did

00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:39,680
the legal stuff is boring I know but it

00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:48,920
needs to be done and we need to work on

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:51,550
that no York the question was whether

00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,560
one of us works for redhead no we don't

00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:57,350
jerk is allowed York has a credit card

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,510
from redhead and he had to sign a lot of

00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:01,460
paperwork and he gets to you need to

00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:03,800
file budget reports and he needs to know

00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,720
oh the dinner is booked on this cost

00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,240
center or nessus booked on that cost

00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,790
center so this is a lot of paperwork and

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,970
this really sucks so this needs to be

00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:15,050
improved just a comment on that I so we

00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,280
are not commercial at all we are a

00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,800
complete independent organization in

00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,990
Devon but that does not relieve people

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,490
from filing a receipt so this kind of

00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,470
stuff in fact I believe that if you

00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:26,540
spend money that are donated to us you

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,800
need to be even more clear on being sure

00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,510
that there are receives and all this

00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,330
kind of stuff so of course it's not like

00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:34,190
we have budget reports but still people

00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:35,780
will be reversed only if they ever seen

00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,630
this kind of stuff because the white do

00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,220
is to waste the money that people donate

00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,080
it to you but for example the money you

00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,510
raised at this event you sell all these

00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,100
t-shirts and stuff where does it go do

00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,900
you have a bank account who is the bank

00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,370
account holder do you have a legally for

00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,870
that as I briefly mentioned we have

00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:53,150
various organizations around the world

00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,890
mainly because if you have only one in a

00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,300
specific counter then you need to do

00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,700
money conversion and the kind of stuff

00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,740
so we have them in Constitution as an

00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,350
ocean of Debian trusted organization

00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:05,810
which our organization which are which

00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:08,240
we trust okay and we can update the list

00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,620
saying okay we trust you also and or you

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,050
don't we don't trust you anymore and

00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,600
this organization our legal entity which

00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,190
can all assets that exist in the real in

00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,410
let's say in the legal world like money

00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,880
like usually there are nonprofit

00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,370
organization like trademarks and this

00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,269
kind of stuff and usually they respond

00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,709
to what the

00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:26,749
I'll just usually by the mean of the

00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:29,390
demon prosecutor asked them to do so

00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:30,829
when there is our embracement to do the

00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,329
devon prosecutor approved it and then

00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:40,269
these organization proceed and do the

00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:42,949
umber sman okay directly sorry yeah

00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:46,269
often reimbursement doesn't work for

00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:50,359
poor countries we have Indian people who

00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:53,659
want to have at our conferences or our

00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:55,939
developer meetings and they cannot

00:42:53,659 --> 00:42:58,189
afford to prepay something so we have to

00:42:55,939 --> 00:43:00,919
pay for them and I think the credit

00:42:58,189 --> 00:43:04,489
cards besides all the paperwork is it is

00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:10,999
an improvement compared to the situation

00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:13,009
that we had we are years before just to

00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:14,089
get back onto Pascal's question so

00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:17,239
things that work and things that don't

00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:19,249
work about four years ago the local

00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:20,749
council didn't exist it was just the

00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:22,999
community council operated all of the

00:43:20,749 --> 00:43:24,919
boards and that was kind of on a channel

00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:26,179
because as the community grew there was

00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:27,829
nothing else to help everybody other

00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:29,959
group so we got the IRC council the

00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:31,339
forums council and the local council so

00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:33,439
the six of us elected to look after

00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:35,179
specifically loko teams and that means

00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:37,189
we actually have more time or energy to

00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:39,049
look after local teams rather than one

00:43:37,189 --> 00:43:41,749
council looking after all of the teams

00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:45,049
so that's that we've had to learn and as

00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:47,599
a community we've grown within the

00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:49,459
community council ourselves we've had to

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,229
look at the way we do approving team so

00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:53,719
teams have to show that they are more

00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:56,029
than a log more than just a group of

00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:58,009
fast enthusiasts they actually promoting

00:43:56,029 --> 00:44:01,189
a bunt too and so they come for a

00:43:58,009 --> 00:44:02,659
monthly meeting defer to be approved and

00:44:01,189 --> 00:44:04,309
they have to show and document on a wiki

00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:06,259
page how they're active photographs

00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:09,499
blogs you know showed they actually are

00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:11,989
taking part and that was one meeting a

00:44:09,499 --> 00:44:14,089
month and that wasn't working out so two

00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:16,189
cycles ago we realized that you know

00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:17,689
having a monthly meeting wasn't working

00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:19,789
so we do things to bug tracking and

00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:21,649
that's worked out but again it is a

00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:24,019
learning curve for us all because as the

00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:25,399
community grows our local teams are

00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:26,719
growing and that also means multiple

00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:29,299
time zones as also we need to fully

00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:31,219
appreciate that we are an IRS see the

00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,059
whole time so we'd have a factoid it's

00:44:31,219 --> 00:44:33,109
just small little things that you

00:44:32,059 --> 00:44:34,819
actually go that you might not realize

00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:35,760
two years ago well you know they can

00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:37,220
just email us and then

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,390
to realize it's also a language barrier

00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:41,640
to the six of us and not everybody

00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,810
speaks English there are three in Europe

00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,090
and three in the States and that's just

00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:47,520
because it's not there wasn't any active

00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:48,810
in Asia it's just that people who

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,720
brunette were nominated were the most

00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:52,920
active from those countries and it's not

00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,900
idea we would like to have more people

00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,190
from other countries but as the tea as

00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,410
the community goes we get more people

00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:01,230
involved in the greater community it

00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:03,270
will help so governance i think is a big

00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:05,790
key issue for us i think and i think for

00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,830
any community growing up if you can put

00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,540
in the foundations first of what you

00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,790
would like to see happening that if you

00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,200
have a main community and break it into

00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,640
sub areas if you can put that rogue

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,340
would work and before everything gets

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,520
kind of skewed it will kind of save you

00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,750
a lot of headache in the future okay

00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,960
Thank You Laura something that doesn't

00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,790
work in open Susie in the Ambassador

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,590
Program actually most of the things

00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,260
doesn't work correctly now that's an

00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:37,020
honest answer that's what we're trying

00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:39,120
to fix nowadays where we we don't like

00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,010
that we don't have a many strong local

00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,010
communities because most of the people

00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:48,060
in events you see a work in the global

00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:50,640
project rather than organizing a local

00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:53,130
groups we're trying to change that by

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,450
writing tons of recommendation and after

00:45:53,130 --> 00:46:01,560
correcting the recommendation we wrote

00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:06,510
we can have some financial control means

00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:08,550
of a wrote a program about that was yeah

00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:13,050
we have we have the same problem with

00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:15,180
India although we get the funding we try

00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:19,290
to keep the funding only in local

00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:22,350
traveling and not sponsoring people left

00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:25,710
for doing tricks outside their country

00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:30,000
so that we strength we give strength to

00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:31,590
the local communities well if office is

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,480
community we would be a human it would

00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:36,780
be a teenager nowadays because they have

00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,770
people constantly arguing about how

00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:43,380
things should go a the good thing in

00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:45,870
that point is that a in nothing to see

00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,790
we have a meritocracy so those who

00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,790
decide are those who actually work on

00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:54,050
the process

00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:55,550
so in all of that the bad cloud way we

00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:59,930
have we have met aggressive that

00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:03,800
actually help help us evolve and we hope

00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:07,730
in about 6-8 months to take a real

00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,680
estate I think we still have one left

00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,180
Hugh still need to tell us what doesn't

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,570
work in your community you don't have

00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:17,570
slides now that doesn't work in my gay

00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:19,940
community um firstly foremost what

00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:22,220
didn't work was setting up a centralized

00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:25,730
organization for the local communities

00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:29,510
because it was just forgotten because

00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:37,010
there was so much else to do this is an

00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:39,410
error we would like to to fix and to get

00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:41,900
in touch with the local communities we

00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:46,300
know about and to find out if there are

00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:51,140
any out there we don't know about so

00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:53,900
what doesn't work is most of us are not

00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:58,850
really experienced in building a

00:47:53,900 --> 00:48:02,210
worldwide community so we may just do

00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:06,850
lots of things that are not done in the

00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:10,460
best way but we are learning and we are

00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:11,750
taking advice from our users and the

00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:15,550
members of the worldwide community

00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:21,410
serious and try to fix what doesn't work

00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:22,850
ok how's it along here and yeah the

00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,230
language version in question whether

00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:26,720
thinking about is that to become

00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:29,270
officially involved in general you need

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,370
to your manage no English so you're able

00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:34,010
to communicate with the product at large

00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:37,250
but thinking about thinking if that is a

00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:39,050
limiting factor into for example Asia if

00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,460
you think about it's mostly Europe and

00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:42,200
North America where the most people are

00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,940
centered but it could also be just a

00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,490
question of open source communities in

00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,510
general in some areas are not as big as

00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:51,950
in Europe and North America none of the

00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,450
other people have people involved on

00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:56,120
major if you can come in all of his

00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:59,750
language or open source cultural issue

00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,790
in general okay I think we should

00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,090
continue with a quick round of questions

00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,220
from

00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:06,050
the audience because we are running out

00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:09,860
of time we have like five minutes left I

00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:11,690
think officially we can extend this in

00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,520
this room but you see there are most

00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:15,440
likely people who want to talk attend

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:26,840
other chart so let's hurry up your

00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:29,020
question please no questions I have a

00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,220
question about um how do you work with

00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:33,860
non-technical people or less technical

00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:35,570
people do you split communities do you

00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:46,250
keep them together with the developers

00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:50,270
how do you deal with them so I'm not a

00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:51,740
developer very vocal about that but we

00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:54,560
have developers and non developers

00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:56,060
working side by side in loco teams all

00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,580
our channels are a boon to dash

00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:01,400
namespace and the same for our logo team

00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:03,230
so in the wind to dash desktop channel

00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,210
for example you have canonical

00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:07,100
developers and local team people who are

00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:11,090
active and say bug triaging working side

00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:12,950
by side and as a nun developer I report

00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:14,360
books anybody can report a book you

00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:17,180
don't have to be technical to report a

00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:19,040
book we make translations very easy via

00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,170
launchpad it's click a button it's very

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,640
simple and we try and get people who are

00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:24,650
not developers looking at those two

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,970
areas also getting involved in

00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,680
documentation you might find the most

00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:29,360
person who's not developer is really

00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,830
good at reading English or really good

00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,170
at reading their own space specific

00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:34,940
language and spotting typos and you get

00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,320
them involved slowly and you get them

00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,490
evolved that way and that's how you

00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,470
become more involved in the open source

00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,400
community to be honest you don't have to

00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,540
secure them saying you have to be a

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,250
developer to be involved in a community

00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,120
because quite frankly that means you're

00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:49,790
pushing away some of your other

00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:51,530
community and that's not very fair so

00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:57,710
I'm not available either I'm a

00:50:51,530 --> 00:51:00,710
firefighter I anyway so we are using

00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:03,790
using people if someone wants to

00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:07,060
contribute the community all

00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:08,500
the only thing that he has is to want to

00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,480
contribute in the community we have

00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:13,540
people that don't know English and help

00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,790
us we're with the booths we have people

00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:20,500
that make translations everywhere people

00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:23,710
that make graphics we have a free sample

00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:27,390
project or an open source project needs

00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:29,830
we will do a lot of work and nowadays

00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:32,350
open source has a lot of programmers but

00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:36,940
not people that they are gráfica that do

00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:40,090
graphics and I have and have always

00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:43,150
needed translators okay a bogus needs

00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:45,790
people to go to events because what I

00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:47,590
see personally in Greece is that the

00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:50,770
only people that have boots increase our

00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:52,510
fedora and opensuse mainly in most of

00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:55,360
the events other communities are not so

00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:57,310
active not so active there the Buddha

00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:00,090
community in Greece is the most active

00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:03,910
community in the internet but at some

00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:07,920
point today I don't have boots and start

00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:07,920
something like that we use people to

00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:17,140
make all kinds of stuff to cover all the

00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:18,880
community okay no they're quite some

00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,190
things and non-technical people can do

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,140
for example of the biggest team we have

00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:25,510
in a non technical area is the

00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,550
internationalization you don't have to

00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:30,370
be a technical person to translate

00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:32,590
anything if its website translation

00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:36,460
block translation or actually the

00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:39,400
translation of our tools the next one is

00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:42,040
artwork you don't have to be a technical

00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,900
person to create a wallpaper or an icon

00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:48,370
or something like that and we have

00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:50,650
marketing we have communication the

00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:53,470
documentation team ok you should be a

00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,480
bit technical director q mutation but

00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:57,190
you don't have to be a developer or a

00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:01,060
packager to write good documentation

00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:06,280
rather different most developers do not

00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:09,100
write good documentation now assume we

00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:12,190
are opening up localized Vicky's so

00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:14,770
people can write wiki pages in their own

00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:16,480
languages up until now we only have an

00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:19,540
English wiki

00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,580
and we will try to have people from the

00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:24,940
internationalisation team that have a

00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:27,790
look at those localized Vicki's and ce4

00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:30,100
good documentation in the localized wiki

00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:33,450
and translate that back to english so it

00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:35,980
will be available for everyone else I

00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:39,640
know that's going to be a hard job for

00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:45,880
ya i 18 n but they elected me as team

00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:49,270
leader so there's no choice and I think

00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:52,630
if you really want to to help something

00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:55,450
you can actually find something but we

00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:57,280
did notice it's actually easier to get

00:53:55,450 --> 00:54:01,060
technical people than non-technical

00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,760
people into the project getting a

00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:08,950
packager is easy getting a good designer

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:10,570
it's hard I think the proper answer is

00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,920
that do not differentiate as much as

00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:13,510
possible i can change you we list

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:20,320
everyone under the developer at least no

00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:23,770
matter what they do now while it's in a

00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:27,730
smaller project so the 200 people in

00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:29,670
total and Lisa they're so so yeah this

00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:33,250
is one reason why we have embezzlers

00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:36,010
because ambassadors are also mentors to

00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:38,200
help non-technical people to find a way

00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,550
inside the Fedora project of course we

00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,460
have all the opportunities throughout

00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:44,530
work marketing and such stuff but I

00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:49,119
think it's really important to know a

00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:51,070
person in the project who knows the way

00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,590
around the project to find the right

00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:55,660
place for this non technical person so I

00:54:53,590 --> 00:55:00,220
think it's really important to have some

00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:02,350
people who can show where you where they

00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:06,010
can do non technical work you think this

00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:07,300
is really important ok I think there

00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:11,550
were two more questions in the

00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:13,840
background somewhere raise your hand

00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:16,170
question already solved ok then it's

00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,170
your turn

00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:22,230
we will repeat it it doesn't make sense

00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:22,230
to run around all the time

00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:44,200
I think spot can tell this answer those

00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:47,430
questions and then in the next trek we

00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:50,260
should repeat the question was about

00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:52,390
infrastructure if the infrastructure is

00:55:50,260 --> 00:56:06,280
run by the company or by the sponsor or

00:55:52,390 --> 00:56:08,170
if we okay so if people are looking if

00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:11,680
we are looking for us this up mems to to

00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:13,900
take care of our infrastructure so just

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,010
I'm not a specific title for your

00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,230
question but in debian we have

00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:18,820
volunteers doing the amazing work of

00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:20,980
doing the system is treasurer they will

00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:24,190
be there in the next session and i must

00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:26,380
say that raising a let's say a team or a

00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,839
generation of sysadmin to run your own

00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:30,880
infrastructure is very important and

00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:32,770
it's a great achievement that project

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,260
should look for to be independent from

00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:39,430
the possibly the main sponsor of the

00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:41,170
project I'm so with ubuntu all the

00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,730
resources are the wiki the websites

00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:46,240
they're all hosted on canonical servers

00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:48,400
and so it does have pros and cons about

00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,900
it to be honest all the wiki's is great

00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,460
it's very handy but sometimes for

00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,300
translations teams aren't really happy

00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,310
with that even though you could

00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:56,440
translate a wiki but for some of the

00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,930
funds and for the writing languages it

00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,960
isn't so easy they hold their own wiki's

00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:04,180
for the websites and there may be the

00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,560
wrong theme is there and the local teams

00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,599
don't have access to that so they have

00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:10,869
to log tickets to get updates for the

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,920
drupal websites teams may or may not

00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:13,359
like that and they go off and get their

00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,990
own hosting they have the option of

00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:18,220
doing that but yes so the community has

00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:20,200
nothing to do with the servers and I

00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:23,160
think the canonical like dunno and

00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:27,400
server so we have a separation there

00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:29,829
really lucky ones here we are hosted by

00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,569
Susur and sister service I don't know

00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:33,940
about this has me sis admins I don't

00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:39,400
know if we have volunteers a sadness or

00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:43,869
are suitable we have few so anyway we

00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:48,400
have we have a few okay the thing here

00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:49,349
is that we it is pretty easy for local

00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:54,690
teams to work

00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:57,539
in opensuse wiki and in if any local

00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:59,430
team once for like we have the Greek

00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:01,650
firm you just ask for the people and

00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:05,549
they give you soap we didn't actually

00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:07,979
have any problem for us taxi technically

00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:09,329
first accident again the forms again are

00:58:07,979 --> 00:58:12,720
hosted by canonical we don't have any

00:58:09,329 --> 00:58:14,849
issues if we have also for updates or we

00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,839
just log or T tickets and conical take

00:58:14,849 --> 00:58:17,670
care of it for us there's a good

00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:24,049
relationship between community and

00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:24,049
canonical right okay

00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:38,460
it is you know don't know maybe for like

00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:40,980
maybe I can say something about fedora

00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,440
infrastructure redhead does a point a

00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:46,440
fedora infrastructure leader who is

00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,450
coordinating the efforts around it but

00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,160
you can join the infrastructure team and

00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:52,770
you can really break things as a

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,030
community member if it our

00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:57,180
infrastructure leisure is a full-time

00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:59,220
job is simply red employee he gets paid

00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:02,040
by redhead so but nevertheless all the

00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,990
websites everything it's run by by the

00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:07,220
community they where we have a fedora

00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:10,170
admin IRC channel they are all the

00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:13,200
around-the-clock 24 7 I think the

00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:15,570
federal project home page has we had

00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,860
less updates up down times then

00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:23,370
microsoft com run with a completely

00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:25,740
community-run project okay the question

00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:28,530
wasn't really intended for me since i

00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:31,710
have no company that is doing anything

00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:34,380
so we have a quite great sysadmin team

00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:38,370
that does work on our service that does

00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:42,960
manage our service and they're really

00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:44,970
using up quite much of the free time we

00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,860
had a big server upgrade now where four

00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:48,510
people had to go to Marseilles and look

00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:53,760
at those service directly because

00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:58,460
hardware had to be changed and I think

00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:01,230
as a community team a community project

00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:06,090
there is no other way you have to look

01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:07,620
after them yourself yeah it's the same

01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:10,860
in ginger but that's one of the point of

01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:13,850
the question anyway ok I see there was

01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,850
another question over here

01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:32,930
work with so horrid bounties control him

01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:38,020
an amount of money for doing gotten up

01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:40,760
and hire people doing that is it working

01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:43,100
okay I just repeat the question it was

01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,660
about the the coordination between the

01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:48,890
contributors and especially about

01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:52,460
bounties so about having a certain goal

01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:54,830
and paying a certain amount of money for

01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:59,240
the person or for the team who gets this

01:00:54,830 --> 01:01:01,940
goal implemented right I could say no we

01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,900
don't have that in figure our next are

01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:09,970
you involved in google Summer of Code

01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:12,890
well it's sort of a bouncy Fedora is

01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:15,920
registered as a organization google

01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:19,660
Summer of Code we did some mentoring but

01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:22,340
it's not used that much to be honest

01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:25,060
what's the other Google godine that's

01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:28,970
all purely bounty programs I suppose

01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:35,440
yeah but well depends how you define

01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:39,440
bounty I guess Google kind of project

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:43,340
okay actually we don't have any money to

01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:45,830
give as a bounty to anyone because we do

01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:48,980
need our money to to keep the

01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:52,940
organization as a whole running so no we

01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:54,980
don't do it and the organization between

01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:57,380
the contributors is done in the council

01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:59,960
because every team has a representative

01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:03,440
in the council so we do the organization

01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:05,090
and the cooperation there so we don't

01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,830
have any bound in debian we are quite

01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:08,660
proud of being a volunteer project so

01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:10,400
there are of course people paid by their

01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:11,930
own employees to work on debian but this

01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,790
is something which is not coordinated by

01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:15,560
the project and i must say that for me

01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:18,830
is quite an interesting challenge to see

01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:20,660
a project based on volunteers to try to

01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:25,550
compete with other project which are

01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:27,500
complete a lot back by companies we

01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:29,540
don't either have people that are

01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:32,420
getting paid to do volunteering job

01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:34,309
except sushi employees but i don't know

01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,650
how this works for to say I

01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:39,349
I believe that the most of organs to see

01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:42,439
employees are volunteering to the

01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:46,910
opensuse community and not otherwise but

01:02:42,439 --> 01:02:48,619
I don't really know that we have I think

01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:50,569
the only people that are getting paid in

01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:53,839
novice to see are the project manager

01:02:50,569 --> 01:03:01,369
they just call me the community manager

01:02:53,839 --> 01:03:03,709
okay and AJ with n coolio anyway I don't

01:03:01,369 --> 01:03:06,079
I have we have two or three people

01:03:03,709 --> 01:03:08,239
getting paid but there are sushi

01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,369
employees that they are actually here to

01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:13,430
help the community nobody other gets its

01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:15,049
getting made no there's no such thing as

01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:17,749
the bounty kind of thing in ubuntu I

01:03:15,049 --> 01:03:20,239
mean people take part in helping a bun

01:03:17,749 --> 01:03:22,729
to be it like so the local team portal

01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:24,859
was created with the help of actually

01:03:22,729 --> 01:03:26,749
people from Florida and different teams

01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:29,299
worldwide building at developing on out

01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:30,949
we had some help from canonical at one

01:03:29,299 --> 01:03:33,109
point and people can apply for

01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:35,390
sponsorship twice here to attend a

01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:36,769
bougie developer so much but not

01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:38,529
everybody gets it so there's no such

01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:40,910
thing as really as a bounty to be honest

01:03:38,529 --> 01:03:46,999
okay else for questions one final

01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:48,679
question I mean time is up yes in fact

01:03:46,999 --> 01:03:55,279
we are already like eight minutes

01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:57,369
overtime okay okay then I'm sorry for

01:03:55,279 --> 01:03:57,369
