good morning raise your hand if you are

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:19,400
awake almost everybody good raise your

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:23,939
hand if you are not a debian person

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,160
excellent i'd like to have a few so good

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:30,390
morning america leaning debian developer

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,759
and i'm kind of responsible for bap tags

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,469
which is the categories the

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:40,530
categorization system for Debian

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:45,090
packages okay the my screen still shows

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:48,360
the first slide confusing when you just

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,960
woke up and have it had breakfast so

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,170
okay so the point of the talk is that

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,879
I've recently rewritten the the whole

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,789
website that manages the categorization

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,680
of packages and I'd like to talk about

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,530
it because I think there's interesting

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,729
bits and bits that can also be used by

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,320
other distributions so that exists the

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,400
category system for them in packages

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,060
about nine years old now it's faceted

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,790
classification which means that

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,369
categories are grouped in in facets

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,150
which is like groups of categories and

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:31,110
each facet is homogeneous like all the

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:35,070
categories in a facet are represent to

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:39,960
the same kind of concept for example

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:43,079
there is a facet for what language the

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,210
package is implemented in so this is

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:51,210
implemented in C C++ and there is a

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:53,189
facet for what language does this do

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,170
software development so that the

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,390
categories are like the same but in one

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,579
case you know you could have something

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:06,149
written in C to come to work with pearl

00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:09,239
like the Perl interpreter and then so by

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,720
grouping categories in different facets

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,640
it things make a lot more sense

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,200
it's a controlled vocabulary so it's not

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,090
if you are used to tags in like

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,990
delicious that's focus on them you can

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,060
type whatever you want as a tag but we

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,030
went for a controlled vocabulary so

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,620
there is a central vocabulary and in

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,320
order to have a new tag you send an

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,970
email to mailing list and then proposing

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,120
the tagging and it will be committed in

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,960
some version control system and yeah and

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,020
then you have it and it's currently 615

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:51,390
times in 31 facets so it's rather

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:53,070
extensive and expensive the

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,890
classification is anonymous throw the

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,959
data is collected in a wiki like way but

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,260
then there's a manual review because

00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:04,500
with it there are parks which it's nice

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,330
to give them semantic value like if you

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,590
say something is a shared library then

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,770
you don't want to show it in a package

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,350
manager but since you want to do

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,780
something based on tags then you want to

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,510
have a bit of a review to avoid rubbish

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,360
going in the database and firefox

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:25,019
disappearing from the package managers

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,300
because it's not because it's somebody

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,489
tagged it as a shared library oh there's

00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:35,970
no Firefox in type in action managed

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:39,090
better anyway but anyway okay and it

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:41,220
takes the holdup in ecosystem or we're

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,970
getting there it's currently debian and

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,790
ubuntu and perfect derivative from

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,799
debian but we are now integrating the

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,200
vin derivative sensors to have any type

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,760
in derivative distribution involved and

00:03:52,200 --> 00:04:01,140
it clearly knows all about 38,000 and so

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:05,790
packages there's also roberts tagging

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,920
things but i'll show that later so yeah

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,739
there's a web interface that tries to

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,660
make things as easy as possible so when

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,489
you go and categorize packages you have

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,959
in suggestions and we're going to see

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:21,959
those later and the website i wrote like

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,750
five or six years ago was had a custom

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,430
c++ backend demon for speed that was

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,750
queried by CGI

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,430
and I could like somebody said oh it

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,870
would be nice to have that feature in

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,710
the website and I was like yet will be

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:40,560
nice to its no way I'm going to do it on

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:44,070
this code base and so I already written

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,110
the lot using stuff that's rather

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,880
standard at the moment than five years

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,030
from now people say how are you were

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,940
using Chaco haha silly you but I well at

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,310
the moment that's really nice to walk on

00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:01,680
so it's night it's possible to implement

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:03,509
all sort of features on it okay so maybe

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,430
the introduction to depth X is getting a

00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,759
bit long and I should probably show the

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,759
website

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,690
I

00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:29,319
okay not that impressive

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,820
nope

00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,460
okay this is the list of facets all the

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:02,350
groups of tags that we have so we start

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:06,700
having an idea of what we are talking

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:09,340
about so this is like one of the main

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,070
facets which is role they're all other

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,670
package in the system it's designed so

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:23,140
that each package should have one tag

00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:26,410
from it and these are the tags well

00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,890
doesn't fit but let's see idea so you

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:32,530
have programs and share blight

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,080
development libraries shared libraries

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:39,190
and it should be kind of familiar it's

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:43,650
the usual stuff you find in a in a

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:47,980
package repository now just having this

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:51,190
these tags is enough to do quite a bit

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:54,430
of semantical stuff like you can hide

00:06:51,190 --> 00:07:01,560
shared libraries or you can say I'm not

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:01,560
a developer or you know

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:17,210
then we have something which is a bit

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:20,060
more task oriented so there are sets of

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:23,779
tags for specific uses like this doesn't

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:26,330
apply to the whole archive but it's very

00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:32,449
nice to provide a view of the games in

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:41,629
debian a new addition i would like to

00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:44,419
welcome is the system which is what kind

00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:47,419
of system this software is specific for

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:51,139
so like a personal information manager

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:54,139
for tablets would be like system mobile

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,419
and then a configuration management for

00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,819
cloud systems than the be system cloud

00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:03,080
and it's quite nice because it also

00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:07,520
allows you to see the packages see how

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,650
broadly scoped is the package archive so

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,919
you know you can go from embedded

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:17,870
control devices mobile systems and

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:23,240
servers and boo so it's also nice to

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:30,009
have a way to kind of improve the

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:34,430
perception of the packages themselves ok

00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:40,449
so that's a browser of the vocabulary we

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:40,449
can search for I don't know browser

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:57,110
I made a little package search system

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:59,240
and it's got the faceted navigation on

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,360
the right which you may be familiar from

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:07,670
shopping websites this is like proof of

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:12,710
concept and i do want programs only

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:15,650
thank you and there you have it there's

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,600
also possibility of filtering for like

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,190
show me only desktop applications and

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:28,100
that's just done work by a combination

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:36,340
of tags that is not a program so we

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:36,340
click on it not there we click on it and

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:44,840
that's the classification editor and

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:47,360
browser wicket with ipx capability it

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,450
does not sound like a program although

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,450
it does have a screenshot oh that's

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,940
complicated so maybe it is a program but

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,010
I would like to talk with the person

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:02,290
that packaged it do we have any

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:05,600
parenting people no probably not ok

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:08,000
never mind if we decide it's not a

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,350
program we just remove program and do

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,880
submit

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:21,760
and that's it what yeah anybody can do

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:21,760
that it's all outside move it whatever

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:37,410
there is one change change to submit

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:39,690
haha okay we removed it don't yeah you

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:48,839
can go ahead and clear the whole data

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:52,279
set I have backups so the system will

00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:55,470
suggest you tags it does suggest program

00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:58,769
but probably because it had program so

00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:03,899
it was like used to be program maybe

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:06,600
it's not a bad idea it mentions DK so

00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,790
it's a testicle that kind of makes sense

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,310
and it's also suggest development

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,310
library which does makes a lot of sense

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:22,170
it should also say oh there's a chance

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:26,819
that a whole program is missing probably

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:30,990
because it says that it's got an

00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:34,529
interface so it's got the next interface

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,899
so it chances are it's a program it

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:39,329
makes sense there are statistical

00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,880
algorithms that analyze the tag

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:45,269
distribution and give you feedback like

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,610
the shopping algorithm things like you

00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:50,250
both this you may want to buy that as

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,750
well at exactly the same thing that runs

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:58,589
on tires and you tagged it like that

00:11:51,750 --> 00:12:01,290
maybe you want that tag too ok there's

00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:03,649
pop-ups with more information about tags

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,649
and

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:11,339
it's also roll documentation is rarely

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,440
used in this way because you don't have

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:17,160
usually a documentation with the next

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,880
interphase probably so remove tag roll

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:24,360
documentation thank you and it says well

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,610
you need to have some role for it so it

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,470
does have this smart way of guiding you

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:34,470
through tagging it's limited but it does

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:40,230
get you to cover the bases like and and

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:41,940
I can use this to give hints to people

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,339
who are talking out of my experience

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,560
like if I want to set the target that

00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:50,000
every package must have a role tag then

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,520
I just had a hint for it to check and

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:59,700
and it worked Oh loads of suggestions

00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:01,800
here ok nevermind well we'll get in

00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,420
touch with the maintainer of it oh

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:08,730
there's no link for the maintain it it's

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:12,089
funny also you are anonymous to the

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:15,330
system but since it correlates adits

00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:22,430
together via a cookie I can see my patch

00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:22,430
history no big deal but

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,480
and and since there's loads of checks

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,170
then I can build to-do lists with

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,020
packages that that fail those checks and

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:37,940
these are sorted by popularity so you

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,670
see the obvious stuff that needs to be

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,470
done first I tried to make several entry

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,900
points for people that want to help with

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,990
the tagging to actually go in the site

00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:52,550
and start doing something there's a

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:55,130
getting started page that has several

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,430
links to places where we could do

00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:03,230
something there's also a tag cloud which

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:05,150
are so 90s and it's also so ugly but it

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,090
was like it's a prototype this one and

00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:17,420
you could say yes I want roll program

00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:19,460
and no I don't want utilities and then

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,860
you get packages and and you can

00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,560
navigate like that and if you think

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:31,850
there's packages that don't fit you can

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:36,440
go to tag editor and you can just remove

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:38,450
them sorry i sorry you can just remove

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,770
edit the tags like it's not a program

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:49,250
that start a program okay nevermind they

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:52,010
are programs so well it mostly it's

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,480
experiments of mine too to try to tag

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,400
from different points of view sometimes

00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,620
it's nice to take a package and say

00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,120
these are the categories sometime

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:04,190
sometimes it's nice to say show me all

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,950
first person shooting games and then see

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:11,300
if there's something that doesn't fit

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:12,770
and having a flexible site now allows me

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,130
to do all these kind of experiments

00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,130
quite easily

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,040
let's go back to those lines

00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:34,350
so uses of that thanks that the whole

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,120
point was back in 2003 that there were

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,800
discussions on they've been developing

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,600
mating is like oh we should stop

00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,439
accepting new packages because that mean

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,910
is too big I was like no let's just make

00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:49,470
that bein able to cope with more

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:51,509
packages and so one way one idea was to

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,999
have a categorization system that could

00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:57,180
scale because the previous one was like

00:15:53,999 --> 00:16:00,629
only one section per package and it

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,850
didn't scale that well it did have a

00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:04,920
very nice side effect that you can move

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,259
pointers details away from package

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,319
subscriptions it's like if you see a

00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:14,809
package whose description is this is a

00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:18,540
poor utility to with the gtk interface

00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:20,249
to do something then you can just take

00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,069
away all that and say this is a program

00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:25,649
to do something and then all the

00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:27,779
detailed these kind of technical details

00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,519
that can be represented by categories

00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,189
then you just do it by categories those

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,790
are shown in package managers so there's

00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:38,579
no point in the world nobody generally

00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:41,490
you're not interested in what you I

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,990
toolkit this have but if you are rich in

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,480
the categories and you don't clutter

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:51,240
descriptions with unneeded details or

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:53,939
generally unneeded details there's some

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,620
semantic aspects of tags then hide an

00:16:53,939 --> 00:17:00,240
interesting packages is quite useful

00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:04,049
recently there's been experiments or for

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,870
linking the harbor categories to limited

00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:08,579
hardware detection so you could have a

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,669
feature like you want to install this

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:18,059
package but you do not have a DVD burner

00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:19,679
I'm sure you want to continue oh I have

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,579
a DVD burner and have so many packages

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:26,280
that can use it or something like that

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:30,090
it's an experiment but it's nice it I

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:33,600
find it interesting to attach two

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:37,530
categories some code that can kind of do

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,460
or guess something about them there can

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:42,809
be the main specific package managers

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:47,330
let's see if I have go play installed

00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:47,330
I've recently reinstalled my machine

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,860
how did

00:17:53,929 --> 00:18:00,980
it's like a package manager for games

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:03,259
which shows you games and you can choose

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:07,450
what type of game you like to play and

00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:07,450
what interface well and

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:19,059
and I want to play text-based

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:22,059
interactive games and you have a list so

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:26,290
i can on the terminal I can play these

00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:30,640
kind games or well there's something

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:32,200
wrong oh no it was both there's

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,840
something wrong going on there's more

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,740
interfaces there's like 3d interface at

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:43,990
least i'm not going to debug it now but

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:46,600
as a general idea and to play with

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:53,200
things you could do the same thing and

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:57,280
say go admin and have the set but system

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,870
administration tools obviously you'd

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,760
like to change the interface the

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,040
screenshot isn't that useful maybe you

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,100
want to give more descriptions of

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,070
packages or something but it's a it's

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:13,620
kind of a prototype to hint at the idea

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:17,140
of having task-specific package managers

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:19,480
the their surprise of in what you can do

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,270
with the specific stuff that we recently

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,290
found out that debian is like the most

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:28,660
widespread operating system for

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,750
neurosurgeons and there's like a debian

00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:35,320
booth at the world's leading

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:38,650
neuroscience conference and and it's

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:42,160
very big there and like what but yeah

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:44,760
make sense and you know that could be

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,760
catered for

00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,600
okay and then as we've seen search

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,580
functions that allow you to say yes I

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,340
want programs and yes I want them

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:05,550
graphical and I want to work with this

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:07,770
kind of file you can I did something or

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:11,250
there's the mime type database for that

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,080
but you could until we extract Miami

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,820
information from packages in an index

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,920
you could do something the points at the

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:25,430
file detects the mime type and show all

00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:35,040
the packages that can open it okay let's

00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:44,280
skip it late so a 2 of the website we've

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:46,730
seen a bit okay there are statistics we

00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,730
can see

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,680
you

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,650
uh

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,639
okay the numbers are similar to what

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:13,440
I've been showing before it does mention

00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:22,510
tagged by human and tagged by robots and

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:26,559
this is it so those are tied by humans

00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:36,100
and those are tagged by robots yes no

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:38,559
yes yes okay what that means when a

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:42,070
package is first seen by the site its

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:45,909
marked with the tag that that says this

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:47,500
hasn't been reviewed by human yet and if

00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:53,429
you are a human and review it then

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:56,049
you're supposed to take that tag out so

00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:58,510
so the system can tell whether it's

00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:01,840
something that's unreviewed by nobody or

00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:05,019
not things that no human has touched yet

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,179
there's all sort of heuristics that our

00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:09,100
backs to them like look at the package

00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:12,429
name and say well that looks like a perv

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:15,279
library target / library something like

00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:17,559
that so there is a basic of tagging

00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,230
throughout the system although it may

00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:23,799
not be perfect once you remove the

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:26,289
marker then the robots will respect the

00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:30,070
higher intelligence and not touch the

00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:32,399
package anymore so they won't mess up

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:34,649
the tagging after you reviewed it

00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:37,059
hopefully it's a higher intelligence but

00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:41,019
generally et so I mean system seems to

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:43,539
work and and that's like the number of

00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:45,460
tags per package and so you got like

00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:49,500
loads of packages with few tags and then

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:52,950
very few packages with loads of tags

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:57,519
nevermind not that useful except is it

00:22:52,950 --> 00:23:00,630
that's the list of packages with the

00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:05,610
outliers packages with loads of tags and

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,610
squid happens to have loads of tags

00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:14,559
anyway and that's all that the automatic

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,860
checks that are run on the system and

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,860
bah

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:33,640
let's go back to the editor squid is a

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:35,950
bit insane I'm not sure it should well

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,280
most of these things actually apply this

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:44,490
weird anyway there's the suggested tags

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,490
and there's like all tags then you can

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:53,850
tag that way you can search tags so

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,660
and you can search pretty freely those

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,730
don't need to be keywords in the tag

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,040
descriptions because I did something

00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:17,310
weird there's load images and he did say

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:19,650
works with images it's it's a bit

00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:25,560
country the way it works but it's really

00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:27,390
quite nice to to find tags you need by

00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,540
just saying I want something kind of

00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:32,970
like that because I cannot pretend that

00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:36,530
people actually know all those seven

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:39,180
hundred tags I need to provide ways for

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:42,380
people to search the more for the tags

00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,380
to be suggested to them

00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,250
and I can do patch review

00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:13,520
which is the process to bring those

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:13,520
submissions into debian

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,529
is there a pop-up somewhat no okay okay

00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:29,200
these are the parts that have been

00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:34,360
submitted this is an example of somebody

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:38,020
that doesn't do doesn't use cookies in

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:42,490
the browser which I find annoying from

00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:45,730
this side of the barricade because then

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:47,590
i have like several editor of MDB tools

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,320
when it's obviously arts obvious is the

00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:54,520
same person and so it could have been

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,730
shown like this that somebody who's been

00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:01,120
like tagging all their packages and and

00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:03,190
i can easily review it and say yeah that

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,640
makes sense that makes sense generally

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:13,480
yeah definitely looks like a sane person

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:17,490
to me no need to see them all why it's

00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,490
not harder video that one

00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:22,959
it looks like it is actually so yeah

00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:32,619
but it seems to have that he or she

00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:34,869
seems to have a point there I don't know

00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:37,330
enough to be able to tell so I'll just

00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:43,059
leave it like that and let somebody else

00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:46,629
fix it there's the past we submit and

00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:49,379
then yeah and then i can say submit

00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:49,379
somewhere

00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:02,749
and I should go in debian after a couple

00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,749
days

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,460
eventually

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,170
so the workflow is actually this one

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,510
using cookies they're grouped by the

00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:23,720
same person so basically when you review

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:26,030
you can just make a judgment like same

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,150
submission or a person that was trying

00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:31,130
the website by clicking every button

00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:35,780
that's the two kinds of submissions we

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:39,679
get and if it's saying then you just say

00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:41,330
okay and then once that's reviewed it

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,530
gets committed into version control

00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:54,550
system so I get historical backups and

00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:54,550
then eventually upload it to Debian yeah

00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:07,000
yeah it will be at the bottom of the

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:17,190
list of stuff to review there should be

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:23,050
actually we removed the leap TK pattern

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:28,120
that's the edit i did and i can say i

00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:33,160
know that person's totally insane ere we

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:36,150
go so i can actually amend the changes

00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,150
before submitting them

00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,690
well you can edit it again

00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:54,649
others nandu but there's an undo before

00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:54,649
sending so before we send

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,590
that's

00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:08,460
let's go mess up 5-4 so there is Firefox

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,600
in that mean after all no it could be in

00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:14,600
a bootblack so I've edited something and

00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,400
it has there's three changes to submit I

00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,380
actually know it is a web browser and it

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,510
does work with HTML and it's anything

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,510
it's ok ok then nevermind

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:41,420
so currently the reviewed tags go into

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:43,860
the archive and then over and then

00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:46,020
packages are all attacked by name so

00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,770
every version of that package will get

00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:52,740
those tags it works ninety-five percent

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:57,360
of the times there's all the cases in

00:29:52,740 --> 00:30:00,990
which it breaks so the current tags of

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:05,670
chromium do not actually apply to Debian

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:07,710
stable because or get it used to be

00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:11,640
called get coal because there were such

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:13,320
things as new interactive tools in the

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,760
past that was called gating so there's

00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:21,500
been a name transition and so it doesn't

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,570
always work to talk stuff by name only

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:28,320
you need to talk them by version but it

00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:31,290
gets the too messy so the idea is to

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,460
allow tax to be overridden inside

00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:38,370
packages but that doesn't work yet

00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,290
there's a new workflow proposed but it

00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:44,100
hasn't been discussed much it's just an

00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:46,950
idea of I'm trying to move to a way in

00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:50,790
which a package maintainer can override

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:55,800
stuff from that begs Debian net if it

00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:57,420
makes sense but yeah that there's going

00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,820
to be more of that possibly in that

00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,550
enlists once I managed to talk it

00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,620
through with ftp masters and provide

00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:09,480
some pass to the archive system and so

00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:11,070
on there's QA to the list that we have

00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,610
seen we haven't seen the one per

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,610
maintainer

00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,620
so I maintain packages and so I have a

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,700
page for myself with the packages I

00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:38,470
maintain and the to-do list oh you

00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:41,200
bastard go and do some work so it

00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,700
indexes several distributions but I can

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,980
say that I don't feel like talking

00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,400
anything for the moon to today and then

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,730
you go I hide all the Ubuntu packages

00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:54,150
and also hide the Debian packages and

00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:59,350
only there is a package but that's a

00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:01,390
glitch that is going to be fixed there's

00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,300
going to be so many more distributions

00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:07,510
in this box and I have to figure out how

00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:11,740
to lay them out I think there's about 50

00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:14,830
in the Debian derivative census that's

00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:18,930
going to be interesting and so yeah

00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:24,840
these are all my packages and then oh

00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:30,220
let's get one that makes sense to tag

00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:33,840
not many oh this one aha this is an

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,840
example can you read this

00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:51,120
here's an example of a case where the

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:54,910
hints are wrong that's a display manager

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,210
which just logs you in it doesn't ask

00:32:54,910 --> 00:33:01,120
who you are it's configured like for

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:02,800
kiosk machines you could just say well

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,380
when the system boots open the next

00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,710
session as this user without asking any

00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:11,860
password I'm a kiosk I don't people

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:14,290
can't login via you know a touchscreen

00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:17,380
and then they don't need to when did

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:20,470
only runs a browser or it only runs the

00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:23,050
control interface for industrial devices

00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:26,530
and it's that kind of display manager so

00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:28,570
it is our display manager but it doesn't

00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:32,440
have a UI toolkit because it doesn't

00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:34,300
open any window in that case that the

00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,880
suggestion is reasonable but in this

00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,800
case wrong that there's loads of corner

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,720
cases and that's where being an

00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,480
intelligent human makes sense i can

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,250
choose to ignore that whereas if it were

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,180
automatically tag then the system would

00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:50,410
just add it and it wouldn't be correct

00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:55,300
no I would not it cause it wouldn't know

00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:59,880
which UI toolkit to use but anyway so

00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:03,100
personal page that page is linked from

00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:06,640
like QA dot Debian door and all the

00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:08,649
other per package report pages so one

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,360
can have a look at the sort of personal

00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:13,740
to-do list in debian and then there's

00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,740
also going to be tags

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:29,349
and then there's a bit of internals like

00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,349
it does export the whole tag set

00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:43,340
there's links these are just download

00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:45,740
links and you can download all the other

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:49,419
view tags and all the review tags the

00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:53,300
whole data set is available for download

00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:56,149
there is well these are like used by the

00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:59,060
editor and so on the vocabulary is a

00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:01,520
static file it's a static javascript

00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:04,040
file with all the descriptions so I load

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,260
it in the tag editor so browsers can

00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,540
cash it and the description don't need

00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,410
to be loaded over and over again silly

00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:15,050
things like that these are the the code

00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,330
with all the checks that are done that

00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,210
all the hints you get obviously there's

00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:26,510
also the source code to download over

00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:28,640
here and so using these links you can

00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:31,310
just set up con jobs that upload that

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,580
download the new version of the database

00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:38,660
and you can get the reviewed categories

00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:41,630
for Ubuntu for example or any other

00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:44,000
distribution that's covered by this or

00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:46,670
you could just download this converted

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,770
by a distal match she's a tool that can

00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,840
map package names across distributions

00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:54,609
and then you get tags for your non

00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,609
Debian style distribution as well

00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:11,670
there is a bit of a Web API which is

00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:17,010
used by the various pages one this one

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:20,220
NH documented a bit so there's like an

00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:25,590
ati to submit patches that are changes

00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:28,320
and that shows how to do it any war

00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:35,280
reply saying if the change was okay if

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:37,980
it changed something and and old and

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,570
there's also other api's for searching

00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:43,530
packages but i haven't published them

00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:46,590
yet because they are not that stable but

00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:48,930
i intend to do so and these api's can be

00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:52,110
called from anywhere there's a cross

00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,970
origin resource sharing headers so that

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:56,310
you have a any javascript from

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:59,100
everywhere can call these and send

00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:02,360
patches and scroll all the data no

00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,360
problem there's backups

00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,770
I won't got that much into the internals

00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:25,320
I accept

00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:53,839
this is a bit of internal I'd like to

00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:57,769
show dependencies it's free Python

00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:01,549
packages fight on debian is candy pure

00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:03,289
python so there's no particularly

00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:07,519
dubbing specific dependencies it's

00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:15,980
Python jungle zapien and a module to

00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:20,240
read some llamo like files it there's a

00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:27,019
configuration file that you used us to

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:30,289
put parts and that's it you can run the

00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:35,299
server there is a procedure that

00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:37,609
downloads package information since it

00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:39,859
needs to cover debian ubuntu and so on

00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:43,490
it does not make any use of the local

00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:45,619
apt database for example because there's

00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:50,890
no up to database that can cover all

00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:53,630
that in and Ubuntu and so it's it's

00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:56,089
quite easy I mean it's definitely

00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:58,430
possible to pour this to another

00:38:56,089 --> 00:39:00,650
distribution you just need to export

00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:03,200
your package names and descriptions at

00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:05,509
the moment it will import them in a

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,880
llamo like format it's used by Debian

00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,799
but it's not that hard to change the

00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,569
exporter if if you just don't want to

00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:17,500
convert it a one to read your native

00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:17,500
format and that's about it update data

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,420
update data downloads package

00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:46,539
information source package information

00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:52,469
to see who are the maintainer popularity

00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:52,469
contest is optional you can do without a

00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:58,390
seed of stable tags which is also

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,099
optional and the vocabulary information

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:05,380
and then runs the maintenance scoop that

00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:07,420
will index everything and they update

00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,670
apotheke shop in index that will also

00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,729
index everything and that that can also

00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:17,249
be run from other distributions there is

00:40:12,729 --> 00:40:19,959
a wiki page showing how to have an

00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:23,999
exception index of packages for non

00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,999
debian distributions and

00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:36,550
also the theme the the graphical theme

00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:40,560
of the website is a pluggable Django

00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:44,650
application i created a generic Jungo up

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:48,130
for the debian website layout and so

00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:50,050
everything else just the derives from it

00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:53,580
and doesn't do any particular layout

00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:57,490
themselves so it's rather easy to just

00:40:53,580 --> 00:41:01,990
switch that with a page that has a

00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:04,330
different banding if someone from a

00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:07,300
bundle would like to do the work of

00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:12,310
doing the branding then I wouldn't mind

00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:16,270
doing something that it says that that

00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:19,480
says if it comes as depth x dot ubuntu

00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:21,880
com then show different landing that can

00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:31,210
easily be done jungle so i support for

00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:33,250
it so yeah that's that's what you can do

00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:36,310
if you want to set this up on for non

00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:38,110
debian distributions i'm happy to assist

00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:40,810
I'm not happy to do the work for you

00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:42,970
obviously because I can't manage that

00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:47,320
that takes installations for everyone

00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:49,560
but yeah I can assist and then if you

00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,790
set this up we can trade submissions

00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,310
submissions are apart there's a patch

00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:57,220
queue of stuff that is submitted and I

00:41:54,310 --> 00:42:00,790
can just send you my queue overview

00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:03,460
changes you can send me yours or I can

00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:05,260
just download your new database and make

00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:09,550
a difference from the previous version

00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:14,200
and so yeah things are tradable and

00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:16,030
shareable and stealable and as a work

00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,460
I've done on my Christmas holidays so I

00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:20,460
think I deserve a substantial uploads

00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:35,860
questions there should be limited time

00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,860
for questions

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,710
I now repeat the question

00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,910
ok how many the question is how many

00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:55,100
reviewers do we have for the Debian

00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:59,780
version of depth X and are we looking

00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:01,880
for volunteers so to submit patches to

00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:06,310
submit tags like the anonymous

00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:09,920
submissions it's difficult to count them

00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:11,960
but possibly every maintainer can just

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,540
take care of their own packages to

00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,660
review submissions then it's two of us

00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:21,730
at the moment I'm not yet looking for

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:25,220
volunteers because I would like first to

00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:27,470
allow people interested in one field to

00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:30,950
review only the changes for that field

00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:33,380
I'd like to to to have the Debian game

00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,690
team be able to review the game

00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:40,220
submissions then not have to bother with

00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:42,590
other things but I don't have that yet

00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:47,570
so I'm not reaching out I can manage

00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:53,000
loan actually it's it's less work than

00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:55,370
the spamming your inbox so you can do it

00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:04,750
once a week and and UD spam your inbox

00:43:55,370 --> 00:44:04,750
every day so yeah

00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,099
right

00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:40,990
so the question is can i search for tags

00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:51,540
using like up no I didn't understand the

00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:55,720
question then sorry yes oh okay I get it

00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:58,720
right it's a good point so the the what

00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,820
you propose is to be able like if if a

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,340
package contains for binary executable

00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,810
files that to tag each one indeed

00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:13,720
because they could be different I'll do

00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:16,900
20 so they could show in the application

00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,849
menu I tried reaching out to three

00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:23,440
desktop years ago saying well there's

00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:26,470
also those categories and there's

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:32,099
there's a category system in dot desktop

00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:32,099
files and that's been standardized then

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:42,030
there is already a category system for

00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:42,030
application menus what

00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:46,930
Oh

00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:53,960
so these are ready categorized and I

00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:57,640
didn't design that I may or may not like

00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:00,350
it but it's already a standard so I

00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,330
don't think nobody would listen to me if

00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:05,950
I propose something else there's also

00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:12,500
talk about removing these kind of menus

00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:15,080
anyway so no idea I did make something

00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,780
experimental that shows binary

00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:20,390
executable available in the system by

00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,580
the tags of the packages they are in

00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:25,340
it's obviously a bit fuzzy when these

00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:27,680
things are different like a program that

00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:31,610
a package that provides main application

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,980
and set of utilities obviously the to

00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:35,900
have totally different acts one can be a

00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:41,150
command-line tool and one can be a GUI

00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:44,180
application but one can split the

00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:47,630
package if that becomes a problem or the

00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:52,120
note am i running out of time somebody

00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:52,120
should throw a shoe to me if

00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:00,030
so there was a strange sign there yeah

00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:16,680
okay it's technically easy to do it

00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:22,530
hasn't been done yet there's a very good

00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:29,880
people that intend to do it the point is

00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:33,800
that tags have a silly name which you

00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:36,860
don't want to show users like this one

00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:40,170
this one could just be used as a handle

00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:42,390
you don't translate this it translate

00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:45,090
everything else but then that's the

00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:47,420
string you show to use it and so

00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:52,350
technically it's trivial to translate

00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:54,480
but then I don't know much about get

00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:57,090
text so I'm not that good at doing it

00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,390
myself other people may not know much

00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:03,480
about that text and we haven't yet got

00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:07,230
together with nuff common push to do it

00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:09,390
but yeah it's possible I'm not sure I'm

00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:11,730
going to translate the website it

00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:14,370
probably doesn't make much sense to

00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:17,430
translate this website but it does make

00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:20,280
sense to translate it for applications

00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:23,620
definitely like you do one software

00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,930
center or whatever to show

00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:30,000
those kind of things in your language

00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:30,000
because that software is translated

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,090
there is a yes

00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:13,700
and then it will suggest you that the

00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,700
stack spaced out loud

00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,880
Oh

00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:29,310
it does suggest he was the tags and then

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,310
you can do something like

00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:49,040
it does have boolean things

00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:56,959
as fast it uses a local it's based on

00:49:54,119 --> 00:50:00,859
the local after picks up getting this

00:49:56,959 --> 00:50:00,859
which does it start

00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:12,640
ok

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,620
I guess time's up

00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,620
