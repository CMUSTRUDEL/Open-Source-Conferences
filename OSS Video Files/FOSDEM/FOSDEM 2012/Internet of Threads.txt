thank you very much I want to start this

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:13,080
talk with the preventive thanks so if

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,299
something if something's going along

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,830
with the demonstration I already thanked

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,570
everybody so first of all I thank the

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,490
proton committee that I've selected my

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:32,210
talk so that gave me the whole no

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:37,320
responsibility to get this dog so

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:39,809
preventive information if we are looking

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,170
for some for more information about to

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:47,539
the projects you can shoot at me I mean

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:51,030
with male photo cameras with the cameras

00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:54,570
the largest one at the wiki site of the

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,710
smallest one is my email address okay

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:02,010
and if you find me a cyber so I I need

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:12,630
to wear something more than my shirt the

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:22,220
same clothes are here okay sir in the

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:26,750
beginning network was made by hosts so

00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:30,720
the addressable entities well these

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:35,119
interfaces this quite new for me it's a

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,890
10 megabytes or with the coaxial socket

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,970
when I started dealing with networking

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:48,890
we had the thick cables and the vampire

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:52,110
top dog cables and so on anyway when we

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:56,250
are looking to something looking for

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,759
something you type a a fully qualified

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:04,170
name and there is a domain name server

00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:06,869
that translate into address and what do

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,679
you name with that number with that IP

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:13,340
address one of these so the situation

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:18,980
and this you

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:24,750
an appetizer this yellow boxer is a

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:27,510
piece of hardware you name the interface

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,270
if there is a table of the the

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,880
server-side client-side this right

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:37,530
similar but there is a table of

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:41,400
listening sockets and in you reach your

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:46,670
server because there is a mapping

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:54,260
between the sock number and your demon

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:57,720
now I have to explain this picture here

00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,640
it's funny that it gives continuity to

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,180
the session because the previous two

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:09,950
talk was about to enter a telephony but

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:15,720
i decided to insert the data icon on

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:21,030
friday night i was in a very crowded

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:24,110
place named a link affair and i was i

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:29,880
was a beer storming with a sales

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:32,580
brainstorming okay and i was looking for

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,830
a word to describe the difference

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,440
between the current internet and

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,140
Internet of threads and they came

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,880
certain that the telephony system is

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:48,690
quite a good example one time ago we had

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:53,640
fixed line so that you have we had the

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:57,840
right papers and we we were able to find

00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:01,350
people because we look for people into

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,780
the white pages we dealt the number but

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,870
in the reality we didn't find out people

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:11,730
we found out houses because the phone

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,260
line adversus houses not people ok so

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:18,080
the exactly the same yeah you're

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:23,930
addressing the house of processes

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:30,090
there's yesterday ah it's a

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:33,650
it has made a good thing it was good the

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:37,379
morn that evening and the morning were

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:43,669
second day we are developers so we are

00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:48,300
creators we can use biblical words today

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:54,569
virtual machine hora play versus so we

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:59,400
are we're addressing virtual interfaces

00:04:54,569 --> 00:05:02,539
we are a young developers where does

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,090
enviable interfaces of virtual machines

00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:09,240
will just visualize that the entire box

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:13,349
but but we are keeping the old concepts

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,560
when providing all concepts other

00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:19,469
example if you are running high a little

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,400
bit of servers you give a number of

00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:25,830
different IP addresses of the other to

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,880
the same interface because we want to be

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:33,599
free to move the services by moving the

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:37,529
dress it's it's like in the in the

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:41,340
metaphor to have a number of different

00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:43,139
lines line like in the oval office at

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,199
the white house there is a right

00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:49,710
telephone because you know who is

00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:53,550
calling at the telephone but you're

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:58,379
always addressing the Oval Office not

00:05:53,550 --> 00:06:00,719
directly the president what is the

00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:05,090
difference what has happened today we

00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:12,900
have portables so addressing people not

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:16,379
houses and so we don't need the white

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,900
papers to address houses and internal

00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:22,159
threads so the ended of threads it is

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:28,500
instead of giving advices to interface

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:32,020
we embed the networking we can embed we

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,990
are not forced to if we can have

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:43,919
the opportunity to embed the networking

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:54,340
networking support into processes why I

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:58,240
listed here a number of I think hard

00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:02,080
problems for example if you want to

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:06,430
provide a specific address a specific

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,759
address to a specific user you can you

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:14,830
can create as you can give one more

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:17,680
address to your interface and then you

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,110
have to play with iptables to divert the

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,250
traffic to data process and so on you

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,960
can but it's not natural if you want to

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,990
provide different quality of service

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,030
differently routing for different

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:34,860
processes if want to run in cellular

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:37,930
service on the same interface +

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,050
port-a-potty is like a play week so

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:44,139
easily so it has a number and then you

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:47,080
have the extension if you decided that

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:51,279
to the extension number one is for is

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:55,750
for the boss like we decide that the

00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:58,469
sock number 80 is for wet but it's okay

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:02,860
provided you don't have two bosses

00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:06,130
otherwise you don't know who write

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:12,520
cosine the number 121 instead of the

00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:16,210
other so they start fighting is equipe e

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:21,389
answer or you can address the slide my

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:26,380
great processes is another hard problem

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:31,330
why because we have ipv6 so we have

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:35,169
plaintiff addresses so doing this in a

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:38,349
play for can be hard because we have to

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:43,240
count others this one by one because of

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:44,880
their scars but in a particular can use

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,290
it and given we have

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,470
many addresses we can return back to

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:57,650
choke and black Wars to redesign a new

00:08:52,470 --> 00:09:01,860
internet and we must find a way to too

00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:05,160
we must find the reason to think to a

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:10,200
creator or I PVA because we are

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:15,540
developers only people were thinking to

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:19,740
Anson traumen Alison think is EXA to

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:26,520
name 10 ok I've heard about an operating

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:31,410
system but ok ok I heard about the

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:33,570
Internet of Things and they're flat so

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:37,460
they do not flirt with a softer

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:39,930
counterpart of the Internet of Things so

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,080
albariño is a wonderful piece of

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:49,350
hardware is too limited the so you have

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:55,980
to reprogram it to flash it again to

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:58,680
have the Arduino do another job so in

00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:02,100
some senses special purpose in the same

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:06,270
way they rob it Robbie to rubbish rabbit

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:10,050
are quite special purposes they are just

00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,670
toys and as soon as the you wanted to

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,890
change the service you wanted to change

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:18,180
something here to throw them away by a

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:24,960
new version it's what it was what they

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:28,740
would be hardware vendors want now

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:33,080
however we are going to have more

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:38,340
powerful hardware like the Raspberry Pi

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:41,370
so we can do what we are doing where is

00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:45,570
the internals of things in terms of

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:50,810
software so we have internet of software

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,810
things I mean internet or floods

00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:58,209
why you say we have linux containers you

00:10:55,699 --> 00:11:02,589
can give addresses like linux containers

00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:05,480
that's true but it's it's another story

00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:08,749
these containers are for system

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:13,579
administrators to provide services to

00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:17,300
users internet wats is for users so

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:21,139
users must be should be able to define

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:26,660
their IP address to reload the network

00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:32,889
traffic without the need of root access

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,889
all of being a sysadmin of the machine

00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:43,819
obviously are not written Firefox yet

00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:46,699
but I imagine that in the future there

00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:50,569
can be that the way to choose the

00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:53,660
network as we choose the printer now so

00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:57,069
you can have a man you saying oh I want

00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:01,430
I want to see the network through that

00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:04,550
we can all the other because it's up to

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:08,269
the user to the side IP addresses and

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:12,939
working and because it's a natural way

00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:16,790
to do networks I will try to tie

00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:20,899
interface it Kate together you need some

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:24,949
kind of warps wires or threads so a

00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:30,379
network even in the common behavior and

00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:34,750
the common idea is made up of something

00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:34,750
that can be tied together lectroids

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:44,209
these are the examples that hopefully i

00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:46,220
will show you today browser providing

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:49,009
different perspectives on the network so

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,569
it started as a browser and they move

00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:54,740
the browser in different countries

00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:58,999
without even restarting the browser and

00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:03,310
i'll put everything as a user now root

00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:10,260
access little princess and so that's the

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:13,720
server part itzel am these are servers

00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,150
with the networking attached so you can

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,640
migrate service just by killing a

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:22,540
process of one machine and starting the

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,029
process on the other no configuration of

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:29,710
the interface now we're routing nothing

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:33,700
of what it it yesterday oh this is they

00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:38,050
did a new point i'm presenting this for

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:41,170
the first time one time IP address you

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:44,880
know one time password one time i played

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:49,990
us sometimes I get worried at all

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:55,900
because somebody try to enter my sister

00:13:49,990 --> 00:14:01,390
that try to provide to to put in place

00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:06,430
brute force attack or maybe on SSH maybe

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:10,860
on my VoIP system SSH roper my own

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:13,990
services so I don't want the other two I

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:17,860
want to be able to access my service but

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:21,550
they are they'll just for me so I can

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:25,060
use the same idea of one time passer and

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:30,250
I can change the address in the example

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:33,280
I will change it every 64 seconds so

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:39,280
that even if somebody is looking at the

00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:42,210
traffic on the nettles or listening to

00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:45,700
the network is using white shark and

00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:53,380
guess there are some addresses they are

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:58,000
useless in 64 seconds so before having a

00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:05,020
look of the demos what's behind the what

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,900
behind the stage we need a number of

00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:11,260
technologies but luckily we have

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:15,760
developed them the first one is the

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,370
network so if you have processes which

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,120
are

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,880
network nodes it's how to connect one

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,520
piece of software like a process to an

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,250
advil switch so you need a software

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,610
switch that is able to connect the

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,400
software processes and Vee well to this

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:41,060
view the ethernet provides this kind of

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:46,700
switch so the network the network enters

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:52,339
into the logical part of the machine so

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:59,300
the processes can get connected to the

00:15:52,339 --> 00:16:02,270
virtual switches we can use all the

00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:05,660
standard stuff for over standard tools

00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:07,339
we use on physical networks for

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,100
processes for example we can ask

00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:13,760
processes to acquire their address by

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:19,580
ipv6 auto configuration or by the ACP

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:23,029
like usual you can set up a hybrid

00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:26,959
networks networks that are partly real

00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:30,080
partly virtual and from the outside you

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:37,180
are not able to distinguish between real

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:37,180
nodes and virtual nodes and flats host

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:48,080
little square biz as a community that

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:51,910
has created all this all these tools del

00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:55,550
of tools we are using let me skip these

00:16:51,910 --> 00:17:02,810
disorders advertisement or if you read

00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:06,280
the interview I have a kind of childhood

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:10,429
trauma about building sets or I had the

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,490
incompatible building sets so that's why

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:17,140
today I am creating ways to integrate

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,140
different with qualities

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:26,659
ok that's just advertising oh let me get

00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:30,350
better we have where to disputed a donut

00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:33,830
that we needed the stack to embed the

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:37,669
networking into the threads and this is

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:40,100
our stack lwp v6 is a stack cousin

00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:43,759
entire stack implemented as a library it

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:48,460
is ipv4 ipv6 it's maybe it means that

00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:53,840
there is Jose and forwarding engine and

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:55,850
we have bureau which is a partial

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,529
virtual machine support it means that

00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,720
you have a virtual machine that can

00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:02,539
visualize just file system just aren't

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,840
working and so on a week I think it's

00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:12,100
better to to have a look at the of all

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:16,549
this tool by looking them at work so

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:19,909
they'll start for with the first them I

00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:24,259
need your imagination and as you can see

00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:28,539
as you will see I don't like icons so

00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:31,250
you see a lot of common line comments

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:38,139
common line interface so you have to

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:38,139
imagine what is happening behind so

00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:47,750
first example so let us have a look of

00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:51,679
the example I start a browser the

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:56,269
browser is connected to nature and the

00:18:51,679 --> 00:19:00,409
browser is Firefox but is using our lwp

00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:03,799
v6 or stack because it's running into a

00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:07,250
virtual machine it is connected to a

00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:09,649
radius rachel and i use everyday airport

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:13,460
on the other end I mean that's a process

00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:17,330
that is a stable process for the hosting

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:24,500
machine and it's a router for the

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:27,379
virtual network will provide dsl as ok a

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,539
dynamically linked executable but also

00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:30,500
as a static link execute oh so you can

00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:34,350
just

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,720
bring this executable copying the word

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,600
machine that you want to use as your

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:46,350
default route and as a user you water

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:52,590
your traffic to that machine okay let's

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:58,850
sort in this window on the left is just

00:19:52,590 --> 00:20:03,210
a list of Commons I start the slip vide

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:06,990
luckily I start the virtual machine here

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:10,490
I hope it's not too too too small the

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:14,760
font because can you eat from the back

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:21,780
yes know yet whether her raise your hand

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:25,710
yes sir laser hand know and my god ok

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:29,040
I'll try to have the font vehicle just

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,620
on the terminals were I ensuring

00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:37,440
something very interesting because

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:48,390
otherwise all the windows can fit to the

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:51,060
screen so here there is the slip VD now

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:58,560
till the virtual machine and there is an

00:20:51,060 --> 00:21:01,230
activator machine ok now I I say to this

00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:07,190
vector machine virtualize networking and

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:07,190
file system so now I have my real

00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:19,530
because I'm in the Metro machine now I

00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:22,530
want to talk just to check if I am I'm

00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:25,200
out of the network layer of the rail

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:29,390
network so that that's that's matter

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,390
that's matters for direct for

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:40,130
just a minute I I bring down and up the

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:47,230
wild life the the wireless it's a

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:52,840
problem with the wireless okay Thomas

00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:58,280
there is not related in any way with

00:21:52,840 --> 00:22:01,940
okay yeah I think we had a problem on

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:05,990
the wireless net too I using the

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:11,450
wireless not in there in the Roman is it

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:31,100
working for you Oh No who says no

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:33,620
because I have received an IP address ok

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,370
Tommy cross your fingers please

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,370
everybody

00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:52,159
I tried this before okay it's up above

00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:57,229
its okay its up its up well okay let's

00:22:52,159 --> 00:23:01,759
go on so we were at this point now i

00:22:57,229 --> 00:23:03,830
start the realtor networking I bring up

00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:08,450
the interface as you can see I have

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:11,779
different interfaces now because now the

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,999
network answer is real or not real so I

00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:17,809
little out the the file system just

00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:19,609
because unfortunately the information

00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,059
about the domain name server is in a

00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:24,859
file so i have to retro at the atc

00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:28,729
resolve that call file that's really

00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:30,159
nice for having a bit of virtual partial

00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:33,469
virtual machines because i can visualize

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:39,109
justified i say that file is written so

00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:41,839
i can bring the network apple okay I've

00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:52,969
gotten a dresser and now I can start the

00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:56,389
fire oxen and hopefully you okay there

00:23:52,969 --> 00:24:04,599
is a black I'm looking for but the

00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:11,440
second time it's it's the shop okay so

00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:14,239
because your fingers at the networking

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,960
let us save the rail network user is

00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,960
still working

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:44,510
okay it's working the nurse the nice

00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:48,330
part of a of the damage the dot a

00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:56,760
colossal let us reply it from the

00:24:48,330 --> 00:25:07,460
scratch maybe large forms have put to

00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:25,770
the system in trouble okay this does

00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:28,350
this does ok and now firefox yeah okay

00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:37,140
we are in belgium and you know we are

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:39,780
here but now i try to to connect the

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:46,800
cable from lime with a stretch to sleep

00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:55,010
led in vilonia hopefully please please

00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:58,280
please ok university of bologna bother

00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,280
we can

00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:11,660
working over now now I like to I like

00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:20,820
the game so never try too hard to walk

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:24,740
here okay it works it worth one sir 90

00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:31,230
okay let us move to the second example

00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:33,180
okay that's Kansas City okay but we have

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:36,360
seen this example that was moved to the

00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:42,440
other example i hope the networking is

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:47,180
following me the network be with me ok

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:54,240
so now I connected the network to

00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:57,810
Bologna and with a VD switch which if

00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:02,340
connected to the internet and I started

00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:04,410
there so there is a contiki holster you

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,440
are not continue all many of you have

00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:10,200
heard about Kentucky continuing is an

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,080
embedded system is a operating system

00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,340
for a better system here I've created a

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:23,130
virtual embedded system so all the web

00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:31,040
server the whole web server is 140 k so

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:38,370
but I show you this first these are a

00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:42,660
standard browser ok I'm connected to my

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:45,300
web server but I hope you will not find

00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:49,080
too many butter if you try you can reach

00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:52,560
my this very web server typing the day

00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,650
would they it's an IP address because

00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:59,370
I'm on the network I'm on the internet

00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:02,910
but the process is here it's internet of

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:09,420
thread server side there is Kentucky but

00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:11,100
I can do the same using our lwp sorry

00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,830
I'm turning off

00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:17,850
web service or if you tried okay

00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:21,330
otherwise it's don't tell it is not

00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:32,580
working control C and the server's

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:43,380
disappears okay now let me try this

00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:48,870
duster ok now I've started a another

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:53,460
service on on 42 okay there's a rittle

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:55,860
nasuh efendi a way to a web server I

00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,710
think that in the future can becames

00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:02,580
littleness so instead of having a hard

00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:05,390
master networker the boxer you you buy

00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:09,299
for your home to connector your

00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:13,049
computers there's a the real to a

00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:21,049
counterpart so it's a web server it

00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:26,520
works it works now we can do something

00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:29,159
like this I I need to open several

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:33,929
windows the first one i connect to

00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:48,169
Bologna and from Bologna I connect a

00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:52,309
switch in UK I need the password ok and

00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:52,309
now I connected to

00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:08,960
to my rear to machine in the UK tests

00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:12,470
what up playas tester and now i control

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:16,880
see the server here and start the server

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:20,050
there I load the page and is already

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:24,500
running but I move to the server from

00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:26,450
here from my laptop today ok because the

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,610
server has of the networking stack

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:34,580
embedded so i can have the that yeah

00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:41,540
instead of reconfiguring the network you

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:50,570
can just start the process and now this

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:56,090
was the demo number two now all the

00:30:50,570 --> 00:31:00,710
prompts the most difficult one has sent

00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:06,830
to be at the circus ok Who am I an elf

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:10,120
hunter ok one time I p what's a one-time

00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:13,580
IP you know one time password I

00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:16,730
explained so you use the same mean to

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:20,060
have your private to us the architecture

00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:24,260
I'll set up at this I'm i have my

00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:28,300
browser unfortunately a FIFO queue is

00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:34,010
not able to understand the URL including

00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:38,240
passwords so I've created a syntax if

00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:41,420
you have the name of the horse name

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,180
underscore underscore a password that's

00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:48,020
an extended URL we can decide and future

00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:53,650
to to have a better syntax but I want to

00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:57,940
show the idea fabric is not able to

00:31:53,650 --> 00:32:06,119
translate this kind of dresses I also a

00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:09,389
DNS forwarder so firefox give the ass

00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:13,739
the query to the DNS which is the DNS

00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:17,719
for order the DNS for order is able to

00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:23,789
parse the new syntax it takes the

00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:28,549
hostname and ask the four day from an IP

00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:36,689
address ipv6 address to the rail dienes

00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:41,149
it gets the the answer and compute the

00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:45,809
actual address by combining three things

00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:49,349
the the base the base address the

00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:54,049
password and the current time it took

00:32:49,349 --> 00:33:01,559
computers the hash and the hash a day

00:32:54,049 --> 00:33:03,749
lower 64 bits part of the dress on the

00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:07,919
other side I have a switch and I have a

00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:12,179
server which is able to jump from an

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:17,279
address to the other on the reality IP

00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:20,129
addresses last IP addresses last for 128

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:24,739
seconds because the validity of an

00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:28,709
address begins 32 second in advance and

00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:31,559
terminate 32 second late so that if

00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:34,649
there are inconsistencies drift were

00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:39,449
four in the clock so we can manage them

00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:43,049
in the evenin the real internet 32

00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:50,399
second is a geological era if you have

00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:54,479
ntp and the other point is TCP sometimes

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:58,859
has a long lasting connection if you

00:33:54,479 --> 00:34:06,179
have an ssh connection it can stays on

00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:10,139
for hours that a dresser remain valid

00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:14,129
just for that connection and the

00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:17,099
listening port is switched off gets

00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:20,010
switched off so no more connection to

00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:25,090
that address are allowed

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:28,470
but I'm not giving just add restless I'm

00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:32,500
just I'm really starting and stopping

00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:36,370
entire stacks so I start a stack I

00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:39,610
provide I configured the interpreter

00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:44,460
will train taffeta dresses and after 120

00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,460
sent 28 seconds I switch off the stack

00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:56,040
that's right okay let us close all the

00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,040
other stuff return back to the beginning

00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:10,020
so okay disqus turn

00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:32,630
I'm not realizing anything yet so let me

00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:35,569
see if we have no problem with the

00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:39,609
network now the network is okay so why

00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:42,230
I'm not to resolving this IP address so

00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:57,109
this is not virtualization there is a

00:35:42,230 --> 00:36:02,109
real networking it seems we are in

00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:02,109
trouble with dns

00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:20,720
I have trouble with the DNS here of our

00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:22,790
false them because i'll try to bring the

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,940
networking down and up again to see if

00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:27,940
something is working better

00:36:51,950 --> 00:37:12,890
okay please since that how can come out

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:19,460
of this that the dns works for you yeah

00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:33,020
but i need an open dns server you have

00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:35,410
one solid dot 88 okay so thanks a lot

00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,410
guys

00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:13,050
went up ATM there is a quarter okay

00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:22,230
thanks a lot okay did the base address

00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:22,230
little base address of that way is now

00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:37,330
the real DNS is not able to parse these

00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:44,070
addresses obviously so we can okay

00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:44,070
virtualize we can virtualize a processor

00:38:46,140 --> 00:39:00,030
we can further modify it as a user it is

00:38:52,060 --> 00:39:07,060
Cyril sought comfort and move as a user

00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:11,620
the name server to be one private

00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:14,650
address and then I start to I need more

00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:25,660
windows no no no it's nothing in that

00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:35,500
sense i can start my dns for water which

00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:41,920
is here now i forward it to 8888 okay

00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:46,180
now from within this virtual machine the

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:50,350
old address is mapped to a normal dress

00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:54,690
but the new dress with password as come

00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:58,420
as computed okay wonderful as computed

00:39:54,690 --> 00:40:04,660
the current address so if i return back

00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:12,069
in 64 second that

00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:19,200
say okay in a while it changes but we

00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:19,200
can start a web server here having a

00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:46,539
okay i can use this tests web test now i

00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:49,530
start this here as you can see has

00:40:46,539 --> 00:41:01,390
change it the address but now i can

00:40:49,530 --> 00:41:05,500
start my firefox or okay and I can okay

00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:09,880
I this is my website if I reload the

00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:15,210
page for a while I can navigate it I can

00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:20,470
enter the file I can reload the page

00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:25,180
reload reload to reload actually this is

00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:28,750
online so if you are able to transcript

00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:40,720
the long ipv6 address you can reach the

00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:50,380
very same web server don't try too many

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:54,220
otherwise in a while okay exchange

00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:57,339
address but we are still online so this

00:41:54,220 --> 00:42:00,430
is one time I p you can have your server

00:41:57,339 --> 00:42:04,000
changing dynamically the address but if

00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:06,510
you are legitimate user you can follow

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:15,130
the change of that rest of your server

00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:17,859
okay you can do this on a real network

00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,580
you can do it is on private natural for

00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:23,920
example we have

00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:27,640
of public VD switches so you can connect

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:33,970
to this public switch and you can create

00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:36,490
a worldwide local area network because

00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:39,460
it is worldwide but it's not connected

00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:44,250
to the internet so I give you a

00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:48,850
suggestion imagine it for you if you

00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:52,420
write a bit torrent tracker that is able

00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:59,500
to change its address from one place to

00:42:52,420 --> 00:43:04,830
another and it's inside a virtual net

00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:08,860
virtual LAN I legitimately users or

00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:13,000
people who don't want you to freely

00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:22,210
express your opinion for them it's hard

00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:27,550
to track your service down okay so what

00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:32,110
about security we have the principle of

00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:34,960
least privilege it's process must be

00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:39,730
given no more privileges than necessary

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:42,820
to do its job and I don't know if it's

00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:47,590
always considered ended in the right way

00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:54,130
for example we're over using this is

00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:56,560
that capabilities I don't know it

00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:59,680
happens to me it happened to me that I

00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:03,610
think it happened to all the system

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:07,990
administrator to type RM a file and as

00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:11,860
soon as you entered the enter key and

00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:14,500
push the enter key if you start

00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:20,680
wondering but which what the directory

00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:26,710
was okay so being rude to too much too

00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:31,870
long it's dangerous by itself so putting

00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:34,880
the services outside the creating

00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:38,150
given the use of the freedom due to

00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:43,570
create their services by themselves it

00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:47,170
means to have a more solid system more

00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:50,450
we will discuss in the afternoon in the

00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:56,030
virtualization and cloud the room about

00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:59,150
this topic if you have a lot of services

00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:01,700
in the colonel you have a huge kernel

00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:05,330
with a lot of services and that there is

00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:08,600
a famous theorem that says the larger is

00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:14,150
the code the most probable is to have

00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:20,330
box and as this relation is more than

00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:24,590
linear so this was the wat water and

00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:28,190
attainable set to Lena stavas micro

00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:33,560
kernels are better so if you are able to

00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:36,560
put services outside the colonel we can

00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:39,050
have a more flexible system my point and

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,290
it will the point i will discuss in the

00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:44,930
afternoon it that we can have Milley

00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:51,020
kernels so neither colonel not

00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:54,560
microkernel in people from net bsd two

00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:57,620
are talking about Anakin is a is quite

00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:01,550
the same concept so a candidate can be

00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:04,460
configured to be a monolithic kernel a

00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:07,910
microkernel or monolithic 4cyl services

00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:13,630
a microkernel for others up to the

00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:24,790
sysadmin needs ok so one word about

00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:29,330
performance ok it it is heavier to have

00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:32,930
to have stacks outside the colonel so if

00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:36,230
you do benchmarking for sure the kinetic

00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:40,040
wins but do you remember the first

00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:43,330
portable phones they were you to wear it

00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,970
during the time if the service is useful

00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:52,250
we provide a better

00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:55,640
support that's my point we can't think

00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:59,390
just to perform answer we have to open

00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:01,940
our minds and think to what's useful and

00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:05,570
then we can find out the right support

00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:08,690
to provide performance VD there is a

00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:20,540
kind implementation vide and it's quite

00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:26,140
faster we have not yet written or found

00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:29,030
a way to to use a staggered kernel level

00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:34,550
network stacks are ordinary business for

00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:39,290
users interprocess communication in the

00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:41,030
cloud is done by processes so this is

00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:44,150
the way to the inter process

00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:49,280
communication if you are thinking too in

00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:52,119
a cloud way that's all thank you there

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,119
are questions

00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:20,000
laser dot two points about this if the

00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:27,680
question is xst four bits enough for

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:32,000
security in a probabilistic sensor it's

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:36,820
1 over 2 to the 64th of the probability

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,820
whoever to get the right address and

00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:48,110
even if the entire internet today which

00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:50,810
is which is a mapped on 32 bits so the

00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:56,210
maximum number of horses you can have is

00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:59,630
two to the 32 is on one single oral

00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:09,020
local area network the probability to

00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:14,060
have a collision is less than 1 over 2

00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:16,220
to the 31 because we have two times the

00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:19,880
number of space because each one can

00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:26,960
collect collide with another so it's

00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:29,840
quite rare one over for billions if the

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,050
entire internet is on 11 I think it's

00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,050
enough

00:49:50,929 --> 00:50:01,229
we're working on glad to I know there

00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:02,939
are there are troubles so for the number

00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:06,119
of nodes sir but we have also

00:50:02,939 --> 00:50:09,349
technologies they're not inside because

00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:13,380
we can't cope with the standard the

00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:16,019
minimum spanning tree but there are

00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:21,809
software-defined networks there are

00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:26,039
there is a 802.1 a queue protocol that

00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:31,709
can be used we are envisioning ways to

00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:44,069
to take care of that problem too last

00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:48,649
question that was the slightly about

00:50:44,069 --> 00:50:51,839
containers names network names phases

00:50:48,649 --> 00:50:57,329
where for system administrators more

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:59,489
than usual so it's not having the net

00:50:57,329 --> 00:51:01,889
that the network stack in bed another

00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:03,929
night nice point to have the network

00:51:01,889 --> 00:51:08,339
stack embedded is that if you want to

00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:12,839
migrate a process imagine that you have

00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:15,479
a real working freezer that to to to to

00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:21,599
stop a process here and we started there

00:51:15,479 --> 00:51:23,819
at keeping the state if the your

00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,329
networking state is in the car you have

00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:30,839
to pick up all the information about

00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:33,389
your connections and save it and move it

00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:38,909
to instead if it's inside the process is

00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:40,969
the natural way to do it okay thank you

00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:40,969
a lot

00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:51,760
and sorry for the problems in the demo

00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,760
