	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
this is actually my very first trip to

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,509
Europe my name is Linda keightley and

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm going to be talking about alumium

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,960
today and goes hello thank you this is

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,990
actually going to end up going in my

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:24,119
pocket and so last night I worked really

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:28,189
hard to get a our first distro of a

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:32,880
Lumia out we have if you go to lumen org

00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:34,649
you can download a loom Ian I don't know

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,840
if you'll want to or not by the time I'm

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,840
done talking here so I'm going to talk

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,590
about where Leumi inque mum and where we

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,870
wanted to go from here um I'm actually

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,920
so Linda keightley oh you want to do

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,840
slides for me too wow sweet I actually

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,149
come from son I never had a slide guy

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,879
when I was there even at Oracle with the

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,600
big bucks I didn't get a slide guy it's

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,180
too bad um so I'm actually employed by a

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,830
company called nexenta and Nick Senta

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,830
was one of the few companies that when

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,260
son open-source the opensolaris colonel

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,869
they took advantage of that and so they

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,350
built out a distribution there were two

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,640
guys in they built a distribution and

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,830
they thought you know what would make

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,680
open solaris interesting is making it

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,630
user kind of user friendly to the Linux

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,790
guys and the guys who started our

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,890
company are actually guys that put back

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,530
the ice guzzi stack into the Linux

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,909
kernel and they were debian guys right

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,799
there were you bun two guys and they

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,079
they were kind of intrigued by open

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,210
solaris and they said you know what can

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,579
we what can we do with open solaris it

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,340
makes it more for them right it's more

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,930
easy for us to use and what they did

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,460
with it was they took the open solaris

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,890
kernel and they added the debian

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:57,000
packaging on top of it very quickly they

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:59,090
produced a very large community at my

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,680
disposal I have a database of over

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,750
30,000 email addresses of people that

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,759
had downloaded nexenta at some point in

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:11,520
time since naked since 2005 so yeah it

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,980
was it was started as just a desktop

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,530
distribution based

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,530
you bunt to wanted to be able to have

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,980
the power of a solaris kernel with the

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,230
user land of Debian to make it easier to

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,620
use for people to transition or to move

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:31,069
over and into that environment they

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,799
quickly found that supporting an

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:36,620
operating system isn't a business that

00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:39,110
they wanted to get into they didn't want

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,299
to they didn't want to become canonical

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:45,650
right they didn't want to do that kind

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:48,920
of business so when when the ZFS

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,440
filesystem was put back into the open

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,629
solaris they looked at that as an

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,670
opportunity to build storage appliance

00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:57,530
and that's all I'm going to talk really

00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,060
about next enta is that they built a

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,060
storage appliance of a small business

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,569
and the business is growing right now we

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:08,560
groped four hundred percent last year

00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:11,329
you know based on this this kind of idea

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,160
but you know prior to that or you know

00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:15,410
as they built this desktop team they

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,049
they really wanted to create a great

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:21,590
server platform we had this thing called

00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:24,799
an extended core platform we just had

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,810
our last run of Nick centocor our

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,950
primary purpose for a loom ian is to

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:33,319
find a replacement for next centocor

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,840
next slide so this is a very short

00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,400
history one of the nice things about the

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,400
solaris colonel though is it has a long

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,400
history it's about a 30 year old kernel

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,709
that son open sourced it's got a lot of

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,510
nice features in it it's got dtrace it's

00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,700
got the ZFS filesystem in it it's got

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,739
fault management service management a

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,579
lot of enterprise functionality and

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:57,410
features built into this core kernel so

00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:58,519
next Senta back to make sense I said

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,030
that was all I was going to talk about

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,799
Nick Senta was that they the whole the

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,560
whole company was based on the open

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:09,319
solaris kernel and so they they built up

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,299
the ZFS filesystem into an appliance a

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,760
software appliance that you could put on

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:16,880
commodity hardware and have enterprise

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,260
storage a couple years later son

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,750
actually came out with a product that

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,370
looked a lot awful lot like it because

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,340
they were like two guys in their dog

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,900
they didn't I don't think they ever

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,350
tried to sue song

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,880
stealing their idea but no just kidding

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,250
that was just a joke this isn't being

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:39,830
broadcast is it I'm not going to get in

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:41,360
trouble yeah okay so we also had you

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,729
know the DTrace built-in if you're not

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,360
familiar with what DTrace does DTrace is

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:50,539
in the kernel there's like on my laptop

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,550
there's 30,000 probes that I can fire

00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:55,910
off into different parts of the kernel

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,229
and get analytical data from it saudi

00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,560
trace is actually a scripting language

00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:03,620
that's combined with the probes and then

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,780
a scripting utility so that you can do

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,360
some analysis of of the data that you're

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,660
seeing at those points you can fire off

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,910
all 30,000 probes if you want but you

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,330
will get a massive quantity of data back

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,550
right so they they built DTrace to allow

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,410
you to parse through the data and then

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,419
present it in whatever kind of format

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,940
you want so DTrace basically is a

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:28,550
scripting language we use a lot of

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,990
DTrace even still at nick's enta to see

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,210
what's going on inside of the file

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,419
system see what going on inside of the

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,280
applications there's also zone zones

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,280
allow you to have a very lightweight

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,310
virtualization environment very little

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,220
very lightweight zone on my laptop boots

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,080
in point 1 seconds so it's a very

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,909
lightweight development environment

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,020
looks like an operating system has an IP

00:05:49,909 --> 00:06:00,169
address and you know looks as if it's a

00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:02,930
full running operating system so as time

00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:05,090
went on nexenta maintained their own

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,240
separate set of patches separate from

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,520
the open solaris colonel when sun was

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,099
writing open solaris it wasn't it wasn't

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,710
really easy to get putbacks put back

00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:19,000
into that colonel so they maintain their

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:21,530
own set of patches for their product and

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,460
2008 was when they started selling it as

00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:27,740
a product but they also had a very very

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,440
mature I scuzzy stacked just because

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,510
they were you know the I scuzzy guys and

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,130
they had that much earlier than the

00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:39,660
opensolaris colonel had that so then to

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,420
fit in to the Debian model

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,360
um they took and repackaged everything

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:49,320
up in the Deb format and then took all

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,110
the kernel packages and you know left

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:58,350
the Sun name on them and just know you

00:06:52,110 --> 00:07:04,530
could apt-get install sun w ZF s get it

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:07,140
that way so the the first few you know

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:10,860
up until version 3 of nexenta core

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:15,560
platform the packages were were based on

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:18,300
the ubuntu eight packages we got over

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,340
13,000 of those packages in a repo we

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,100
also had tools for automation to take

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,930
the Debian packages directly and and you

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,810
know convert them ever so slightly to

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,670
run in this this distribution built up a

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,300
very large community around this and

00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:35,220
built out all these packages you know

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,230
put some enhancements into some of the

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,090
core server packages that that we were

00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:43,170
using for our product including changes

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:47,460
to apache mysql and then added support

00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:51,470
for the SMF in our own utilities and so

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:57,860
looks like apt any other apt right um

00:07:51,470 --> 00:08:01,220
next ok so then some things happened and

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:05,010
that's all the technology part of it but

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:07,560
even as open solaris so i actually am a

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:11,370
son engineer i was a sales engineer for

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,500
sun and as soon as we open solaris there

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,180
was a lot of controversy around it you

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
know why are they doing this why is it

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,700
out there why you know where they're

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,370
going to take contributions what are

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:25,950
they doing and there was always a large

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:28,410
amount of controversy and you know it it

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:35,160
when it first went out it looked like

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:40,740
Solaris it had a CDE desktop in it it

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:43,740
had no utilities for wireless so when

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:47,089
was it about two thousand six or so the

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,339
Sun VP's went out and hired a guy to get

00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:53,050
get open solaris to be more user

00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:56,730
friendly for end users

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,990
he sat down with a guy in Indiana and

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,480
asked him what were the problems that

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,760
Solaris had to be more user-friendly or

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,490
to be you know more like you buy two or

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,760
more like some of these linux

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,680
distributions that guy was Ian Murdock I

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,290
guess he sat down with him for about six

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,630
hours and said what's wrong and Ian

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,490
talked for like six hours and then the

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,140
next day he went out and hired him and

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,579
he said hey all that stuff that you told

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,700
me that was wrong with solaris will you

00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:28,860
come here and fix it so it even came to

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:33,010
Sun in an effort to make a desktop

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:36,760
environment that was easy to use for

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,860
developers to use and that was the basis

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,070
for the open solaris distro and it also

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,589
is the basis for solaris 11 if you see I

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,300
PS if you know apt and you see IPS the

00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:48,640
package management system inside of

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,660
Solaris it'll look real familiar to you

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:55,420
right it's IPS install package name so

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,240
very very similar got it a kind of

00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,100
grown-up desktop got it gnome put some

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,880
tools in there some utilities to make it

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,709
user-friendly on on small x86 appliances

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,480
that's one of the things that not a lot

00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:09,310
of people know is that you know solaris

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,100
on x86 ran just as good as it did on

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,620
sparc as we move forward all the

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,660
development around illumos is in the x86

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,370
space we just really don't have any

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,220
interest in spark we have no investment

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:24,630
in spark hardware and I'll okay I'll get

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:28,480
more to illumise as we move forward um

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:32,680
so then oracle came and I was a son

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,649
employee when Oracle came in as as they

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,810
started to come we were told that they

00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,220
plan to keep all the communities intact

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,670
they were going to let us just run our

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,500
business the way that we always ran it

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:48,180
but but what actually happened was the

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:51,519
open solaris community was abandoned and

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,410
oracle had no investment in the open

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,180
source community there was no plan to

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,399
continue the opensolaris community there

00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,199
was no plan to continue one of the

00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,329
things that opens leurs it was trying to

00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,339
do was open development so cooperative

00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:05,250
open development with end-users and

00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:07,290
anybody in the community

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:12,420
all of that went to came to an abrupt

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:14,280
halt so it went it went dead you know

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,270
the communication from Oracle from

00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:21,390
engineers within Oracle just went dead

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,590
and so companies like Nick Santa sitting

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,030
on the outside there's an accent oh

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,680
there's joint there's Delphic some

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,740
people that had built companies around

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,890
this open sewers colonel weren't sure

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,960
what to do at this point because the the

00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,120
communication had gone silent that when

00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,240
they'd ask anybody actually I was a I

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,360
was a engineer at the time and they said

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:47,100
to me that as an engineer your job is

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,320
not to discuss strategy with people so I

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,360
was I was told that I could answer

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,390
technical questions but not strategic

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:59,310
questions so we knew very quickly that

00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:01,320
something odd had happened so when this

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,540
happened a lot of the colonel engineers

00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,510
a lot of the sales engineers a lot of

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,720
the support engineers left it just

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,160
wasn't a good situation I have two

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,380
little kids at home so I couldn't just

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,150
leave I would have liked to have just

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,460
left like some of the other ones just up

00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,530
and left but kind of had to wait around

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,480
until I found something else but those

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,339
all those colonel engineers left kind of

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,560
in mass but a lot of them still really

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,860
love Solaris and love the core operating

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,600
system that they had worked on and many

00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,050
of them so there's the you know the next

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,420
enta joy in every city Dell fix all

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:41,540
companies that had had built businesses

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:44,160
around this core operating system and

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,620
many of them were disappointed and me

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,300
too i think the saddest day of my life

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,330
was the day when i went to son calm and

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,940
it said oracle com it just was a very

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,710
very sad i was saying to the guys on the

00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,300
way over here in the car I didn't cry

00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,580
when my kids were born but I cried that

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:06,030
day what I had to see the big red splash

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:08,730
on my beloved son so next page so what

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,980
happened so we knew that we knew the

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,200
colonel was open right i mean the the

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,290
core kernel was open there were a bunch

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,170
of real

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:22,240
a kind of clergy closed bits that we

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:28,690
needed to make the colonel installable

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:30,970
or freely or fully a full colonel so

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,459
next one's actually funded the opening

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:37,690
and the development of illumos in august

00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:39,850
of 2010 so that the engineers so our

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:44,019
engineers could write those clothes bits

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:46,930
and and create a fully open tree of open

00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:49,899
solaris so what's left of open solaris

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:54,120
now lives in illumos so loomis org has

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:57,339
been alive since august of 2010 in that

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,680
all the key components are opened in

00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,060
that there's been some distributions

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,319
that have opened there have been some

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:07,209
Forks that have taken place the probably

00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:10,240
the most well-known distribution is the

00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:11,709
open indiana distribution which isn't

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,740
just the core kernel but it's a whole

00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:17,560
distribution it uses the IPS packaging

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,930
system and has a gnome desktop has has

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:24,519
all of the the nice utilities from

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:27,760
solaris 11 so we had all of these other

00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,470
guys contributing into this community so

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,839
now the community is about what a year

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,000
and a half old we have funding that they

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,949
can send I don't know why they send a

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,139
chubby girl from Minnesota out here to

00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:40,569
Russell's to talk to you about illumos

00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:42,610
but we can do stuff like that now right

00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:45,339
we have if you come over to our booth we

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,860
have some free t-shirts to give away we

00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:52,329
have we have enough momentum we have

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,339
enough participation that even if you

00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:55,750
know even if one of these players pulled

00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,639
out of illumise it wouldn't really

00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,269
matter because there's enough there's a

00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,560
triangle and there's enough people

00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:06,610
participating in this this core

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:10,199
community to to keep it going and to

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,399
keep keep it going probably perpetually

00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,529
what we're looking for now we're looking

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,009
for more contributors it the nice thing

00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:19,300
about is is a fairly small community if

00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:21,399
you're looking to contribute code

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,620
somewhere contribute documentation

00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,160
contribute packaging contribute you know

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,990
anything in an open open source project

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,910
is a great place to be you have some

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,110
very senior engineers that will mentor

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:37,149
and you know help help you create things

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,680
we also have really good partnerships

00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:41,230
with some other communities like the

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,350
freebsd community is is doing a lot in

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:49,060
the ZFS area where they're putting back

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:51,459
fixes changes bug bugs into back into

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:56,970
the core illumos colonel we have

00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:59,199
partnerships with and even the few times

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,810
it took me a minute for my brain to

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,220
catch up with my mouth and so we also

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,439
have partnerships with like the guys

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,060
that are doing fuse on linux and there

00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:09,160
when they're finding bugs when they're

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,569
finding changes or fixes that need to be

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,399
done they're putting them back into

00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:19,660
Alamos so that the whole community is

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:22,779
able to benefit from those changes there

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:26,500
are a number of so off the top of my

00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:28,089
head I know of six and I don't know why

00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,670
they always call them a super stealth

00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:33,130
startup but I know of six other super

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,959
stealth startups around the illumos

00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:38,709
community that are putting back code and

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,199
using this code in either OEM products

00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:42,790
or application based products on top of

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,029
this kernel so there's a lot of

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,009
participation oddly enough there's some

00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:50,170
big money coming into it too to make

00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:56,019
sure that it stays and it continues to

00:16:50,170 --> 00:17:01,480
stay forever so next so oh gosh I had a

00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:03,519
slide for this so um came from Sun

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,140
didn't like what happened at Oracle so

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,659
we you know we have some edicts in the

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:12,309
community you know things like no bike

00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:14,380
shedding no you know we call it a

00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,669
meritocracy if you have code or if you

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,159
have something you want to contribute we

00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:19,630
just you know have you contribute we

00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:24,579
don't like a lot of discussion we don't

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:27,010
like a lot of chatting it's a clean it's

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:29,740
open it's a very very transparent

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,840
community so we do have the different

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,679
distributions lots of cooperation with

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,710
the freebsd community freebsd has ported

00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,410
dtrace and ZFS into their core

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,700
distribution

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,960
and we're getting at like I said we're

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:50,010
getting a lot of putbacks from those

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:53,430
those environments so next slide so from

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:56,400
an extent a point of view we wanted to

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:59,640
switch over to the almost community we

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,650
also have oddly enough people confuse

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,410
nexenta core platform with Nick sent a

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,880
store which is our commercial product I

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,790
don't know why they would do that right

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,340
there completely different words and put

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:14,670
together in a different way so we wanted

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:17,520
to take Nick sent a court the next

00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:20,160
centocor platform to the next level to

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,110
what we wanted to do from here we also

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,660
needed a distribution for our engineers

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:28,250
to develop on that's a very similar to

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,810
our end product so the next version

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,150
since I started at an extent oh my whole

00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:36,120
life has been kind of dedicated to this

00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,310
new distribution where to put it how to

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,810
develop it who's going to develop it

00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,390
where it's going to get done all of

00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:45,530
those things have been questions that

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:49,230
I've been trying to get answers to

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,760
including name and men have you has

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,030
anybody in here ever had to try to name

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,780
something it's awful I will I will never

00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:59,160
ever do that again and whatever name you

00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,000
come up with there's always four guys

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,470
that hate it and and whatever whatever

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,800
you come up with there's always three

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:10,830
other day ideas the day you decide so we

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,480
came up with the name of loom ian for

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,760
the illumise Clark colonel plus the

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,860
Debian packaging so right now if you go

00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,740
out to Lumia Norg you can download the

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,900
the very basic minimal server install

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,030
that really is just the illumise kernel

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,020
with the WM packaging we don't have

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:30,210
we're working on actually I got that out

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:34,650
yesterday it was the first thing you're

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:36,570
able to to download it and I'm actually

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,310
since I'm here and they're all in the

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,080
u.s. I'm not sure if the repos are up

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,510
yet so i'm not sure if you app get

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,240
anything if you'll get anything yet

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:47,070
maybe give me a week or so we're working

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,750
on it we have a repo somewhere we

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,360
actually have a couple mirrored sites

00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,250
that have volunteered we just need to

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,220
get the

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,780
you know what we have in the repo

00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:59,240
available to people externally so maybe

00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:02,530
don't do today if you give me a break

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,030
and not there today would be nice and

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,970
one of the things that we've decided to

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:10,660
do was to cooperate with user land with

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:14,270
the openindiana guys so that we could

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,680
you have a pretty similar user line and

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,560
even though our stuff gets packaged up

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,540
in debian but if you know if we find

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,820
bugs in the gnome that we're both

00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,580
building we can you know both put back

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,070
into the same gate so that we can you

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,350
know have more cooperation with the

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,620
different distributions there's also

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:37,730
storm OS storm law says something that

00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:41,780
has kind of had a vision Andrew Stormont

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:43,430
here that says the is the what are you

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:47,450
the king do you get to be the king of

00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:49,670
star molesta they do bizarre and yes

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,850
something like that and he does the

00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:54,050
storm OS and his vision is you know kind

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,000
of the same to have an easy-to-use

00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:58,100
desktop with a good solid solaris

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,220
colonel underneath so storm will

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,900
continue also and then the alumium

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,340
really is the best basis for our

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:10,940
commercial product called the neck

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:13,280
santos or the next so that's really all

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,130
I have I'm hoping that you guys have

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,870
questions and this is kind of this is

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,670
the second time I've given this this

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:24,590
presentation so I'm not really sure what

00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:27,020
people want to know so I was a kind of

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:30,340
hope in that I give you enough to get

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,340
you started on questions yeah

00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:43,970
so the question was have we stressed

00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:46,340
solaris zones in yeah I think they gave

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,200
me a whole hour I did I did I talked in

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:52,970
like less than 10 minutes who was that

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,559
oh good good I started out I hadn't

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,210
really faced the question yet so it was

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,929
about him you had stressed the years

00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:02,389
allows owns earlier on in your slides

00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:05,539
now in alumium do you actually support

00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:09,019
kvm like smart OS does yeah so kayvyun

00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:10,879
got got ported to the to the loo most

00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:13,279
colonel so it's not in the solaris

00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:17,169
colonel at all so kvm is now in the in

00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:22,250
the kernel source tree inside of a Lumos

00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:28,429
and so we built a Lumia out of the more

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:31,429
more current version of illumos so the

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:34,580
i'm ninety percent is sin sure that the

00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:37,669
kvm is there yeah the second question is

00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:41,240
could you explain with a bit more detail

00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:43,549
what the difference is between loom Ian

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,440
and openindiana because you said there

00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:47,149
was some cooperation going on so is it

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,559
just the different packaging or are

00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:56,269
there some more I merrily the different

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:59,690
packaging that's yeah sure we we have

00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:02,240
made fast for for package five which is

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,149
in openindiana so the same packaging

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,799
system like in solaris 11 is in

00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:12,169
openindiana and we have the packages are

00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,850
built built on based on make files and

00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:18,379
the make files are shared between

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:20,149
alumium and openindiana so we just using

00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:22,460
a different method to install the

00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:25,580
packages but the make fathers are just

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,039
equal which is a good thing so we can

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:31,330
work together that's why we are sharing

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,330
okay other questions

00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:41,670
I think one question that is should be

00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:44,190
answered is also am what is the main

00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,950
difference between illumine and the

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,380
former next center core operating system

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,270
where we had new user lands and I think

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,870
it's I'm not pretty mature but i think

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:57,960
it's openindiana uses the solaris to

00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:00,990
jane and also and it's also a day on

00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,790
illumine will not follow as will not

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,640
integrate that much of the canoe to

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,990
lately as used and and that's one of the

00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,870
reasons why we're going to continue to

00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:13,140
support storm OS that that's closer to

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:17,130
that neck centocor that has that more

00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:20,600
tightly wrapped a canoe userland okay

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:27,030
yep i got that right didn't I Andrew

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:31,560
yeah okay do you want answer then yet

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:33,810
the canoe userland is it's it's included

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,870
with opendir openindiana and illumine

00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:40,860
and if you were to like when you log in

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:45,270
its environment sets at the set these

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:47,190
are the default but change easily yeah

00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,680
in like when you if you were to looking

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:54,780
like user bin you would find the Solaris

00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:59,370
clothes or as the new ones are in use a

00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,930
gene ooh yeah we had that it's at son

00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,880
two people were always like where were

00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,650
the new tools and they've been on the

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,270
they've been in solaris for quite some

00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:10,500
time they just weren't in the default

00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,790
path so people couldn't find them so one

00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,380
of the things they did with solaris 11

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,240
was the same thing that's open up the

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,000
path so that you know it's the default

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:22,500
path is is easy to find those utilities

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,690
and tools I have a question there's more

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,700
than one packaging system on running on

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,230
top of Allah most sisters right alumium

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,430
is one and I think joint is working on

00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:33,000
the second one that's completely

00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:34,920
different yeah so the joint one the

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,790
packaging system that they're using is

00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,980
roughly based on some BS d packaging so

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,330
there's this different also right so the

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,010
one thing that we're sharing with all

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,610
the distribution is core is the core

00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,380
kernel and then add

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,710
different packaging utilities on top of

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:54,490
that we have some words on why buy they

00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,960
chose to buy there more than one I said

00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,059
I would love to give you the words but I

00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,980
asked them I'm like well why are you

00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:01,690
guys doing it and they're like cuz we'd

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,549
like to you know I mean there was like

00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,080
there's no there was no strategy there

00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,640
was no design around it it just was

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,390
something that they were used to using

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,940
and they continued using so there's

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,540
there's no there's no reason right it's

00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,669
just like any and I mean there's a

00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,440
usually in corporations you have good

00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:23,049
reasons for doing things and open source

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,490
projects it's like this is the thing I'm

00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:30,130
more familiar with so this is what i'm

00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:32,110
going to use oh you can so we can have

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:37,030
some more we have a lot of people here

00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:41,350
from the illumos community so Joyent

00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:43,030
yeah because we actually asked them to

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,500
the joint guys i had a couple of

00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,179
meetings with them to see if they would

00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,890
you know kind of share with sharing some

00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:50,110
of the work around the w packaging or

00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:53,410
the IPS packaging and it's like why do

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:57,390
you guys need a third packaging and what

00:26:53,410 --> 00:27:01,179
they told me was huh like that I think

00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:03,640
Giants use of Beckett Beckett sorcerer

00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:10,750
predates opensolaris day they were

00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:14,590
starting on yep so nice expression

00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:18,460
developer edition which was using a even

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:20,919
more ancient packaging system so they

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:23,290
chose package source from net bsd

00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,230
because it was already there already

00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:28,660
working and there was no better

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:33,460
alternative and i think i think

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:38,980
continued using it up until now okay

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:43,750
thanks gotta keep asking the questions

00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,919
cuz i got plenty of time you don't want

00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:50,140
me to stand up here and start talking

00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:54,130
about my kids my kids till 11 and he can

00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:58,080
go party in the big chair now yay will

00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:01,590
we support spark so right now there's no

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,499
there's no reason to support spark and

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:09,039
the the probably the core contributors

00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:11,590
to illumos are mostly running on x86 I

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:17,349
know arc it runs on x86 the join stuff

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:22,169
runs on x86 it there has to be a reason

00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:22,169
for it for for people to push it so

00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:29,559
question yeah hi hi um i spend like a

00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,779
year and a half years ago culeros is my

00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,669
development box and i was i was very

00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:35,259
impressed as years ago and i was very

00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:36,960
impressed with it also as a server

00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:40,359
platform and not a lot of stuff that

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,669
either the various linux distros the

00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:46,089
time didn't have or was criminally hard

00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:47,769
to use stuff like so and ZFS and

00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:50,289
something he didn't mention was crossbow

00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:54,789
the oh yeah kraspo stuff is beautiful

00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:56,499
arc yeah um I wonder it was in many ways

00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:58,269
ahead of a lot of the Linux distros at

00:28:56,499 --> 00:28:59,979
the time but given all this stuff that's

00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:04,239
happened now does it lost some of his

00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:05,589
advantage you think and I don't know I

00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:07,749
mean you guys probably could answer that

00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:09,429
cost I'm better than I can I'm not sure

00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:11,919
if the Linux distros have something

00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:13,330
that's like crossbow do they have you

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,940
know do do we have network

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,700
virtualization resource management and

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,619
in Linux and we do have something that's

00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,960
similar to you know you have the BST

00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:24,940
jails which you know have always kind of

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,940
been there you have like the selinux

00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,109
stuff that's similar to zones some of

00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,239
the stuff though that you don't see I

00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:33,460
mean you see system tab coming out but

00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:36,849
it's still not as mature or as robust as

00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:41,649
as what we have you know the the five

00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:44,769
six seven year old solaris and you know

00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:47,049
still is still is quite a quite a ways

00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:49,359
ahead in in what you see in the linux

00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,849
distros as far as file systems are

00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,499
concerned too I you know I watch all the

00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:56,139
new file systems that come out I haven't

00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:59,549
seen anything that looks even remotely

00:29:56,139 --> 00:30:02,950
close to two zs s where you'll see like

00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:05,589
the butter file system the the butter FS

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,849
has the copy-on-write but it doesn't

00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:08,890
have checksums it doesn't have

00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:12,790
compression you know

00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:14,170
you know it doesn't have SAP shots you

00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,430
know and and then you'll have you know

00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,500
something else that will have the

00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:21,280
checksums but I haven't seen another

00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:23,470
file system that has that kind of

00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,230
complete package that's you know just so

00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,780
easy to use so we have the DTrace we

00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,820
have the ZFS and then the one thing I

00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,920
don't even see anybody working on which

00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,440
is probably my favorite part of Solaris

00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:39,520
is the fault manager which has the

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:44,350
ability to offline CPUs now in x86 in

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:46,000
2005 off lining CPUs and keeping the box

00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,370
up and operational wasn't that

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,910
interesting for x86 because most of the

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:54,370
boxes had one cpu at the time maybe two

00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:57,430
now you see boxes with you know I

00:30:54,370 --> 00:31:00,790
actually in my closet upstairs i have an

00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:03,850
eight-way x86 box right I mean it's it's

00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:06,610
very common and and you as you see these

00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:09,670
bigger chassis is coming out the ability

00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:12,220
to offline a cpu and keep the box up is

00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:14,170
very important especially when people

00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,490
are putting you know cloud deployments

00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,680
on that where they're putting hundreds

00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,830
of applications out on that and you have

00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:23,020
a CPU failure and you have the box drop

00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:26,200
that's that's a bad day so the fault

00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:30,490
management is very mature you know we

00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:34,780
can offline CPU memory pci a you know

00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:36,820
Nick's hbas and keep the box up and

00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:39,490
operational and then you can scheduled

00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,620
downtime at some you know point and get

00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:44,860
those components effects but that really

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:47,980
comes from the spark roots that you know

00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,390
the I don't know about you guys but I

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,680
went into sales engineering because I

00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,690
hate getting paged in the middle of the

00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,820
night you know what's tough stuff fails

00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:59,050
so we wanted to be able to offline that

00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:00,370
stuff and it not have the box panic so

00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,870
that's that's one of the things that's

00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,310
still there that's still more mature

00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,910
than you know even seven eight years

00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:09,310
later after slurs tennis as slurs 10

00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,740
launched still probably best the breed

00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:13,920
in the industry right so I guess what

00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:17,800
you're saying is that even even though

00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,330
even if the technological development

00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,040
had stagnated because of the whole you

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,460
know death opensolaris and it's reading

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,140
Kearney

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,480
doesn't matter cuz it was so far ahead

00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,100
of the rest anyway I hate to sound

00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,230
braggy like that I come from the mid

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,870
western part of the United States and we

00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:34,600
don't they don't let us break very but I

00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:37,870
think that we think that we will we will

00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,669
burn somewhere if we brag but if I had

00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,649
to say it I would say yeah I think the

00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:44,500
technology the innovation that was it

00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:45,760
was put into a slower expand it was a

00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,299
half a billion dollars worth of

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,730
engineering that would anticipate a lot

00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:53,890
of innovation a lot of some pretty

00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,169
amazing things now that we have the Alou

00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,850
most kind of up and operational to we

00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:01,000
have all the people that kind of created

00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,679
some of that original innovation now

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,350
thinking about the next generation of

00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:08,289
problems to and and they're doing it in

00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,730
the the wide open and there you know one

00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:11,529
of the things that we didn't have it son

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,049
was that ability to really talk to end

00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:15,580
users and and you know what do you guys

00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:17,440
need you know what should we do next

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,779
what's the next big innovation where

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,200
should we go from here and because the

00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:24,549
community is still pretty small we have

00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,250
you know we have ability to have the

00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:30,370
conversation and as you know see what to

00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:34,270
see what we should build next because we

00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:40,120
love innovation more than more than

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:44,020
anything else more than my kids i love

00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:46,419
the innovation actually have 11 year old

00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:51,039
twin boys they're hard to love at that

00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:53,340
age I think really hard one question was

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,750
a bit with nexenta core because of the

00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:01,809
problems with the namings etc is how is

00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:04,809
next enter as a business related to

00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:06,850
illumine how free was it will it be or

00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:11,109
is it directed I mean is it something

00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:13,330
like Fedora is to Red Hat and how yeah

00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:15,730
so so what we want to do with the Lumia

00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,649
nyan right now is a project off of

00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:20,740
illumos so it's illumos org slash

00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:23,889
project / alumium is how you get to the

00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:26,800
ilume en what we're really hoping for a

00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:29,649
loom ian is for to be a company Eric up

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,740
not accompany a community-owned project

00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:35,110
so it's completely free completely open

00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,630
and you know ready for

00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:39,040
use and criticism and you know all the

00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,620
things that go on in an open source

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,320
community so it's not that the next

00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:47,110
center will make releases as its as they

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,210
did with with nexenta core and I think

00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,680
that was the problem because if someone

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:53,800
from the community wanted to contribute

00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,080
it was very difficult right similar to

00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,810
open solaris i would say at the time

00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,180
yeah yeah so the the process for

00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:04,180
contribute contributing now goes through

00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,580
the the gates and the process for Lumos

00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:09,160
and we're just becoming a sub-project

00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,410
off of illumos we kind of lucky in the

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,620
fact that I mean open in D&O started

00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:17,800
before illumos Scott opened and you know

00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,330
giant started way way before we're kind

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,860
of coming into this later in the game

00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,920
and saying you know we'll just we'll

00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:26,020
make this a project off of a Lumos and

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,020
you know look for community

00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,900
contributions and we're looking really

00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,250
you know their their bosses inside of

00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,050
nexenta that are saying you know we

00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:39,220
really don't want we want this to be

00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:41,470
fully community and you know CeCe how

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,030
much participation will get but we're

00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,040
ready to pick up the ball if if things

00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,690
don't get done but and we have some

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,220
ideas of what we want to do with it you

00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:52,540
know Andrew and I spent most of I don't

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,760
want to say the night the evening last

00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,770
night you know talking about what we

00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,120
want to do with the low man and you know

00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,560
some of the things we want to do with it

00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,420
is get it you know look for some

00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:04,030
interesting desktop to put on it let's

00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,980
look for some some server software

00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:09,040
that's kind of outside of the mainstream

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,990
let's make it interesting let's try to

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,290
see you know where people may want it to

00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:16,330
go and you know this does sound really

00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:18,460
arrogant whatever i want to say but you

00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,350
know I I want it to be what I want it to

00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,080
be I want to be able to run it on my

00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:25,930
laptop and use it for the the things

00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,370
that I do in my daily life so and I want

00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,710
it to be fun and interesting and

00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:32,740
intriguing so where we go from here I

00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:35,380
don't know you know sky's the limit yeah

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,450
so I think it's also what Garrett

00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,000
initiator of the lumo said okay it's

00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:42,220
it's not an extent of thing and that was

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,320
the important the most important message

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,240
that were that he always you had to

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,130
repeat it's not an extent it's an open

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,680
source project so it's the same message

00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,410
you

00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:56,569
you make with yeah so Garrett recently

00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:59,390
left nexenta and so I don't know what

00:36:56,569 --> 00:37:00,800
that means but you know he doesn't have

00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:03,130
to say it's not an extent anymore

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,359
because he's spending full time on Lumos

00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:08,900
and he's in one of those super stealth

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,660
startups you know we're you know we're

00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,280
going to put back into alumium and but

00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,309
we're going to see ourselves we see

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,410
ourselves in the illumos community i'm

00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:21,319
on the kind of corporate strategy team

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:24,470
so strategically we see ourselves as a

00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:27,710
member of loomis having garrett leave

00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:30,349
kind of helps in the fact that we can be

00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,849
seen as a member of illumise now we're

00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:34,790
just a member just like everybody else

00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:38,660
and we plan on continuing to contribute

00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:40,400
to illumos we plan to you know back it

00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,740
up with you know some cash here and

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,390
there if we have to we're going to do

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,130
what's necessary to make sure that it

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:49,609
continues to be a vital community but

00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:52,280
we're like one of the problems with

00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:53,900
having Garrett be an accent employee was

00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,059
the fact that he was the founder of

00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,099
illumos he owns the trademark to Allah

00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:59,869
knows I'm getting illumise and Nick

00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:02,569
Santa confused was very difficult than

00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:04,280
not anymore right we don't have those

00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:07,099
those kinds of problems I shouldn't have

00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,500
to I because I don't own this I have to

00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:14,410
go ask a blast Garrett's permission to

00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:18,109
have the t-shirts printed posted a

00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:21,020
version control system for the software

00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:24,260
of lumin what version control system do

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:28,400
is is used at the moment I think I get

00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:32,540
it I get or whatever not carry the Kuril

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,089
okay all right okay and the other thing

00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:38,089
where are where is that affairs up to

00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:41,690
what what sort of level in terms of how

00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:44,809
it ties up with wherever insularis was

00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:48,650
as it and the changeover to oracle and

00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:54,079
so i think its version 28 if i'm not

00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:56,950
incorrect yeah m and so the oracle

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,869
release of solaris 11 came out with a 31

00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:01,609
one of the things that the ZFS so the

00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:02,040
majority of the ZFS engineers that we're

00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:05,430
working

00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,560
it's son are now working in in Alamos

00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:09,540
and we see that we're going to we may

00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,750
have some compatibility problems they're

00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,700
working on something called dis label

00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,020
versions so they're gonna there's going

00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,880
to be a label on the disk that you can

00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,760
look at so that you can say oh this has

00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,960
come from Oracle the feature flags

00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,280
everybody how it keeps having to

00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,110
remember remind me what that's called

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,490
it's called feature flags right so

00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:29,070
you'll be able to look at the disabled

00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:31,800
and say oh this is this is version 31

00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:34,920
it's come from Oracle it's got it's

00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,560
probably got crypto I may need to just

00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,780
open it read only so we're working about

00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,910
you know being able to look at different

00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,040
so the guys that actually built in that

00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:47,370
kind of backward compatibility for ZFS

00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,540
are now mostly working at Dell fix and

00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,630
they're building out some of these

00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:55,050
utilities to make sure that all ZFS file

00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:57,030
systems can be read by all platforms so

00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:59,940
you don't have to go oh this is a 31 I

00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,740
can't use it when I left auricle i

00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,700
backed up my laptop and I forgot that I

00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:07,320
was running 31 so like a crab could you

00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,640
guys do the feature flags this weekend I

00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:15,030
need the stuff off there oh we we are

00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,340
facing some problems with set of s in

00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:19,110
terms of development because when you

00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:22,350
are a certain version and you want to

00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:24,750
implement new features you you need a

00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:27,510
certain way to go to the new world and

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:29,670
then come back so that's why why we have

00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:33,060
invented to feature flags like let's say

00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:34,860
like like Linda explained and in some

00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,870
some ways we are better than Oracle

00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,600
because because at the moment we have I

00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:42,540
screws your own map which Oracle doesn't

00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,480
have and we also have the ability to

00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:49,410
shut off on scuzzy on map or I can map

00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:53,490
yes and we have the set of s tests week

00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:57,510
was open sourced by Sun in 2008 and then

00:40:53,490 --> 00:41:00,690
left there did not do anything special

00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:04,080
with it and now we got resurrected by

00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:07,640
George and it's build up again as a full

00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:11,390
testing suite for ZFS so we are getting

00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,390
better and better every day

00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:28,190
yes yes yes we used to call it ice at FS

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,680
alumium set offense and then I also know

00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,660
for me at Oracle employee there was no

00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,210
way that I could get you that source

00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:38,390
code right unless you were in OEM and

00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:41,510
and and and you you wrote me a really

00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:43,670
large check to get the get the source

00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,250
code so and you know there's a lot of

00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,950
discussion on our IRC channels in our

00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:51,410
lists around you know what Oracle plans

00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:53,390
to do with the source they're bound by

00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:56,690
the same license we are they should be

00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:58,250
open sourcing solaris 11 actually they

00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:02,540
had i think it was like 60 days after

00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:05,210
the time that the product shipped and we

00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,309
still haven't seen any source so well so

00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,809
we'll see what happens you know because

00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:12,280
the only one that can really sue them is

00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:14,599
them or us and we're you know and

00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,280
there's a there's a joke inside of

00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:18,500
nexenta that oracle is like a big

00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,780
gorilla with a bazooka you just try not

00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:25,150
to piss him off right don't have to get

00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,150
them to point the bazooka your way so

00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:35,510
any more questions questions they seem

00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:38,319
to have more minutes ok well thank you

00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:42,260
for your time we've got a booth over on

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:44,990
the K building on the upper level if you

00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:47,930
want to come over we got free t-shirts

00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:51,740
to give away I wanted to bring yo-yos

00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:53,540
but they made me take t-shirts so if you

00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:56,299
if you want a t-shirt come on over and

00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:59,349
and we can talk about illumise all day

00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:59,349
