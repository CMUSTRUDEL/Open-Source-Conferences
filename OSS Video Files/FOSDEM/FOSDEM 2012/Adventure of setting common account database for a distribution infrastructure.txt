um okay so first I thanks for coming i'm

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,400
here today to talk about the problem we

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,759
either when we set up sanforized

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:22,080
authentication from the major project so

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:24,600
first mmm ah okay yeah so first my

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,939
name is a Makaha i'm one of the member

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:37,890
of system and recession a team of the

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:40,620
project and and so for people who were

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,899
not there one hour ago we are whether

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,690
while using prepaid for everything so

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,730
pipette is an open source tools to cheat

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,110
to take care of the configuration and as

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,390
i said it this is not a word fetish so

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,059
does everybody even know what is the

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,410
major project just a wedgie or n if you

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,420
do okay so photos i don't didn't first

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,740
do your hand i would like to quickly

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,510
explain so this is basically a man with

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,090
a fork when we go was a linux

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,640
distribution while still is my ironic

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,090
distribution which started 10 years ago

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,460
and our last year they will add some

00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,710
financial problems we decided to fork it

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:28,290
so we can keep her the projector running

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:31,650
and everything we did was based on or a

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,920
science as a month ago contributor and

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,259
montival employee and so first when the

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,049
infrastructure of the montreal project

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,930
was created it was using a nice for some

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:46,439
people were old enough this is a system

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,229
used on unix-like a solar winds like FB

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,250
least we have a shared account database

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:59,040
it was good only for the small cluster

00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:01,229
of five computer and it was using it we

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,960
were also offering value services such

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:09,830
as a forearm a bugzilla something for

00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,290
the customer to enter acident

00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:17,810
for people to buy gift and stuff like

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:19,430
that which were obviously using a

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,410
separate account database or someone

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,510
wanting to complain on the forum I to

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,340
open an account then people were

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,100
starting to saying oh you need to open

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,020
the bag that a second icon and then we

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,670
say oh this is the choroid project so

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,830
you have to open an incidence or third

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,480
account and then finally once people are

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,300
IP and want to buy you a CD or something

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,380
like that it's a photo console obviously

00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:46,160
it is a cost value set forward they will

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,900
detail oh right now so the first and the

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,060
obvious one is people forgot the

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,350
password or the time especially if you

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,410
have lots of password you keep

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,290
forgetting or you use the same 1 2 3 6

00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:01,190
and so on that everybody use and it's

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,510
not sexual which is a first problem the

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,970
second problem is people who forget

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,000
their login so obviously in there is a

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,200
separate database of the ways of some

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,450
logins that are not available everywhere

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,160
so as long as you cannot add the same

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:17,930
one it's become a problematic people

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,640
forget out which of the password which

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,850
is also a problem since you have a

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,830
different different way to get it then

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,239
you have to search and first you reset

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,489
the password this is not the good one

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,100
and so on and I finally the most

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,410
operating one is when I mean forget out

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,180
to achieve password for user because

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,519
there is a ten different procedure and

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,650
we are admin and we prefer to do nothing

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,480
than a with documentation of void

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:49,040
documentation then the wizards of forum

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:51,500
and finally on a more pragmatic level

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,720
there is no system wide as here so if

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,940
someone is said okay we're men you need

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,440
to go to 10 different database and hate

00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,360
this person isn't meant this person is

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,370
that mean this person isn't mean and

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,989
this is a video problematic especially

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,640
when someone is living so you need to

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,340
say this person is not admin and so on

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,680
and it led her lots of security or for

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,360
example I no longer contribute to

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,970
montville but I'm still able to do lots

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,609
of nasty stuff since I'm still an admin

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,400
and I know other people who are exist

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:22,410
and why not

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,350
nning to me Anna using the laptop at the

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:31,320
moment and so well we wanted to disturb

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,380
the problem and the first attempt was to

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,990
use a ed IP and a kiss term a database

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:41,610
called am i mod river so some people may

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:44,820
ever heard it and well it was a still

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,280
too complex mainly because it was a true

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,610
accounts instead of one term then but

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,180
that still true accounts it was a

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:57,000
complex because we had to write the

00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,270
software by yourself which was needing a

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,430
lot of manpower because we had to we

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,160
discover everything like doing stuff

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,289
securely doing stuff easy to use when

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,970
people are already stopped the problem

00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:15,650
like 1,000,000 time so this was the

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:19,919
situation just before the fork and then

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:22,080
we did a fog since we were the one

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,180
running away from the infrastructure we

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,210
had to start from scratch which was nice

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,449
I think we did enough to support all the

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:33,289
crap that was done since 10 year and we

00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:36,720
had to start our own Club which is nice

00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:39,210
so at the time we people tend to think

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,919
that we planned everything that we would

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,470
he think about it and it was not the

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,250
case we almost decided one day answer

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:51,330
next day is a fog started to sink fast

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:54,000
and to decide what to do so we can have

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,400
done it a federal-style so Fedora is

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,599
using custom gb and as I am writing

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,940
adapter for that everywhere which is a

00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:04,500
quite interesting because you have a the

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,979
total control of what you store and

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,210
August oh and the problem is a service

00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,889
loads of codes that you have to take

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,680
care by yourself which means that

00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:17,490
instant of discussing on IRC you need to

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,070
write code to debug it and so on so it

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,800
was not really good so we could have

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,690
done a like open suse wanted to do but i

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,419
was at what they said they would do but

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,120
they don't do it and i'll use a open ID

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,950
so for people that do not know open ID

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,960
is too

00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:36,290
kind of stand out to delegate to the

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,930
application which is nice because you

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,880
can use it on an external website

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,950
external website mean usually less to go

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,640
for admin because someone else is doing

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:49,070
the work but the problem is a under

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,810
education and it's not you got that

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,370
everywhere for example you cannot use it

00:06:50,810 --> 00:07:01,520
on facebook on Twitter and stuff like

00:06:52,370 --> 00:07:03,290
that and yet there is a demand and it's

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,380
other than login password because first

00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,600
you have to give a URL so usually people

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,790
normal user do not like to give that and

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,160
you still have to give a login password

00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,040
so instead of forgetting login password

00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,530
people can forget the URL tsurugi enter

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,820
password which is not really worth it

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:26,270
for machine achieve and now finally we

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:30,110
have the unique style as we are doing at

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:33,830
my day job which is basically your LDAP

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:36,410
this entire boss so as I said the nicest

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:40,190
world completely deprecated another

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:44,090
whiff of our youth program kerberos was

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:46,160
not reachable for a system based on the

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,680
web and so on because people have to use

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,010
to set up Kerberos on the computer and

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:56,500
stuff like that and I finally the only

00:07:52,010 --> 00:08:01,160
stings week oops we could use either

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,660
adapt which was a perfect match so

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,820
because the artists is a standout this

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,490
is well known we do not have to train

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,620
people usually I cannot find themself or

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,750
at least be trained by a job or

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,860
something else which is a better for us

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,140
everything that really work can be

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,480
patched up swimming so we code with work

00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,550
out will be shared and I will be taken

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:27,170
care by some other than us which is also

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:29,240
good for us and notice is secure usually

00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:32,270
when done properly of course and this is

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,580
documented because it's a well-known

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,710
standard there is lots of documentation

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:41,210
not a good learner and

00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:45,020
in that and I so finally we decided to

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:47,780
use a adapt so we didn't really add the

00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,780
choice about the server it's a either

00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,150
open idea p or the server from where

00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,730
that and open the GOP was packaged and

00:08:53,150 --> 00:09:00,200
all the way that you want every server

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:02,570
was not it was easy it's a smart set up

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,150
we are we have only a 10 computers we

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,960
have a one master and guru pika in case

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:11,720
of a problem in the master so far we are

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,820
lucky because we didn't have to test if

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,580
it work because maybe the master is

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:20,660
downloading work but thanks God yeah

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,970
question why not multi-master because we

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,700
are lazy and if people want to provide

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:28,340
patch as I can we are publishing the bed

00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,980
configuration for that and also for it

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,470
work so we have more urgent things to do

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:40,610
like doing our conferences and stuff

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:43,990
like that so regarding the world set up

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,490
since we want it to have a secure system

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,850
we want you to be able to say your teeth

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,510
application was the act we need to

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,980
disable it so instead of having a one

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,720
password and distribute it on every

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,510
services we have one password of per

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,090
server and / services so someone get

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,500
access to bugzilla we can disable this

00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:10,390
password without having to change

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,390
everywhere without description and the

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:16,400
one problem we had was to need a 49

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,340
miniature size because it's nice to have

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,860
a database for account but someone had

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,050
to create the account and if possible if

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,930
the user concludes our account without

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,280
asking to us is better for us again we

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,930
want to be able to do something else

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,940
like a quite inside for presentation so

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:38,510
for that the main problem we had that

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:42,890
it's a very specific niche especially

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:44,960
since usually in a company you do not

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,570
need that you are merseyside means that

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,379
can do the job there is no thing like

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,179
people covering the compact

00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:54,029
you create their own comfort and then

00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:55,979
they engage himself so there were

00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:58,589
worries lots of software for doing that

00:10:55,979 --> 00:11:01,349
but mainly from a free software project

00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:03,089
with a identity from cali there is no

00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:04,829
mom goes with the federal account

00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:08,339
database that stuff like that but

00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:11,389
usually it was not designed for being

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:15,479
very visible outside of the project so

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:19,769
it needed a lot of customization so we

00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:21,989
did what we didn't want to do we want a

00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:23,729
web interface in catalyst because the

00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:27,269
seaside mean will propose that was a

00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:30,509
power guy which was not a bad choice at

00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:33,419
least from my point of view because he

00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:35,369
was against our PHP because with PHP is

00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:37,079
the only way to change your password and

00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:39,989
follow and the App Store now is to use

00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:47,429
perl the way the summer after column

00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:50,069
that really do not use PHP and yet the

00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:53,669
main program is a sysadmin are not coder

00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:56,069
so the code is not exactly clean and the

00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:58,259
color are not designer and sis admin are

00:11:56,069 --> 00:12:00,299
not designer either so the code is not

00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:03,749
fully stocked clean and the web

00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:06,959
interface could benefit from a little

00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:09,779
cleaning like a bingo baton from scratch

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,629
so I've started to do that so there is

00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:14,759
the stuff that are not little by 20 and

00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:17,009
the real stuff that I didn't touch where

00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:20,339
are the farm are not all I know stuff

00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:22,589
like that so just to say don't do that

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,350
if you need to create your own project

00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:27,509
and if you really want to do it first

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,279
don't do that and then try to redo

00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:31,559
something the wizard fusion event

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,479
already with lots of project that are

00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:37,470
much better than doing your own stuff

00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:43,289
and really I think it seems easy it is

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:45,239
not it is not because there is a lot of

00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:48,839
stuff too technical for further you tee

00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:51,089
eff I'd people tend to have a non ascii

00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,659
character in their name especially when

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:57,959
you go outside of the USA and england

00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:59,150
there is also well stuff with name some

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,760
people do not

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:04,640
the first name and surname some people

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,920
ever only one name stuff like that so if

00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,360
you try to use the first name last name

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,280
it may not work as there is a lot of a

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,380
lot of problem for various

00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,470
administration about that when you need

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:22,310
to give your first name and there is no

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:25,100
place for putting a space of stuff you

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,980
like forbidden our characters we had the

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,440
problem we want it to be your weather or

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,770
secure so we only use the first titles

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,190
and people complain about not having the

00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:39,860
dash and so on and so on so it's further

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,860
tricky to get it right so we like it not

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:47,360
get it right we still did on and it's

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:50,030
been like a one a URL and the for

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,550
testing we do have at Winston's there is

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:55,670
a one which is a stable and there is one

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,290
which is a trunk where we try to change

00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,390
some stuff and we say to people if you

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,360
need to do something try to use it so

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,580
basically we Freaker or user as a QA

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,490
people and when they complain we say you

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,770
can go back to the stable version and if

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,230
I find the word in verse then I we are

00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:17,390
in favor but so far that's not a problem

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:19,850
and the the main the main interest of my

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,250
conference was the other problem we had

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,640
with the with the implicature

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:32,480
application so we can divide them in a

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:36,050
particular three category so please do

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,260
not love Tomatoes there is a good one as

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,780
a good one is to that fully support you

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,630
mean you insulate it wat there is no

00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:47,420
problem for example there is a

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:50,720
everything on Apache which is basically

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,760
using a dlp without any plugin while

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,190
without a module but this we choose with

00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,910
apache you can use the login password

00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,350
you can west wing by group there is a

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,600
module for jungle which is doing

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,450
everything which will be sinking the

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,920
database from a jungle with a grp and so

00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:10,459
on the with everything about what

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,290
SSgt so that's a good part and I usually

00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:15,410
will you deploy that and you say oh it's

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:21,050
so easy why didn't I do it sooner on to

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:22,700
fly that and then appear as a divided so

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,699
the ballot everything that do not

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,880
support it yet because obviously someone

00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:31,279
has to do the job and usually it's you

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:34,070
so for example it's a mailman mailman

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,980
add some integration but was not so

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,070
great Moon Moon which is a software for

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,550
planet which he has no integration with

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:46,430
the EDR p and otherwise mile square even

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:49,089
if I think mysql since I've been able to

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,769
plug your account database on a grp

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:54,529
which means that you can say or some

00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:57,470
people like I'd say your forum admin can

00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:59,839
directly connect to mysql and a filler

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,459
with the database so far we do not do it

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,050
but if we need to do it it should be

00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:08,089
done like this and there is a so you

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,399
have to to choice either you switch for

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,949
example we do not choose mysql are you

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,019
add support and so far we didn't to do

00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:18,010
that because it's a lot of work and now

00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:20,589
as i say that they can be tricky and

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:26,420
there is a third type of application

00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:30,230
which is the ugly so as I support rdfa

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,510
so you say all right let's try and I it

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,880
doesn't focus you want for example is

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,640
always a mediawiki Omega wiki she got a

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,399
VIP is great there is a plug-in and so

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:44,449
on except you cannot have an endoscope

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,370
in the Logan so that's bad because we

00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:48,620
have some people that are using this and

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:53,360
that they need to create a second

00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:56,990
account which defeat the world idea for

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,029
centralized account for everything and I

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,130
think the way the it's quite tricky to

00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:05,870
fix because it's directly or limitation

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:08,630
of mediawiki there is a stuff like sabha

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:12,679
which we try to use instead of a madman

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:15,020
and surpass that the problem it

00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,329
everything is taught as email so when

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,329
someone the user login it's translated

00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,010
to email

00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,559
and then they made a store in Sabah

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,470
database when someone want to change the

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:29,880
email admin needs to change it by n

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:32,250
which is or a pain the web interface can

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,679
be bypass so you set up and the Apple

00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,289
Taj acacia and people can just decide to

00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,100
not use it which can cause lots of

00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:44,309
program and the integration is complex

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,679
in so there is a four different function

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:49,769
to integrate with the idea p some

00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,289
supporting some type of group and some

00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:54,120
not supporting everything so you need to

00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:57,149
to place the same configuration

00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,240
everywhere I know it's not really going

00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:02,309
on and the problem is then you start

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,570
with look at the source code wait for

00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:08,299
this way and really don't do it it's

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:12,840
it's not something that you should do it

00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:14,340
at all I mean I prefer to do windows

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,779
system administration's and reading

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:28,399
again the sub a source code and there is

00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:32,130
a we add some problem with a PHP v V

00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:35,700
because a PSP do not sync group at all

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,980
so we need a group for forum for forming

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,260
the port for package ours forces admin

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,289
so that the everything can be displayed

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,179
in your profile and you just need to

00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,250
think everything by end which is

00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:51,590
something we do not do so basically

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:53,700
useless and as a whistle bugzilla I

00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:59,130
bugzilla that suffers from the same

00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:02,159
problem from a from a sample everything

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,510
is done by email so you have which is

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,590
problematic because you have to protect

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:09,539
the ljp database so emails are not sent

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,600
in the world which will also have to do

00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,639
it for the bugzilla database we want it

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,889
to for example to provide the world

00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:19,529
database of bug as I download the

00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:22,889
downloadable archive so people who want

00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:24,630
to around fork can do it whether we

00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:26,400
can because I will email everywhere and

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,190
is that some things that we do not

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,610
one to do for privacy with on this and

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:38,520
summer allows the European Union which

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:41,850
reverted to do that and so one tips that

00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,800
could save sometimes two people is that

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,540
everything support multiple back end by

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,150
default I mean it's never written

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,310
anywhere but if you give true at the

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:53,400
observer to something using a open idea

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:57,830
p it will do the right thing by default

00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:02,790
which is not documented but that's nice

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:08,040
and finally are what we are planning to

00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:09,930
do so first we wanted we have decided

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,630
that people tend to forget their login

00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:16,320
as I said so the idea is to be able to

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:18,740
give your email and it will be converted

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,710
to a login and then you will with other

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,150
something or one less thing to remember

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:27,960
the last thing is to get my dog password

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:31,530
but it's tricky so for example someone

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,320
will use as a email to log on the unbox

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,850
Allah or on supper or 20 facts or

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,790
anything and it will build what we

00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:42,060
automatically use any of the email a

00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:46,230
diverse in a DRP which means which is

00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:49,680
much easier in my own opinion we won't

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,570
need to add an open ID provider it was

00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,870
asked by a civil people so they can

00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,970
comment on blog get stuff like that

00:20:53,870 --> 00:21:00,840
which is a easy to do but no one has

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:03,210
done it so if you feel right if Logan

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:07,530
afternoon to do some code we will be

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:11,100
glad to a central patch at work you want

00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:14,160
it 12 a delegation as i said the produce

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,950
from france we do no delegation which is

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,610
bad because the same people are doing a

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:22,600
the waukenah what

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:25,809
no work so the first step would be to be

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,390
able to someone with a taking care of

00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:30,040
the packaging team to say okay this guy

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,950
I want to promote it as a full-time

00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,960
packager to be able to say to do that

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:38,100
without asking to assess I mean to do

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,990
the job which is usually just a weather

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:44,620
when when we are chambers to click each

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:50,110
other as our easy but idea that still at

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:51,940
much for price and we wanted to plug

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:55,210
everything on it so far the wisdom

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,030
services that are not that are not

00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,340
working on it from the operative blog

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:02,919
work price can be used with a div which

00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,770
would address because right now we need

00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,380
to over I forgot my password for the

00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:15,030
blog so i cannot post anything and I'm

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:15,030
not ready we chat my past form so it

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:35,259
we'll take it like this easier um yeah

00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:38,289
the same goes for a planet right now I

00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:40,299
think it's not plugged on ljp so the

00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:43,360
this can be problematic if someone need

00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:49,179
to to change a feed or something like

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:51,549
that and finally what we will need is to

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:54,269
add more information in the schema our

00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:57,639
for example we wanted to have a list of

00:22:54,269 --> 00:23:00,429
where people do live so we can do events

00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:02,289
and stuff like that and for that the

00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:05,109
default schema are not walking so

00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:08,769
everybody create a separate schema which

00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:11,139
is a nice but usually we would have to

00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:12,639
do the same so we have to the

00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:16,509
scheme of someone else or change or some

00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:20,559
stuff we already did ask for a number oh

00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:23,830
no no idea to the yet I think so we

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,600
cannot create one cleanly and all so far

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,359
we still owe you don't do anything but

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,799
it will give us the freedom to store

00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:35,139
what we want in the idea p and I think

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,529
that's all for my presentation I was

00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:41,529
planning to be a maybe a little bit

00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:44,859
slower but i did add so if you have any

00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:46,899
question or even a question authority to

00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:49,570
the doctor will be happy to answer to

00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:56,340
anything and be sure i will not let

00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:56,340
anybody know yeah

00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,300
networking

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:53,670
ok so your chose to write a tour for

00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:57,570
managing that tree yeah you didn't have

00:24:53,670 --> 00:25:00,000
I don't really understand why a diving

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:03,000
season didn't want to use a PHP

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,400
interface like was that you are his own

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
directory in fact it was related to the

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,560
eggs operation I think and uh it was not

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,720
possible to say you need to change your

00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,060
password and to have the PHP interface

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,870
to react to that it just wasn't

00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:20,940
supported I do not have the details the

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:24,330
primary reason was it was also working

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,520
on his tools since a few months because

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,790
we had something operational in three

00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,610
days so it's a rather faster i think he

00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:34,800
was working before on it but i think you

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,020
should i can if you give me you I may I

00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,000
can give you the email of the guy who

00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,070
did that we can explain the problem I

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,180
think it may have been served in that

00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:46,980
because there is no reason but yeah as

00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,650
you can advance for that for some

00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,320
specific reason regarding ljp support

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:55,680
maybe it has been fixed hoodie but I'm

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,170
not that fond of PHP so I was not again

00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,520
so doing it in power yeah because you're

00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:02,160
alone in carmel if I transferred to a

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,010
pitch p interface because a modified

00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:09,120
password just that you'll make a lovely

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:10,950
fire passion yeah let's do example the

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,610
problem is when your password is expired

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:17,730
I'm not a pep expert so pls eid

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:19,770
something wrong just tell me when you

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,480
need to change the password you need to

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,510
send back something to say the password

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,510
to be change its not valid at that was

00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:29,310
the product was not reported or at least

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,980
for some configuration I do not have the

00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:33,570
details for more than why I knew a lot

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,910
of the details yet I can search her

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,910
later okay thanks

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,310
was this related to the password policy

00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:49,170
or no i'm not sure i think we didn't

00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:52,110
have a password policy in the beginning

00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:56,820
then we started to add 1-2 for 12

00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:59,760
weather for a stronger password I'm not

00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,850
sure oh it's in first I think it should

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,860
be enforced on the LDP side because the

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,450
people can directly use idea p from

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,630
command line so there is no need to use

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:12,390
it there is no it's not wise to put it

00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:15,360
under a weber interface and a job i used

00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,370
a lot of PHP and held up integration

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,170
with passwords but i didn't have any

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:22,260
expiring password so that could be

00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:24,870
related well i think you can again you

00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,420
can ask to boken on IRC yeah and i will

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,700
explain if yeah it is a variable because

00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:33,900
which is the main program yeah if he's

00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:36,050
available indeed yeah yeah okay anyone

00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,050
else

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:55,450
hi just a quick question this this peril

00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:59,500
software is it is it not basically an

00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:01,480
ldap editor yes but we wanted who it's

00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,150
not a real dope I did well it's written

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,700
like a depositor what our elder pediatr

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,530
is not something that we want I think

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,799
basically letting people edit every

00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:14,289
field is a good thing for that but I

00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:17,860
think that we should have a novella over

00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:20,200
that that would restrict for examples of

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:23,289
all people add a problem with ssh key

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,020
because i can upload the ssh key but the

00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:28,270
yellow strip the type of the key and

00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,980
then it doesn't work so they say okay i

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,620
cannot connect they asked to assist

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,900
admin so she sent me a check the logs or

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,820
outside the key is not good and so on we

00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,039
lose time because we cannot add much

00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,530
validation on this part so that's what I

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:44,409
wanted to do is add a more user-friendly

00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:46,210
interface I do not know if I have

00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:48,820
internet access i can show you want

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:53,110
interface and yeah that's a DRP editor

00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:56,500
but that's not really what we want now

00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:58,990
that we got we have and is it open

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,700
source yeah it's a published everything

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,270
we do is published from the pipette

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:07,600
configuration to the source code we

00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:10,390
write because if we start to do some

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,960
while there is real negotiation as there

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,460
is no real reason to add anything and if

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,710
we don't publish a thing we cannot

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,590
expect people to discover oh it works

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:24,130
and if they cannot learn they cannot

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:26,919
replace when we want to change when we

00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:28,750
want to grow the team or if we want to

00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:30,659
leave the project we cannot expect

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,150
people to discover by them themselves

00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:36,520
some will but most will not so we have

00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:41,370
to publish so they can take their time

00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,370
and do everything thank you

00:29:48,700 --> 00:30:01,520
a quest a question about a pen ID with

00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:05,690
it is it sink able to provide open ID

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:09,800
service by service maybe win a rapid ID

00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:13,910
consumer yes open ID consumer from maybe

00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:16,910
for the blog it may be more usable for

00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:21,680
the blogs and for other system with

00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:24,230
which are not web related in fact the

00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:28,640
main program i have with open ID is that

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:32,720
if we start to let people using account

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,180
from another database on us we still

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,220
have we still need to say your teeth

00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,490
account but we do not have any

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,800
information need to do something so we

00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:45,410
have to we have the Alcan database on

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,690
your side and the with another account

00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:50,210
database on the other side and we cannot

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,580
guarantee anything about the security of

00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,980
the password and stuff like that so

00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:59,600
imagine if i say your cheese person can

00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:01,880
access to the web interface to assign

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,040
the ether or something like that i

00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,900
cannot check the top as for the strong

00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:10,850
enough and for me it's not it's a no-go

00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:14,000
we can use it for consumer loyalty the

00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:16,640
project like commenting on blog but not

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,800
for something which needs to be part of

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,660
the project I mean we want people who

00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,600
participate in the project whether an

00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:25,340
account on or database and that's the

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,340
main goal for everything that's not a

00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:30,860
problem people want to post a blog or

00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:33,440
stuff like that post a comment on a blog

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:36,410
yeah but not for something that will

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:42,730
presenters I'm not sure if I'm clear yes

00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:46,940
so so enabling up an ID for some website
