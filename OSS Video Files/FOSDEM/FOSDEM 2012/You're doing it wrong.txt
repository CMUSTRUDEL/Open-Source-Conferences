first of all I would like to say that

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,040
the Karissa's talk was quite interesting

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:10,969
to me she touched him some of the topics

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,110
that I'm also going to to touch up on

00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:16,199
but I'm coming from a completely

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,050
different angle from from Clarissa in

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,080
that I'm act an actual nerd if you like

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,019
I'm a geek I've been involved in quite a

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,109
few open source projects very quite

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:31,080
different projects I used to be a gentle

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:35,820
available for quite a few years left

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,980
that back in 2006-2007 ended up starting

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,790
my own linux distribution called xserver

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,149
which is also source-based distribution

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,850
much like gentle and most of the things

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:52,079
I'm going to to talk about today is

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,660
based on my experiences with example not

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,270
the technical details of how you write

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,719
software and stuff like that but how you

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,579
actually grow a community make sure that

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,670
it's the right people joining your

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:11,460
community and how to make efficient use

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:14,280
of communities besides xserver I'm also

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,750
quite involved in doing a big open

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,200
source conference next month and

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,630
Copenhagen Denmark I'm a longtime

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,600
freenode IRC staffer helping with

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,439
setting up new servers are helping

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,140
people with lost passwords and all kinds

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,020
of stuff like that so I have a lot of

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:39,180
experience with communities from from

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:43,560
different angles so and this little

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:48,659
friendly guy here is zebra pick X ervice

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,880
mascot which is also Mendes a bit of a

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,479
community thing because X whereas the

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,240
linux distribution is fairly heavy in

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:02,280
the technical direction in that we

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:06,350
actually spend a ton of time on quality

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,899
assurance testing stuff and so on so

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:12,870
quite often the discussions could get

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,560
very technical and

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,750
perhaps very dry and they could also

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,470
drag out for ages so we need something

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:26,459
fun and light-hearted and super pig is

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:30,900
well not very serious so that fits the

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:33,120
role perfectly for that so the things

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,790
I'm going to talk about is first of all

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,010
what do you mean when I say effective

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,079
community management because effective

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,079
community management is what I'm going

00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:45,359
to talk about I want you to as members

00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,489
of various open source projects to get

00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:50,970
as much from the communities as you can

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:53,370
I want people to join the communities

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,150
get as much from the projects as they

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,310
can and I even want plain users that

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,950
don't contribute to the project to know

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,260
how to approach projects when they have

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,299
problems they have box and so on because

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,129
many of the same techniques can be used

00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:13,709
from all three sides of this equation

00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:15,299
and then I'm going to talk about what

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,230
you're actually getting from the

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:22,560
community I'm going into some numbers

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,109
from from the xserver project how how

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,389
successful have I actually been with

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:31,879
whatever it is I'm doing with the

00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:34,560
xserver community and you have finally

00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:38,129
how can users manipulate open source

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,919
developers I've done this talk before

00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:43,590
about 18 months ago at a conference in

00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:47,010
the US and back then I actually had a

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,989
second title slide called social

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,410
engineering because this is what it is

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,389
about you want to actually make people

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,650
to something useful for you and you want

00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,590
to make sure that you're doing something

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,470
useful for them so so you want to make

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,620
sure that all the social interactions

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:07,440
are going in the right direction so it's

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:12,599
a positive way of social engineering and

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:15,359
in many ways so what you have to do

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:19,340
first of all is you have to figure out

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:22,830
what what do you want from my community

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,770
there's a ton of things you you might

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,610
want from from a community if you talk

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,590
to a lot of

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,389
um source developers they are going to

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,569
tell you that yeah I want to be

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:38,159
community and that's it that's all they

00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:40,800
are going to say which is a bit useless

00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:43,560
because a big community with no

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,900
direction just means a lot of random

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,150
people going on with a lot of random

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,050
questions a lot of random feature

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:54,000
requests going in all kinds of different

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:57,389
directions and you're going to end up

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,039
with a lot of cares if you if you don't

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:04,199
try to control this a bit so you need to

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,349
make you need to think about your goals

00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,659
it's your project and you need a bit of

00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,990
help because which zooms or project

00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:14,789
couldn't use a few more hands but you

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,939
need to figure out with yourself what

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:19,319
kind of help is that I'm looking for you

00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:23,340
might look for translators of

00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,139
documentation you might look be looking

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,710
for people who can help market your

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:32,490
project better you might be looking for

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:35,909
people that can write very technical

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,889
patches for your project and so on so we

00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:40,710
need to figure out exactly what kind of

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:45,060
people is that you're looking for what

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:47,520
do you want them to do and also why you

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,620
want them to do this you need to make

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,050
that very clear to yourself before

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:57,839
thinking about anything else then the

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:01,259
second part of this is that you need to

00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,569
understand what people that are coming

00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,199
to your community and wants to join your

00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:10,169
community what do they want from you

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:12,659
this is very very important possibly

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:15,689
more important than what you want from

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:18,360
them and the reason it's so important is

00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:21,150
that if you don't give them something

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,039
they can use and something that they are

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,020
going to value they are going to

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,509
contribute maybe one patch and then run

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:32,520
away to the next project so they are not

00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:34,699
staying contributors and it turns out in

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,440
many projects it's really really easy

00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,440
giving them something worthwhile

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,520
but the fun thing is figuring out what

00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:47,469
it is they want because many times if

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,110
you ask new people coming to your

00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:52,360
project okay so what would you like to

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,210
get from the project I say hey I just

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,150
want to contribute or I just want to

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:01,800
make it a better project and nobody

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:05,499
actually knows what that means so for

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,520
inexorable example most of the people

00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:13,569
coming to me is young people that just

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,400
started that university so the things i

00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,810
can give them is i can give them some

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:22,020
experience writing code writing

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:24,520
documentation testing software and so on

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,449
experience that they can really use at

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:32,439
the University from a real-world project

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:36,699
with real world demands on them they can

00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:38,949
also write this on their resume when

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:41,289
they are looking for jobs and many

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:43,810
people do get jobs because of the open

00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:47,020
source contributions so I need to make

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,879
sure that these people actually know

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,580
that this is what you're getting from me

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,650
I'm going to help you with your patches

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,689
and stuff i'm going to help review the

00:07:53,650 --> 00:08:04,569
patches i'm going to help push your

00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:07,240
packages that's annoying so so I make

00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:10,120
sure that I I'm very explicit about

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:15,399
telling people that this is what you get

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,259
from me and this actually helps people

00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,199
stay around for the for the project

00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,449
because I make sure that it's fun

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,219
participating in the project I make sure

00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,710
I can't give them any money I don't have

00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:29,319
any money to give so I can't just pay

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,330
people to contribute but I make sure

00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,750
that they're getting some other kind of

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,329
currency that they can use in other

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,550
projects I also make sure that they get

00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:42,760
some recognition because I remember

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:45,430
being a new developer in the open source

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,079
world and what happens when you're

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,300
completing you haven't worked on any

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:51,640
project is that you make a lot of

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,300
patches and nobody listens to you and

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,160
the

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,110
reason they don't listen to you is that

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,970
you don't really have any trust you

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,140
haven't shown all these developers that

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:03,730
you can actually make good patches

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,000
patches that are useful patches that

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,490
don't need 500 corrections before they

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,490
could go into the project and so on so

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:15,370
I'm going to help these new people

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,890
that's coming into my project I'm going

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,200
to help them get a few commits get their

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,390
name out there so they can gain a bit of

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,089
trust from others open source developers

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:28,180
which in turn makes it a lot easier for

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,890
them to contribute the next patches even

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,750
if they go to another project they can

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:34,390
still point it hey look at that git

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:37,810
server there's five patches from me they

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:41,649
were accepted this is worth a lot to

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:43,570
people but new people of people new to

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,760
open source doesn't really know this

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:50,490
because nobody is going to tell them

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:53,079
this and it's not something you read in

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,480
Linux documentation I anything it's

00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,790
something that all all the experience

00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,730
and old open source developers knows by

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:04,660
heart but we are not very good at

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:07,930
telling new people this so please try to

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,760
be good about this make sure people know

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,170
this because a lot of people really want

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,170
to contribute to your projects

00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:25,689
yeah and finally if you can answer the

00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:27,100
questions about what your goals are with

00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:29,350
the community what you want from the

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,439
community and what the community wants

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,740
from your project it should in theory at

00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:38,980
least be fairly easy to come up with

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:46,119
some idea where both parties can can

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:48,459
reach their goals and yeah in exurbs

00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:49,899
case I want help with basically

00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:52,300
everything because it's a fairly small

00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:55,480
project we are not particularly good at

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:59,980
writing documentation for non-technical

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,319
users for example so if somebody asked

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,480
me hey can I help with documentation i

00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:05,889
don't really know x arable i don't

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,290
really know that much about Lee knows

00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:11,470
I'm going to say yes of course you can I

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:14,139
actually do need documentation for for

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,899
beginners and so on and I'm going to

00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:19,449
help you with this so i'm going to set

00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:21,730
out a few directions for this user and

00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:24,009
just let him do what what it is he wants

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,079
to do and then he can come back to me

00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:27,610
and say hey i wrote these five lines or

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,129
whatever and i take a look at them and

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,490
see if they fit into the project and

00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:37,300
help him improve it a bit and this is

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,949
actually exactly what happened when the

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,160
installation guide for x over was

00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:46,290
written a few years back and also our

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,720
FAQ our initial fact what happened was I

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:51,939
wanted some new people somebody outside

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,069
the project to contribute some user

00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:56,110
level documentation because at that

00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:58,839
point we had after his no documentation

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,600
pointer that uses so I wrote a blog post

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,749
about this and said hey I would love

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,319
somebody to help contribute some user

00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:10,329
entered documentation for my project and

00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:12,189
I'm going to help you and the next day

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:15,100
or something I got an email from some

00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:17,649
guy that I'd never heard of saying hey I

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,240
would kind of like to help writing an

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:21,309
installation guide that would be

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,679
interesting but I've never installed

00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:25,509
except oh I don't really know the

00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,749
project and so on and he was very

00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:30,279
insecure in his first email so I wrote

00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:32,350
back saying yeah not

00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:35,110
problem i'm going to help you write the

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:38,620
right knee installation manual and we'll

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,600
we'll figure it out and after a few

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,819
males he actually started writing this

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,670
installation guide he started writing a

00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,319
 and after 20 emails back and fought

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,149
something like that he had an

00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:51,540
installation guide for me and he had a

00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:55,720
fact that I completely disagreed with

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:58,800
and that happens it's all right it's not

00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,410
a problem the point here is not whether

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,540
I agreed with the fact or not it's not

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:08,529
the quality of the installation guide

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:11,230
either the point here is that I had a

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:13,990
new member of my community of the

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:16,839
example community that was very very

00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:19,059
happy to contribute stuff and he was

00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,019
contributing stuff some important stuff

00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:24,459
really and the second point is that

00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,649
before he contributed the installation

00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:28,240
guide and the fact I didn't have an

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:30,519
installation guide I didn't have a fact

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,249
so of course what I did was I quickly

00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,899
pushed his stuff to the website even

00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:37,000
though I disagreed with some of the

00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:39,160
parts and some of the parts wasn't that

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,500
the quality I wondered but he had now

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,939
written this documentation and so I

00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:48,910
wanted his name in the get lock and the

00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:50,769
point is that other new people other

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,870
people coming into the community could

00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:58,600
now start improving on these documents

00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:01,059
so it was a way of giving him something

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,939
back in giving him some respect saying

00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:06,550
hey you're good enough for the project I

00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:08,500
want your name out there you're going to

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,990
be part of this project just like all

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,939
the existing developers but it was also

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:18,579
a way of getting some recently easy work

00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:22,420
to do for our new people which is

00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:26,470
important because new people aren't

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:29,740
going to come into to your project and

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:32,920
you want to have some fairly easy jobs

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,079
for them it might just be fixing typos

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,389
on the website or whatever you want

00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,490
something that some people completely

00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,259
new to open source can actually do in a

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,290
reasonable time frame without having to

00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:46,110
give up so

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,449
I have a lot of small box in nick szabo

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,720
box that really doesn't matter box let

00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:55,019
have been there for six or eight months

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,630
like some typos on the website or

00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,579
whatever I'm not going to fix these

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:03,209
small box that doesn't matter to our

00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:06,420
users and the reason is if I fixed all

00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:09,240
these box partly I would be bored out of

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,579
my skull doing this because it's really

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,529
really boring work if you already have

00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,990
30,000 commits in the open source world

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,000
behind you you don't really want to fix

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,339
titles that doesn't matter you you want

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,300
some technical work that I can challenge

00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:27,480
you a bit and where your resources are

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,220
better spent so keep small box that

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,199
doesn't matter to new people so they

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,930
have something to work on they are going

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,180
to be very very excited about this hey I

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,639
fixed the bargaining table just like the

00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,380
real developers right and I got my name

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,139
on the list among all the other

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,899
developers so it's important to have

00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:49,139
some some easy task for people to do and

00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:52,529
they might spend an eternity doing it as

00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,810
simple typo on the website even though

00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:57,000
it's just cloning the git repository

00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:59,190
fixing the type of weighted editor and

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,959
doing the commit and stuff it's really

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,209
really easy for me but it might take

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,250
this new guy six hours even though I'm

00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:09,589
helping him and feeding the commands to

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:12,240
him and I might even end up actually

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:14,370
telling him exactly what to do exactly

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,470
what to do in his editor and so on so

00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,720
I'm doing all the work I'm still going

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,459
to let him get the credit for us get get

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,389
the commit because it doesn't matter to

00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:26,550
me if I get the Chimaera not it really

00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:30,149
doesn't matter because i have so many

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:32,389
commits so this does this kind of social

00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,889
data in in the open source community

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:37,230
where you start at the bottom then you

00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:39,029
get a few commits so you get a bit more

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,250
respect from model open source

00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:43,199
developers and as you get more and more

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,490
commits work and more projects you get

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,920
more and more respect from other

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,410
developers in the open source well and

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,079
it gets easier and easier getting

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,540
commits into other projects because now

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,730
they sort of know you even if you

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,449
contact a completely new project they

00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,429
can look you

00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:02,279
up and see hey this guy actors did to

00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:04,860
talk it fast them or whatever it is so

00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,569
they like can quickly see that I made a

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,179
lot of contributions so they should

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:11,399
probably trust me so I want to help

00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:14,130
these new people even if i'm doing the

00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:16,500
entire commit basically i want them to

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,169
have have to commit it should be their

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,569
name on the committee because it matters

00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:24,120
a lot to them and it doesn't matter to

00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:28,860
me i mean if you have 10,000 commits or

00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:31,409
10,000 one commits nobody cares so make

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:34,409
sure that that new people get all the

00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:37,260
credit they can even if you think it's

00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:41,029
not exactly deserved because it helps

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,919
them also come up with the next commit

00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:52,350
they get a bit more secure about the way

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:54,840
things work and so on so yeah and you

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,610
need to make it clear what you expect

00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,610
from the community members of course

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:06,019
yeah and at least in the example project

00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:09,779
we decide from the beginning that

00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:11,460
everybody using example linux should

00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:14,820
also be an active contributor or

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:18,330
developer so we don't really make a

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,850
distinction inexorable we do make it

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,610
clear to new people that we do expect

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,320
you to take part in in the project in

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,679
some way it doesn't have to be patches

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,570
it can be all kinds of things it can't

00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,159
just be helping other users with

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,889
problems they already know the solution

00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:41,269
to or something but we do expect people

00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:43,919
to take active part of the project which

00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:45,960
helps remove the the difference that's

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,630
often present between developers and

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,419
users where developers and hey I'm a

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,179
developer I'm so awesome and hey your

00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:59,639
users oh I don't want to talk to you it

00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:02,510
does help remove that barrier and then

00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:05,190
it's it's important because you need to

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,590
decide for yourself how much time do you

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,539
want to spend on the community because

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,950
you can spend all your time on new

00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,700
community members and

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,740
helping them and so on and some some

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,600
people you you will have to spend just

00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,540
for any minutes helping before he's

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,210
going to do some work on his own and

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,620
others you can tell very quickly that

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,360
you're going to spend the next month

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,520
during nothing else but talking to the

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,800
sky just to get him to be a member of

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,310
your project so you need to decide is

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,260
this word it for you and some uses some

00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:42,030
new people showing up in the example

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:44,750
English Channel it's been very obvious

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,130
to me that extra Linux wasn't for them

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,920
because they weren't ready to

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:54,300
participate in the project they all they

00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:57,180
wanted was spoon-feeding they some of

00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,850
them wanted me to read a read aloud man

00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,860
pages for them basically and that's not

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:06,420
what the excel project is about at all

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:08,730
so decide if it's worth your time and if

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,920
it's not find some other project that

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,080
that the user will be happy with so I've

00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,790
sent a lot of uses to bunt Salinas for

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,790
example which is completely different

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,680
from example but which makes those users

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,150
are not happier because they wouldn't be

00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,650
happy with a cable and we probably

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,800
wouldn't be happy having them around

00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:28,290
either because they would be sucking up

00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:38,670
a lot of our time that we feel we can

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:41,010
use better at least and yeah when you

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,750
when you have a clear idea what what do

00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,990
you want from from users and what they

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:48,690
want from you you can definitely find

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:55,020
some way of making these goals meet each

00:20:48,690 --> 00:21:00,030
other and as I said yeah help people

00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:02,040
with criminal bug fixes and stuff make

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,080
sure to credit people it's the only

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,630
currency we really have an open source

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,730
um I know there's a lot of people

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,380
getting paid by IBM and stuff but for

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,290
most of us we don't get paid by

00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,770
companies to work on open source so the

00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:20,850
only real currency we have is credit in

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:22,890
get locks and so on so make sure that

00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,419
people get this credit otherwise they're

00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:27,239
going to run away from your project

00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:31,529
saying that was a waste of time they

00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:35,519
didn't even want to thank me and then

00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:38,850
listen to people's ideas I sometimes

00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,190
have people come to me wanting to do

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,409
some patch or I'm asking them to do some

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,239
paths that I think this is going to be

00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:46,919
in easy Pat's you can do it you don't

00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:49,489
really have any experience with open

00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:53,100
source available but but you can do this

00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:55,200
and then they start working on it and

00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:59,100
they come up with a path where I think

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,149
oh god no not laugh at it's completely

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:05,279
wrong and it's going to completely

00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:08,340
destroy my my project so what I do in

00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,989
those cases is not tell them hey this is

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,820
completely wrong and you're a for

00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:13,859
doing this patch of course not because

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,659
that would be chasing people away so

00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:19,379
what I'm doing instead is taking

00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:21,149
advantage of the fact that I have a lot

00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:23,879
of experience with the project I'm even

00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:25,379
the founder of the project um and they

00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:28,830
are new to the project so what I'm going

00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:30,600
to do is tell them hey that's an

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:34,559
interesting way to solve this problem I

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,239
hadn't thought of that my idea of how it

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,090
could be solved is this and they are

00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:40,559
going to do in my way of course they are

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,629
going to listen to the founder of the

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,169
project and do it that way even though I

00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:48,600
haven't told them their way was wrong so

00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:51,059
so they are going to do it the right way

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,249
after all and they are not going to feel

00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:55,769
like I rejected their patch because I

00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:58,080
really didn't and if they are going to

00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:59,789
insist on the patch unless it's

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,289
something that breaks something really

00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:03,629
important i'm probably going to push it

00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:06,139
anyway and if somebody else clean it up

00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:14,159
because then I have another guy

00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:16,289
participating in my project and then I

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,820
find it fairly important to be open

00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:23,340
about what you do so let's the reason

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,559
I'm doing this talk really is selling

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,179
people thought so so you can get some

00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:31,019
ideas of how how you can manage

00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:32,940
communities but but also so the people

00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:36,299
that are already members of the exhale

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,560
community will know why I do the things

00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:39,600
I do

00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,640
how it helps them how it helps the

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,820
project I've been blogging about this

00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,190
I've been telling users directly in our

00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,320
IC channel that yeah I'm trying to

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,450
manipulate you to do the stuff I want to

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,820
and I'm doing it because of this and

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:57,330
because of that and they are very very

00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:00,060
happy about this approach they are quite

00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:02,640
happy to know how the project is managed

00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:05,430
and many of them are quite interested

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,370
and they might have interesting ideas

00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:11,190
that you can use as well so talk openly

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,500
about it it's open source it's not

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:22,520
supposed to be closed it's not supposed

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:26,340
to be any secrets right and some numbers

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:29,130
x over was announced in May 2008 and by

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,600
that time I had been working on it for I

00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:36,720
guess seven or eight months in private

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:39,300
after leaving gentoo linux the reason it

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,400
was announced at that point wasn't that

00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,760
it was ready for users because it really

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,340
wasn't and even though i was using x

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,010
over myself because I had to so I could

00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:52,380
continue development on I really really

00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:55,380
hated it at that point because at that

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,770
point because I wrote example from

00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,660
scratch completely at that point I was

00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:03,390
basically able to boot into a bath shell

00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,540
and that's it so I could boot into the

00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,190
bath shell and then I could reboot

00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:10,650
basically so it wasn't ready for users

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:14,220
at all but there was some interesting

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,680
ideas inexorable some ideas that might

00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,800
interest other distribution developers

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,990
at that point and what happened was that

00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:25,230
one of my friends that knew about the

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,330
project already he was organizing an

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:29,610
open source conference and asked me hey

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:32,370
do you want to do a talk about it so I

00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:36,030
was quite kind of forced into announcing

00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:38,790
the project at that point which was kind

00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:41,010
of fun because the way i announced it

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:43,410
was just on my private block that I

00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:47,280
don't know 20 people read or something

00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:50,490
like that and as I said it was supposed

00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,330
to be taking as just a few ideas that

00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,340
all at least

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:56,520
ution developers might think about or

00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:59,580
something so what happened was that an

00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,100
hour after announcing it on my blog it

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,810
hit the front page of slashdot and it

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:08,220
hit the front page of the register and

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:11,180
similar big IT news sites which of

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,560
course created a lot of backslash

00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,270
because I wasn't ready for this and

00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,450
nobody in the project at that point was

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:20,430
ready for this our web server did

00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:23,040
survive because it was all static HTML

00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:27,260
basically telling people to off at

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,630
that point which was for their own best

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:33,750
because we were still development was

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,550
going very very fast at that point we

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,190
were changing major features a fake

00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:40,170
shareable basically every day most of

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,540
these changes most of these major

00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:45,690
changes require a complete reinstall a

00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:47,400
fixer bone so imagine getting a lot of

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,430
fuses saying hey I want to use your

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,680
distribution sounds interesting right we

00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:55,110
didn't have time for that so we kindly

00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,000
told people that you need to wait at

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:01,400
least a year before even considering

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,400
that because we no where near left state

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:07,440
but it's fairly stable these days we

00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:11,910
have most of the packages that people

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:14,700
expect we have KDE and gnome and all

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:19,110
that stuff all the desktop stuff we have

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:23,310
lots of server stuff and so on and the

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:25,550
community have been growing to me at

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,320
least at a fairly rapid pace because I

00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:30,240
don't want the community for example to

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,260
grow too quickly because then I can't

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,260
control the direction it's going in I

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,070
like to talk to all the new people

00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,530
personally and make sure that they

00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:43,140
understand the philosophy is and stuff

00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,750
behind example and how to contribute

00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:49,110
patches and what we expect from them and

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:51,600
so on so I haven't advertised takes her

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:55,290
go anywhere really and just let it grow

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,360
slowly but for a long time we got at

00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,330
least five new contributors every month

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,520
and these were staying contributors they

00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,590
kept contributing to the project and

00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,900
very few people have actually left the

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:16,940
prior

00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:16,940
even after even four years later yeah

00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:24,660
and compared to gentle a nurse which is

00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:29,400
probably the project closest to occur Bo

00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:34,980
I think we're doing quite well X gentle

00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:37,260
might have tough but still they do have

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,120
a lot more people in their IRC channel

00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,940
those people doesn't really contribute

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,090
anything to the project they do have

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:48,180
more developers and a ton of these

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:50,850
developers make a patch every two months

00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,860
to avoid their room that's saying that

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:55,890
if you don't do that you get retired so

00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:59,130
to keep the gentle address they do some

00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:03,980
small commit at least that's the way it

00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:06,570
seems to me so it might be more like 125

00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:09,510
actually active developers on the gentle

00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:12,000
project which is still a lot and it's

00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:14,550
not i'm not saying that ginger is doing

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,950
bad or anything like that let you doing

00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,630
quite well just just as well as many

00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,490
other big projects i just think they

00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:25,770
could do a lot better and so could other

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:29,130
projects and they don't seem to gain a

00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,780
lot of new developers either one of the

00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,700
problems one of the big problems of

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,820
ginger is that if you contribute have

00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,710
hats first of all it's going to stagnate

00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,930
on on their box ela installation for

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:44,190
eight months something which is fairly

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:47,430
typical of big projects and when you

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:50,220
finally get your pets committed to their

00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:51,900
packages or whatever they are going to

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,210
mention your name in a change lock that

00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:58,860
nobody reads it's not your name on the

00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:01,050
committee which is important because how

00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,830
are the open source projects going to

00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:06,800
find out your contributions if you're

00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:09,630
not if your name isn't on any commits

00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,120
your name might be mentioned in a few

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,370
chains loves if the one committing the

00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,029
patch actually remembered to mention you

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:23,059
there so people don't get a lot in

00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:26,609
and from contributing to gen 2 which is

00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:29,429
which is mostly because they use an

00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:33,059
antiquated source code management system

00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:35,999
called CVS don't use that because it's

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:38,789
impossible with CVS and systems like

00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:40,499
that to actually get the right name on

00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:43,499
the pathway when you make the commits

00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:45,899
use something more modern where you can

00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:47,909
actually not just get a patch from

00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:51,889
somebody but get an actual commits from

00:30:47,909 --> 00:31:01,769
somebody and just push that commit it's

00:30:51,889 --> 00:31:04,379
so easy these days to do that and the

00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:06,389
third thing I want to cover is if you're

00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:08,159
just a normal user if you don't want to

00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:10,200
contribute or anything you want to be a

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,629
user there is some piece of software

00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:16,080
that you want to use and you experience

00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:19,799
a problem what do you do well most

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,619
people might actually submit a pup

00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,509
report and then everybody ignores the

00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:26,519
bug report right you probably all

00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:30,359
experience that or know of people who

00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:34,109
has experienced it so what you need to

00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,909
do as the user is try to understand the

00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:38,580
people you're talking to the developers

00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:42,570
that you actually want to help you fix

00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:44,369
whatever problem it is it might just be

00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,710
that you're misunderstanding how to use

00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:48,960
the software it might be an actual bark

00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,700
or whatever but you want somebody on the

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,200
other end to help you figure this out

00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:58,769
and fix the bug if needed and so on if

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,779
you actually know what drives the

00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:02,940
developers in the other end you might be

00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:04,889
able to make it interesting to them you

00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,109
might be able to actually make your

00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:11,339
problem interesting to the people in the

00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:14,330
other end and you need to understand

00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:16,499
that open source developers like myself

00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:21,299
most of the time we don't do this for

00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:25,200
money so you can't pay me to fix some

00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:27,539
boring bak that's not going to work I

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,029
have another job paying me to do boring

00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:31,799
work I don't want a second one so so I

00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:32,039
want to work on open source because it

00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,559
is

00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:36,869
me and because it's fun and because I

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,029
learned some stuff from it so make your

00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:41,789
buck interesting to me it's very

00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:44,129
important and there's really no

00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:46,799
difference between open sourced

00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:50,279
available and bike enthusiast or

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,859
whatever spending all that time during

00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:56,009
all the weekends in the garage doing

00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:58,470
stuff on their bikes and whatever they

00:32:56,009 --> 00:33:00,330
have a happy and they are very very

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:03,749
interested in this and if you go to some

00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:06,509
bag enthusiast and say hey could you

00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:07,859
help wash my bike they're going to tell

00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:09,659
you to off because it's not

00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:11,970
interesting to them if you come with

00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:14,279
some technical problem saying oh the

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,859
kids don't work quite quite as well as I

00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:19,019
father I have this problem with the

00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:21,809
brakes or something they're going to

00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:23,519
tell us to start talking about brakes

00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:25,379
and different kinds of breaks for the

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,659
next five hours because it's interesting

00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:29,220
to them and it's the same way with open

00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:31,229
source developers you need to make it

00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,749
interesting to them so they don't ignore

00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:36,779
your buck because they have 5,000 bucks

00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:39,599
open already and they're to do this

00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:45,149
starts with the interesting box that's

00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:47,700
how it works so don't go till open

00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:49,590
source developers something like

00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,869
wireless networking is poor with your

00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:54,509
application first of all it doesn't

00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:56,700
describe the problem at all yeah the

00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:58,289
developer at the other end don't know

00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,599
what you're trying to do anything you

00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:03,269
need a lot more information but it's

00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:05,159
also really really boring who cares if

00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:08,629
somebody I don't know has poor Wi-Fi

00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:12,720
reception I mean not my problem right

00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:15,750
but you could instead to submit a box

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,299
saying hey I love your application it's

00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,490
just what I need and I'm trying to use

00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:22,740
it in this specific configuration at the

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,540
school or whatever but sometimes I've

00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:28,020
experienced this problem that I can't

00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:30,450
really explain where Wi-Fi connectivity

00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,909
suddenly drops and then it comes back a

00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:34,440
bit later or what even am i doing

00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:37,470
something wrong or is it an actual

00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,299
problem now the developer and the other

00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:41,339
end might actually start thinking about

00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:45,659
this because you've described it as a

00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:47,879
bit of a puzzle and we like puzzles

00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:50,669
open source developers love parcels so

00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:53,940
if you can if you can express it as a

00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:56,069
kind of parcel or some some other way

00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,380
make it interesting to me I'm going to

00:34:56,069 --> 00:35:00,720
look at your back no problem i'm going

00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,660
to spend the hours looking at your bug

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,059
and if you manage to make it really

00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,730
interesting to me i might might not only

00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,920
fix the actual bug in the application i

00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,900
might give you some pointers about how

00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,339
to configure the application better so

00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,619
you get even more from it not just

00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:24,270
fixture bug but actually improve your

00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:28,079
users of whatever application it is and

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:30,059
as an example of a really bad bug report

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,390
this is an actual example from years ago

00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:35,400
to the PHP project somebody couldn't

00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,010
actually get PHP running on his web

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,210
server and he thought hey I'm going to

00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:45,000
tell the that it doesn't work

00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:48,089
so he started out very well and it

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,710
actually got worse and then he ended up

00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:51,710
saying things and you sincerely

00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:56,700
that Park actually got attention from

00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,869
the developers but not the attention he

00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:04,589
was looking for right so he actually got

00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:07,559
an answer very very quickly but nobody

00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:10,010
actually helped him and it's an amazing

00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:12,599
Park you can google it if you want to

00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:14,819
there's a lot more to it and it actually

00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,130
it did get a lot worse and he was

00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:19,890
shouting in caps and all kinds of

00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:23,430
there's like five paragraphs that I left

00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:27,750
out or something so it is an amazing

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:29,940
book and he even in saying that hey I'm

00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:32,039
not going to use PHP I'm going to use

00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:36,150
this other products oh yeah so why are

00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:39,000
you telling us this and that's the

00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,440
response he got so I wanted to send you

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,270
a unicorn and a rainbow by way of

00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,099
apology but realized you wouldn't be

00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:47,069
able to sign for it curse your head

00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:49,559
stuck so far up inside your ass see this

00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:52,829
is the typical response you get when you

00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:55,740
submit really really bad but reports and

00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:57,690
you deserve it that's the worst part of

00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,520
it and there's a lot of reports like

00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,140
this and there's a lot of fun

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,880
was like this coming from open source

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:08,970
developers which is beyond belief but

00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,340
they can be just as bad an example of a

00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:15,270
really good kind of bug reporters

00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,860
conclave us a few years back he returned

00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,590
to schedule the development for the

00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:23,160
kernel and he created this new bffs

00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:25,470
scheduler that he thought was really

00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,970
really good so he writes to the Linux

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,150
kernel mailing list describes it in

00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:32,160
great details backs it up with a few

00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,050
benchmarks that he's made on different

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,820
systems and it looks really really nice

00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:40,320
and stuff and it performs a lot better

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:42,270
than the existing schedulers this is

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,120
something that the Linux kernel mailing

00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,410
list is highly interested in so he

00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,460
managed to make this really really

00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:52,350
interesting to them and tons of kernel

00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,270
developers started doing benchmarks and

00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:57,720
started criticizing his design and and

00:37:54,270 --> 00:38:00,630
so on so for the next month or two or

00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,460
however long there was like 50 kernel

00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:06,090
developers at least working on this

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,250
project day and night so that's how you

00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:10,160
want to do it make it interesting to to

00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:16,110
the people that that you're actually

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:20,790
contacting about it yeah make sure your

00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:26,390
goals are clear and have some easy box

00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:26,390
or things to fix for new people yeah

00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,450
that's it there's a huge untapped

00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:37,230
potential in trivial box trivalent box

00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:39,900
leave them alone because they are key to

00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:42,000
getting new contributors to a project of

00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,760
course if it sparks that action matters

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:50,420
to users please fix them but a lot of

00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:54,770
treatment box really don't matter so and

00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,770
make sure you have a few ground rules

00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,250
inexorable we decided from the beginning

00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:03,330
that it needs to be really really really

00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:05,490
easy to contribute to the project so for

00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:07,110
example our website everybody can

00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,630
contribute to our website it's written

00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,280
in markdown it's an acute repository you

00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,480
just make a commit you don't need to

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,350
know HTML and CSS and all

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,320
kinds of stuff like that so we have a

00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:22,450
format that's very close to clear text

00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:27,010
so everybody can can contribute to that

00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:30,130
for example and then have some good

00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:34,359
processes to control this what we do in

00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:37,720
X turbo is that we have on IRC we have a

00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:40,450
patch spot where uq are patches so we

00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:43,540
don't forget patches but also so that we

00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:46,270
can review patches and just as important

00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,400
other random users can review patches as

00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,750
well and they do this it's not just the

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,570
core developers that actually actually

00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:55,480
have gettin push access it's everybody

00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:58,840
reviewing patches this works and to make

00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,160
sure that we only push stuff that really

00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,260
looks like it's supposed to work

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,260
sometimes mistakes happen of course but

00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:11,470
but we base it on rules and not

00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,080
technical means so the rule is queue up

00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:16,540
your your pets in the patch but somebody

00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,260
looks at it reviews it helps you fix the

00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:23,230
patch and so on and for the same reason

00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,930
we banned week is from the beginning

00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:28,180
because you lack the review process in

00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:30,160
vehicles yeah you can review stuff

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:35,550
that's already committed to the VT but

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:39,609
we really want to review it before so

00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:43,590
I'm finding this is a page from from our

00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:46,380
website a lot of people didn't really

00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:51,040
understand what we expected from them

00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:53,260
and what the project expects from from

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,510
new people from users from community

00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,960
members is just as important as

00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:01,030
describing the other way around so I

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,070
simply wrote a page about this saying

00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:05,260
hey this is what we expect from you we

00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:07,630
expect you to take part of the

00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,700
development some way doesn't have to be

00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,380
technical or anything but please take

00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,080
part in the project and there's a few

00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,300
other rules and it turns out that people

00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,240
are really really happy about this and

00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:22,090
it's cleared up a lot of Miss on

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,950
misunderstandings so don't be afraid of

00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:26,599
telling people what you expect from them

00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:39,289
they want to know

00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:52,839
that's it any questions yeah one last

00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:52,839
thing that I forgot to to mention oh yes

00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,869
thank you for the talk just a quick

00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,170
question do you have any problems with

00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:05,270
bike shooting from your community sorry

00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,130
do you have any problems with black

00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,600
shading from your community because

00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,780
everyone can commit and everyone can

00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:16,640
review no no that actually works quite

00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:19,070
well people really want to to contribute

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:24,350
and they want to do commits and stuff

00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:26,450
and we we make it a rule as far as

00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:29,300
possible that when somebody cues of a

00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:32,359
patch it needs to be reviewed quickly

00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:35,180
which is in most cases we try every

00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:37,850
strive for it's gotten worse as the

00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,369
project has grown unfortunately but but

00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:44,300
we do strive to review patches when in

00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:47,530
say a day or so so people get fairly

00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:51,859
quick feedback on on their patches

00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:54,490
unlike most other projects so so that

00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:56,960
works out fairly well in the beginning

00:42:54,490 --> 00:43:00,730
everybody pretty much got feedback on

00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,480
their patches within 12 hours which is

00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:06,619
compared to other projects quite

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,350
impressive but but we as I said we do

00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:12,380
make that a rule because people are

00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:15,290
going to run away again if they don't

00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:18,100
get any feedback from us and it's

00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:21,020
particularly important because a

00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:23,330
question I sometimes get is how do you

00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,150
attract experienced developers to your

00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:29,109
project and the obvious answer is that I

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:33,140
don't I don't try to I don't even try to

00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:34,850
attract experienced developers if some

00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,070
experienced developer come to my project

00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:38,420
on their own and say hey this is an

00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:40,820
interesting project I want to

00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,859
participate that's fine but I could

00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,260
spend two years chasing some experienced

00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:47,720
guy because the reason his experienced

00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:52,070
is that his very busy working on other

00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:55,880
projects already so I'm going after new

00:43:52,070 --> 00:44:00,350
inexperienced people and there's an

00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:03,830
interesting point to that or several if

00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:06,800
you want one is that the inexperienced

00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:07,759
people can take care of all the trivial

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,229
box

00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:12,439
that I don't really want to work on

00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:14,539
myself anyway and the other point is

00:44:12,439 --> 00:44:16,699
that unlike experienced developers they

00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:18,409
don't have a lot of ideas of the

00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:20,719
direction the project is supposed to

00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:22,219
take so I can tell them we are going in

00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,159
this direction you have to follow this

00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:26,329
direction and they actually do that

00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,429
whereas experienced developers is

00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:30,799
probably going to sit tell me I have

00:44:28,429 --> 00:44:32,329
this awesome idea and then goes off in

00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:37,039
some completely random direction that I

00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:39,709
might want to so yeah how indispensable

00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:41,359
are you to the community if you go away

00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:45,199
for like six months will it grind to a

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:49,249
halt or the one sir how important are

00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:51,199
you yourself personally I don't cry can

00:44:49,249 --> 00:44:59,989
you take a holiday from the project and

00:44:51,199 --> 00:45:02,329
what happens then yeah right now I'm not

00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:04,999
very involved in the project because of

00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:06,769
other priorities like organizing this

00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:09,829
conference in Copenhagen for example

00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:12,199
that takes all my time but it turns out

00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:15,529
that the project continues just as well

00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:17,989
without me because I've made I spent

00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:20,209
quite a lot of time making sure that the

00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:22,159
other developers on the project knows

00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:24,489
the direction I want to they know the

00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,289
philosophies of the project and so on

00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:29,149
they are well aware of where I want to

00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:32,689
the project to go they are well aware of

00:45:29,149 --> 00:45:34,489
why we should be looking at completely

00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:38,109
new people why we should help them and

00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:40,459
so on so if I go away from the project

00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:42,079
which could have them i don't know i

00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:44,959
don't want to but but it could have them

00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,619
it's going to continue just as I left it

00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:51,289
I'm quite certain of that and from the

00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:54,439
beginning I've even made it very clear

00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:56,599
to people that it's important that i can

00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:59,569
leave the project because someday i

00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:02,419
probably will leave the project as my

00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:05,779
priorities change so one of the things

00:46:02,419 --> 00:46:07,639
I've been telling people in the project

00:46:05,779 --> 00:46:09,289
from the beginning is that one of the

00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:12,679
wonderful things about a dictatorship

00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:15,199
which six rebel is in some ways me being

00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:18,619
the sole leader of the project is that

00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,710
some to make big changes you only need

00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:23,440
to shoot one guy

00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:25,570
it's very very easy I mean just shoot me

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,020
and I'm gone and somebody else can say

00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:31,000
go and if people want to kick me off the

00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,580
project that's not a problem because I

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,790
can just fog it or something sad another

00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:42,760
interesting project to me it's fine

00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:44,170
really so yeah so do you actually take

00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,820
the decisions and we're approaching is

00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:48,250
going or is this a community-based

00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:51,400
process because as of now I'm thinking

00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:55,000
that you'll take all the decisions and

00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,290
my question is is that right do you

00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,119
really have the right to take the

00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:00,910
decision because you're sharing a code

00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:03,790
as well as a thoughts why should you

00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:08,530
take the decisions I try not to take

00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:11,109
decisions what happens is that I let

00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:13,060
other people's take take decisions

00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:15,910
because from the beginning I made sure

00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:18,820
that all the people closely involved

00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:23,339
with the project also closely share my

00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:26,050
ideas of the project so we don't really

00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:29,320
we all agree on the direction that it

00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:32,619
needs to take sometimes people are a bit

00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:35,710
unsure if I would think something is a

00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:37,780
good idea or not and then they asked me

00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:41,050
but but in general i'm quite happy with

00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:44,770
other people making large decisions for

00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:47,320
the project but wait isn't why there's

00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,970
no community process why don't you make

00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,740
it a big community process with it

00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,810
because i personally think this should

00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:56,770
be more sort of a community process and

00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:59,290
taking that it's like let's say five or

00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:02,109
six people take a decision do you want

00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:04,780
to reduce the bike sheds some somewhere

00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:07,599
else or what is the initial what is the

00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:11,500
it it is a community process in many

00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:13,630
ways because I don't really I don't

00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,820
really see that much difference between

00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:18,190
users and developers they are all

00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:20,260
participating in the project and

00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:23,380
everybody can have good ideas so if

00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,300
somebody that's not really a developer

00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:27,220
anything has a great idea that we should

00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,440
switch to another web server whatever

00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:31,470
i'm going to listen to it just as if it

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,299
was somebody else doesn't matter to me

00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:37,420
so community members can make

00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:40,890
big changes and sometimes they do not a

00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,890
