so hello everyone I'm Philip it's been a

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,010
couple of years but I've been roped into

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,040
giving the opening talk again this is

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,580
the 12th edition of Muslim and this year

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,230
we actually have a second building we're

00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,350
TLS pretending to be me and giving this

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,630
exact same presentation but without a

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,180
couple of subsections so I'd like to

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,670
welcome you all to post them but before

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm allowed to welcome you I should say

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,470
something about this building we're in

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,180
it doesn't belong to us we just borrow

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,460
it for the weekends it actually belongs

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,680
to the University leave her that we sell

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,440
which is one of the many universities in

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,059
Brussels and this gentleman owns it and

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,500
he would like to talk to you for a

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,500
couple of minutes and tell you about it

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,090
very much ladies and gentlemen dear

00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,640
participants I'm really pleased to work

00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:04,159
on you all for this used event at the

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,830
envious deliverable said free university

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,580
of brussels we all are really

00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,770
enthusiastic about this conference this

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,650
event will gather more than 5,000

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:19,690
developers discussing and working

00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:22,159
together on free open source software

00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:26,600
showing us the power of open source

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:32,000
projects I remember when this event we

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:35,899
was a much more one called awesome at

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,830
the beginning of the 21st century at

00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:42,710
that time many of our professors didn't

00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:46,160
understand the importance of that

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:50,330
initiative I remember one colleague of

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:53,659
mine I will not reveal his name calling

00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:59,179
this gathering I quote him programming

00:01:53,659 --> 00:02:01,610
under Maha wanna form all the open

00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:04,069
source of defenders will then find

00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:08,179
themselves one day confronted with this

00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:11,030
kind of content or just looking at the

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:13,520
list of key speakers of this conference

00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,950
clearly demonstrates the seriousness and

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,760
usefulness of open-source software and

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,640
technologies all the major firms in the

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,239
ID sectors are now developing

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,069
open-source departments free open-source

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,370
software allows technological

00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:35,900
development that can be matched with by

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:38,870
the paid themes of huge firms Android

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,760
and it's linux kernel is a common

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,569
example but there are thousands of

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,599
others from the Firefox web browsers to

00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:51,800
more complex specialized programs

00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:54,440
nowadays everybody uses at least a part

00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,450
of software which was once develop

00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:02,210
freely and published entirely maybe it

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,060
means that we are all maha wanna smokers

00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:08,750
now

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:12,200
from the CEO of IBM to the university

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,180
teachers more specifically open source

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,409
software and technologies are necessary

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:21,890
to develop universities research and

00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:24,260
education however the university

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,560
sometimes tend to underestimate this

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,930
crucial need the tag that this

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,980
conference is taking taking place on

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:38,540
this campus in this university is for us

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,129
of great symbolic importance we must

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,760
fight against the ascendancy that

00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:46,579
dominates the academic world to patent

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,849
every single piece of all of code it

00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:53,510
undermines badly the developments of

00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:56,540
science and it's a great fret not only

00:03:53,510 --> 00:04:00,349
for universities but also for the entire

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:03,879
society we must resist to the mermaids

00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:07,280
song of software editors when they swear

00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:11,829
that they'll never make us pay for what

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,510
we developed it is never true today

00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:17,599
every university in the world is paying

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:21,079
for programs and routines that were once

00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:24,229
really developed inside our labs in

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,860
other words universities are using

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:31,760
public funds to pay private firms owning

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:35,389
publicly funded patterns in these times

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:39,289
of economic economical crisis implying

00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:44,270
huge cuts in public expenditures it

00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:47,240
seems such no sense to me so thank you

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,120
all of you thank you for joining this

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,659
great and free event despite the

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,120
freezing cold and the snow demonstrating

00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:59,419
with open source free software's and

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,820
technologies a crucial and need to be

00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:05,810
developed and protected from the greed

00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,789
of some short minded persons your work

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,180
during this weekend will have the

00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:14,300
university's all other the world to

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,830
develop new research projects without

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,080
you we could not work

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,720
efficiently all the University

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,730
researchers all the University students

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:29,790
oh you are a special thing also for the

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:33,090
organizers of its conference for doing

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:36,450
such an amazing work Philly and with an

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,940
incredible enthusiasm and last but not

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:42,090
least thank you for your can intention

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:46,880
you during this exclaiming extremely

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,880
long speech every nice forum thank you

00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,020
thank you for the kind words i also

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,440
remember about ten years ago the same

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,880
person our interactions with our kind

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,820
hosts have improved a lot over the years

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:15,750
and i hope we can add another 12 years

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:21,690
to our existence here thank you so force

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:25,440
them yes this year we seem to have gone

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,790
and exaggerated some more we have two

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,960
hundred and seventy three hours of

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,360
scheduled contents in a weekend which is

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,800
just a little bit insane since there's

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,030
only one hundred and fifty six hours in

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,070
a week so if you're trying to see

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,680
everything I'm afraid you will just have

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,170
to give up because it's not going to

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,670
happen we do have a very nice video team

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,930
which is video in many or most of the

00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,960
presentations so you can go home and

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,120
watch the other two hundred and seventy

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,390
hours which you won't be able to see

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,670
during the weekends this year in

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:05,700
particular we have I think we used to

00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:09,480
say we have 250 talks it turns out that

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:12,060
that's more like 420 talks so you'll

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:16,520
adjust the t-shirts there's markers at

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:19,260
the info desk if you want to change them

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,050
yeah we have four keynotes this year

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:29,259
they are all in this room as usual

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:30,879
and yeah we have today we have right

00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:35,860
after me Robert door who is going to

00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:37,870
speak about a decor and how the free

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,270
software model is very good for his

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,810
business how he feels that every company

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,610
should be doing the same later on this

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,560
afternoon we have Simon tips coming to

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,440
talk about the new evolutions in the

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,060
open source movement in particular how

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,900
they are reforming their organization I

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:58,090
think this is very exciting

00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:00,159
announcements two moro no not tomorrow

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,110
you have an extra key to it is here we

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,650
have large titanius talking about

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,569
distributions and how we should rethink

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:11,229
you have a bit because the current model

00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:13,330
is quite old and then tomorrow afternoon

00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:15,580
bedale garvey is going to talk about

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,159
freedom out of the box which is a

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,099
presentation which lies in neatly with

00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:25,690
last year's opening talk given by eben

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:29,680
Mogollon about the freedom box we have

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,330
some main tracks they are in this

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,979
building the j building and they're also

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,250
in the k building which i will talk

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,950
about at length in a little bit today in

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,390
here we have the keynotes until i think

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,279
one or so in the afternoon or possibly

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,709
two and then there's the hypervisor

00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:46,329
struck which is very exciting in your

00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,010
booklets you'll find who is speaking in

00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:50,200
it and then in the k building there's

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,850
the future of you i track today there's

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,430
a nice big room not quite as big as this

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,200
one but almost as big so i think you

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,149
should definitely go over there and

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,709
listen to the future of you I if that's

00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:04,600
your thing tomorrow in here we have the

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,209
system track in the development track

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,190
again the talks in there are in your

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:12,100
booklets I can't possibly remember all

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,570
the talks we have at this conference the

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,130
network and IO track are in the K

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,740
building and there's a community track

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,990
there too so the cabling you should

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,519
definitely try to get there we have

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,500
developer rooms developer rooms have

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,029
traditionally been I think both of them

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,810
started with them and now every other

00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:30,399
conference is picking them up we still

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,440
well we don't own them but we feel

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,149
everyone should do them they are spread

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,019
all over the campus of its so you'll

00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:40,339
need to use your skis

00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:42,319
find your way around the J building is

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:46,189
where we are now the h building is a

00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:49,160
very long dark corridor over there aw is

00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:51,739
across the sky pests the the slope on

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,709
the other side of the roads the k

00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:57,079
building is a little way out of the way

00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,879
and the U building is as usually you go

00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:00,829
under the building and then into the

00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,649
building and you just follow all the all

00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:08,869
the signs pointing at things which are

00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:11,989
clearly false Demi that's today tomorrow

00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:14,059
we change devrim Zab its but they stay

00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:16,160
in the same buildings so as long as you

00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:17,629
you know find your way around these

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,910
buildings you should be you should be

00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:25,189
happy again despite the fact that we

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,629
have two rooms giving the keynote this

00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:28,339
one is quite full the other one's

00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:30,110
probably also quite full to the chance

00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,329
that developer rooms are not going to be

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,369
full is practically zero so if you see

00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:36,739
this sign on the door please don't enter

00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:38,629
because otherwise our good relationship

00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:40,129
with ulb is going to go downhill very

00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:42,379
quickly if we set their buildings on

00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:45,860
fire so let's not do that if the room is

00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:47,660
full don't go in follow the stream or

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,379
ask your friends inside to tell you what

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,850
the talk was about and well try to show

00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:56,600
up early if there's a talk which really

00:10:52,850 --> 00:11:00,139
interests you if something bad does

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,179
happen we do have a Red Cross presence

00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:04,309
here they are upstairs in the cloakroom

00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:07,339
we not put them there it's the best

00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:09,649
place to put them if you need some help

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,240
we have lots of people running around in

00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:14,119
yellow t-shirts and in orange t-shirts

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,499
they come well if you need carrying they

00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:18,470
can probably carry you but if possible

00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:21,189
try not to hurt yourself too much but if

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:24,799
there's a problem we could probably help

00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:26,179
so I'm not sure if anyone passed the

00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,619
info desk lots of people tell me they

00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,089
haven't found the info desk it's over

00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:31,519
there somewhere and we have nice

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,759
booklets and someone promises to give me

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,169
one but I haven't got one it's tells you

00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,269
everything you need to know about host

00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:39,649
them it's portable you can carry it

00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:41,779
around with you much like a laptop but

00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,269
it consumes no power so it's unlikely to

00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:46,579
run out of battery if you need to know

00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:49,340
where something is happening there's a

00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:54,410
nice map on the back the map also has

00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:56,300
some possibly corrects venues for where

00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:03,320
you might get other lunch than what we

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:05,780
provide here at the events we have fast

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,940
foods and only fast food I'm afraid it's

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,010
all out in the parking lot over there

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:15,250
you might have to look a bit under the

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:17,540
snow but there are Belgian fits we have

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,900
pizza I think we have even got a

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,820
vegetarian option for those who like it

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:26,900
if you get hungry that's where you need

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:29,270
to be oh we also have caffeine feel this

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,920
is important to point out maybe more for

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:34,970
the benefit of the organizers then for

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:37,520
the visitors in addition to last year we

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:40,280
have two bars we have a second bar in

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,990
the building just north of the h

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,420
building I'll pointed out on a map in a

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,430
bit which is very comfy bar and someone

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,960
has bought a real coffee machine so you

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,080
can get coffee instead of this brown

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,250
water which some people call coffee as I

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,770
said it's more comfortable than the

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,620
other one up there and there's also more

00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:00,290
space so that one looks full just plow

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:04,870
through the snow and there's coffee at

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:08,750
the other ends as a rewards so that's a

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:10,580
my pointer I've actually here is the

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,100
place so I mentioned we have a new

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,540
building this year I should point out

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,510
there's a number of ways to get there

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,820
you are here the other building is there

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:22,070
you might find it tempting to go this

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:25,280
way through the car park if you do this

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:27,830
you will fall and break something so

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,450
don't do that so go out the front either

00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,040
go outside the building or go through

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,570
the h building and then you can go

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,330
through the bar here stop for some

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,560
coffee on the way halfway and then

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,940
wander across to decay building and the

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,280
entrance there's two entrances there's

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,620
one upstairs where the arrow is not and

00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,870
then there's one downstairs where the

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,220
arrow is if you like a long walk you can

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,640
walk to the end of the building and then

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,980
walk around there it's their signs there

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:56,470
are signs but I suggest you stop halfway

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:59,809
for a coffee good for you

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:03,199
this building is all new we haven't had

00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:05,660
it before so we put a new info desk

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,249
there they don't have t-shirts the

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,720
t-shirts are all at the age bill they

00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:11,269
give us and where they usually are but

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,949
we do have stands up there we have two

00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:15,189
sets of stands we have the sons of the

00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:18,319
ground floor of the building which is

00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:23,089
just beyond the info desk on the back

00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:24,860
and then on the second floor or well the

00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:27,410
first floor which is labeled the second

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,110
floor there are more stands behind the

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,879
auditorium and there's also a couple

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,100
more entrances so if that room is really

00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,689
full try to use all the exits rather

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,100
than clogging the really tiny one

00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:41,329
downstairs only there's also a second

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,420
and a third floor which are labeled

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:46,279
third and fourth floor this map is

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,369
actually 90 degrees rotated with respect

00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:51,920
to reality walk upstairs you will wonder

00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:54,049
on the right and then on the left are

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,600
three rooms and those are the developer

00:14:54,049 --> 00:15:00,049
rooms marked k dot three mumble mumble

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,230
and gate off for mumble mumble but the

00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:04,759
building only has four floors so you

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:09,290
can't go higher than three which is

00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:11,149
labeled for important things I see a

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,220
bunch of laptops but you're probably

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:15,949
well you probably find out already we

00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,379
have network availability of course it

00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:20,149
has ipv6 for those who are still not

00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:22,610
well might be v6 we also have legacy

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:25,069
connectivity you will be has kindly

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,889

pockets and then code lectures

00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:05,179
Microsoft's open source repository they

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,150
also hosts open source software a bit

00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:10,610
like github but different HP has

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,260
hardware they've given us money they

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,640
were planning to give us gadgets but

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,010
that didn't work out this year

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,549
unfortunately but thank you to all our

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,870
surprised but he turned up in our

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:37,120
account from France we were looking for

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,370

remembering we sense of emails and it

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,700
turns that Mozilla has kindly given us

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,890
very nice program of grounds and we hope
