	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
a common criteria simplification and

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:08,389
especially how it relates to open source

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:12,059
projects so this is the short again at

00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:15,420
first light coma criteria what it is and

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,699
why you use it and then how it the

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,520
relation of the source of the worst

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,340
together with open sores and how can an

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,570
open source project be computed common

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,670
criteria certified and how the

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,650
specification effective project and you

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:37,860
can interrupt with questions at any time

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:40,950
just feel free so first how many of you

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,010
think you have a some handsome what

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,110
comic right here is all about everyone

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:52,320
wore mostly fantastic let's see if it's

00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:55,079
really like that so what is common

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,120
criteria well it's short for comic a key

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,090
area for information or technology

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,940
security evaluation I need to stand up

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:07,350
for a computer software certification

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:10,470
defined by ISIL of us and what does it

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,450
provide it provides assurance that their

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,330
specification implementation and

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,700
evaluation processes of certified

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,640
products or down according to a rigorous

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,190
standard way and there are certain ways

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,950
why you want to have this which we will

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:31,590
come back to later so who uses como

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,430
criteria and live well there are three

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:38,370
kind of user categories which are

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,850
interested by common criteria and one is

00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:44,280
the force forgive the system come to

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,500
consumers the actual customer sold

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,870
product and they want to specify their

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,090
functional and security requirements and

00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,160
torrance requirements then there are the

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,980
vendors force you can advertise that

00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,610
their products are certified to get into

00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,950
some deals etc and sell better and then

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,730
finally there are testing laboratory to

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,110
make a Pepsi also he comes by actually

00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,700
testing and evaluating different

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:17,040
products those are the channel three

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:19,050
categories that are infestation so why

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,520
on earth or you want to go through a

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:25,050
coma criteria certifications well the

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,360
basically the only reason why you want

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,850
to do it as a developer or vendor is

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,010
that the user groups like banks

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,130
governments and mega corporation

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,560
sometimes required certified software in

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,709
order for you to install them either

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,080
order for them to use it and of course

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,030
of the source values like ourselves have

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,790
the same requirements as proprietor

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:51,989
members so either you're in round if you

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:55,140
want to make business work if someone

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,200
wants to use your software it's a very

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:02,220
binary

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,620
the one thing that this kind of put for

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,410
McGarry immediately such as comcast is

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,930
very static certification we get back to

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,990
that they're more labor so you have one

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,370
certified version and that means that no

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,370
other versions are certified

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:25,910
so no we have established that yes if

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:28,280
you have some users to actually require

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:31,879
from a quick certification then us a

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,690
developer you want to do it so how does

00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:38,500
it work and what do you do so there are

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,500
four

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,630
four different actors in a computer

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,180
certification one is the sponsor who

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,150
actually pays for it one is the

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,970
developer we plan software and the third

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,650
is the lad who does the evaluation and

00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:01,020
the final one is sissification body too

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,390
much actual issues the script that means

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:06,840
they sign that my state bird SS that is

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,700
software community are certified so

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,970
those are the four actors in a

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,970
certification

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:22,030
and what does sissification do well it

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:29,480
tests as a few things primarily it has

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:32,990
documentation 611 error exactly

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,090
and the community area evaluation tests

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,480
that the documentation of security

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,270
functions is complete that you don't you

00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,390
know leave some stuff out or make a fast

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,970
global augmenting your face and secondly

00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:49,190
also test the implementation that the

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,880
security functions actually do what you

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:56,660
claim that they do which is probably you

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,970
know the most interesting name and they

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,040
also test things about the development

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,600
environment and development process so

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,470
the test of the development environment

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,300
is fairly secured and that you had

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,480
somewhat secure development processes so

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,580
it's not to reveal for someone to break

00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,629
into your system of plans and

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:21,229
and now we're into software even future

00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:24,409
versions because nobody step so that's

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:29,300
the basic thing study for marketeers

00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:32,810
application tests and now in your hands

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:38,719
and we will say that from criteria this

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:42,289
is Mike's worse it's a just a very large

00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:43,699
amount of free level at minute so this

00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:46,039
is the first thing when you do a

00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:49,310
computer application you have to figure

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:52,250
out what the hell muscle is me and you

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,409
know there are all these three-letter

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,620
acronyms and they reference to each

00:05:54,409 --> 00:06:01,030
other and it's just very hard to

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,500
remember what the hell is TS f or m

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,270
attacker and when you go through the

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,840
evaluation you get a message from the

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:13,400
lab that says well you pay to talk most

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:17,400
alrc on the for FM see one in the after

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:20,130
speak it is a multi-campus to me

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,050
have to google they won't staff is PR

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:27,500
the first time do you know the meaning

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:32,190
of all these which are written almost

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:34,650
like TS a pet i yes is target secured a

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,520
function no no security function

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,830
interface exactly it's kind of recursive

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,250
afternoons as well because toe is

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,710
another acronym so this is a toad

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,840
security control interface so these

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:54,660
acronyms in acronyms part of the

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:56,580
Malaysian security so if the first thing

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,350
is takes a when you sort with a

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,060
certification it takes some time for

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,630
actually to get to learn all the cool

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,639
the terms at least 2 11 where you can do

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,139
something about it so that's like the

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,349
first six months of the evaluation

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:13,280
period not use terms like and also like

00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:13,280
to see

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,230
yep

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,800
exactly but if you learn what the csfi

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,830
means you actually really it doesn't say

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,940
much yourself understand what consumers

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,940
and how it links together

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,950
that's the valuation assurance level

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:44,530
so we'll go through this a little bit

00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:46,630
more to get your head around it so when

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:50,290
you start with a comic ratification you

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,360
have a few documents to start with the

00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,220
first one is of course or the compared

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,290
to a standard they are actually free

00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,710
downloadable unless any other ISO

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:05,100
standards but that's you know like 45

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:08,110
toughness 200 pages each so that defines

00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,910
will redefine the requirement because

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,670
there are a lot of predefined Aquinas

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,620
and which you can you can choose from so

00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,980
i would say that primary target at the

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,240
evaluators the evaluation lab is the

00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,540
only one who actually can read and

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,370
understand that it's time ago class

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:27,250
secondly we have a protection profile if

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,070
you're not here is which we were and

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,840
that is predefined requirements for

00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,090
certain type of software bricks off the

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,120
firewall smart parts certification

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:39,370
authorities and those are documents that

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,590
are created by user groups or

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,300
governments for example missed the party

00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,390
mode affairs

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,160
you crazies predefined security

00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,500
requirements which says that a

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,959
certification authority must be able to

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,170
issue certificates and must be able to

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,050
manage reputation information and the

00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:02,100
same with smart RCM it has to create d2c

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:05,220
interceptor so we love data so lonely

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,670
this disordered certification process

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,970
and then you can't you have too small to

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:15,649
create a lot more things and so this is

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:18,570
what we have to create as the developer

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:21,810
well as you see this is only page 1 of

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,600
the listicle where you have afraid first

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,370
you have to create the security target

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,050
the security target describes all the

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,870
security functions that you're so

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,060
perhaps and the stress that these

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,310
security functions or manage the counter

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,440
I mean there's no point in having a

00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,940
security function if it's classic

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,959
correspond to some threat that you want

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,850
to counter so luckily if you have a

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,430
protection profile this is actually

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:51,390
mostly a complete protection profile so

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:53,040
this one you're lucky then it comes to

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,220
stuff that you have to create from

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,510
scratch first we have a functional

00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:03,089
specification which describes all the a

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:06,720
security functions in detail we show you

00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:10,350
examples of it secondly we have a design

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,020
specification which describes modules

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:17,579
and interactions between different

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:19,920
motives and software and then we also

00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:22,620
have implementation representation can

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,540
we also lucky because a cig limitation

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,110
representation is basically a list of

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,089
all the parts in your support and they

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,339
are kind of like you use to like

00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:41,160
suggestion of the generations

00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:42,779
that's releases on the world page 2 in

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,589
the long list of documents that you have

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:49,230
to create some people they crab crab

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,949
crab parative procedures that's how to

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:58,350
configure the system in order to be

00:10:51,949 --> 00:11:00,660
certified installation yeah that we have

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:04,439
operation use the guidance of the user

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,050
system and we have a test plan which J

00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:09,240
where you have to open up the test and

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,370
actually test protocols for all the

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,519
security functions in your system so you

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,209
can prove that you are tested everything

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:21,569
we have to secure the architecture that

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:26,059
defines how your software implement

00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:29,129
security in a kind of architecture way

00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:33,089
something called lifecycle support which

00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:35,850
is probably the document that affects

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:39,209
your open source project the most so

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,949
we'll put a lot about this that defines

00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:44,600
their processes for development and

00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:48,149
release and how you for example except

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,160
floors issue reports from users if you

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:53,610
surprise a security problem how you

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,889
receive it and that and also

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,749
configuration lists lists of all files

00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:02,749
and external dependencies if you use

00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:02,749
other libraries like Apache libraries

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:09,340
so that was only two pages of different

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,540
documents that we have to create you the

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,540
information theory

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,540
so I'm show you a little bit more in

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,730
detail about what these documents are

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:29,250
and describe some of these three other

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:32,640
acronyms first then testicles target as

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:37,560
we mentioned the security target defines

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:41,780
the TV which is the target evaluation

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,910
your software and it describes the tsf

00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:47,570
which is the t OE security functions

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,640
well the security functions of your

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,590
software implement one of the most

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:57,150
important things that this secured

00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:59,820
target device is actually the boundaries

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,620
of your target of evaluation it defines

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,380
what is inside and what is outside of

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,050
the evaluation that means what the lab

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,960
will actually look at so this is in our

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,080
case in the CC cool project will turn

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,240
that the actual software java file if we

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,270
develop and the configuration of those

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,460
that that is what is inside the target

00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,280
of evaluation what is actually evaluated

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,950
then outside we leave like hardware

00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,110
security module database and application

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,290
see you

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:32,390
yeah that is out of the scope of the

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,040
evaluation that means that allowed we

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,079
notes they produce my scale the

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,589
phosphorus it means that the lab will

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,570
not bother about the secured pay for

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:44,000
most with not about the security of my

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,910
schedule posted itself so they do not

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,390
look into the security people of the

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,240
database so it can be how insecure if

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,399
you want basically what do you have to

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,149
take care of exactly their connections

00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:01,610
to this so then the lab focuses on this

00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:03,649
great point that's very important to

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,860
define what is inside outside of the

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,860
scope

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:13,240
that require negotiation or your they

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,520
don't said that you we would like to

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,520
have a whole package well

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,810
then it requires little bit on

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,420
negotiation that for example like the BB

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:30,020
you have to say well can we say that the

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:33,470
database is complete outside or before

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:35,750
or the scope well yes you can but

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,750
actually the data that is stored in the

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,000
database that's more or less court on

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,450
the application sleep in databases

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,160
outside of the scope the data is sound

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,860
in the database must be integrally

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,210
connected so even if the database sound

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,850
busy and insecure then the tape myself

00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:58,430
secure that you put into it so and then

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,770
you have to ask the lab is that okay to

00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,270
you know don't care about anything about

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,640
which is all there none of them would

00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,430
say no of those have some integrity

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,680
protection etc so you can negotiate a

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,230
little bit you can probably negotiate to

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,250
have configuration outside recycle

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,820
center so you want to try to make it as

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:23,060
easy as possible for you but still

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:26,950
provide fulfilling the requirements and

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,950
having a decent physical

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:35,830
the next functional specification there

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,750
you have to well you're not supposed to

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:41,740
be able to read all this because I

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:44,110
completely myself but it you have to

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,680
actually define all the modules in your

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:49,870
software and the interactions between so

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,340
we have put all your modules here and

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,220
they have to figure out which more

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,610
dimples where walks etc so we can get

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,110
pretty complicated and that's only you

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,230
know the first step or the functional

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:05,380
specification the second step is that

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:09,700
you have to get into more detail you

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:12,690
have to define all the you have modules

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,690
and you have

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,690
Oh

00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,529
functions and well there are three

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,809
things and they are named differently in

00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:28,800
different documents so i will get back

00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:32,730
to that also slightly later so you have

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,230
to define a very kind of detail you have

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,019
for instance certificate and profile

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,189
management typical component of a CA and

00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,189
there you have to define that their

00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:44,100
certificate profiles so you have a crl

00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:46,949
profiles and you have a Sierra issue and

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,139
so she can skip the dishes and you also

00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:52,800
have to define folded individual

00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:56,360
functions so it gets fairly hairy with

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,949
details so this is just one example of a

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,809
one thing that is required in the

00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:03,300
protection from flood that we use is a

00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:05,669
backup or restore and then you have to

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:08,039
describe very much in detail this is the

00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:09,390
restore function so you have to say

00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,339
what's the purpose of the restore

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,459
function well to restore a backup of

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,899
course how do you use it and what inputs

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,480
they have while the previous image

00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:21,689
backup is input to restore a force and

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,730
what actions thus the resort I can do

00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:27,839
and what's the output well it's and

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:30,320
restore tue and whatever mess suggest

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,409
what security event the log events

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,130
happens etc and finally and you also

00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:37,130
have to define

00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:43,230
security target what is called in SF our

00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:47,720
security functional requirements so we

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:51,179
have to link this function to what

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,220
security requirements bassett fulfill so

00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,019
then everything can be back-traced to

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,940
back and forth to see that well we have

00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:59,519
these requirements and that requirement

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,789
is implemented by the restore function

00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:06,359
and restore functioning collapse these

00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:08,369
requirements and finally also have to

00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:13,220
say which interfaces this is available

00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:13,220
from and this is there some

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,300
later on when you actually test up if

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,050
you have a lot of interfaces you have

00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:26,150
likely this is more money interface you

00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,910
can also web interface web service

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:31,130
interface and have to make tests for all

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:34,240
these interfaces that you define that

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,240
the function is available

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,850
we have design specification later on

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:47,370
which in some way describes the same

00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,830
things but in a different way so you

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,960
have filled my captain recovery you

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,810
describe well what does factor from our

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,550
group again and then you have to say

00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:59,550
which interactions it has with other

00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:02,340
modules so well to make a backyard we

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:04,770
had access control to see that you are

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,600
authorized to make it back out we have

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,460
key management for encryption or

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,800
signature keys for the background and

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,380
final eight years it has graduated

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,470
security audits modules actually make to

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,670
log that we did perform a backup you

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:23,460
have to describe all these

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:25,410
interconnections in detail and the most

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,260
confusing thing one of the most

00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:32,430
confusing most confusing things I think

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:34,830
is that you have that you need complete

00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,450
mappings between all these documents so

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,060
if you describe something in the

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,070
functional specification corresponding

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,620
things has to be described in the sign

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,870
specification and it has to match

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,970
something in implementation as well so

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,590
it's not something is missing to

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,230
describe something here and you don't

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:55,290
have the same thing there the lab would

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:57,570
complain that's after we can describe

00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,179
something there you don't have a some

00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:03,809
implement it of course they will

00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:05,759
and make it more confusing they actually

00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:08,580
hold things differently in different

00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,169
documents so inflectional specification

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,749
you have something called a functional

00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:15,090
module but in the Desai's specification

00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:17,129
is called a subsystem and in the

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:20,700
implementation well we use Java so it

00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:22,019
corresponds to java package in the

00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,629
function specification you have an

00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:26,999
interface but in the size space calcium

00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:29,610
is called a volume but in the bunch of

00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:32,369
vegetation this one was fully mobile so

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,019
you get a bit confused when you work

00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:36,450
with this and it's all well a module

00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:39,210
that was a multi-mode it's not important

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:44,029
that was an interface that's a model and

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,029
now that's an interface over there so

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,520
that's the course a lot of heaven

00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,700
so before I start to become a criteria I

00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:59,190
surely have a lot of prejudice about

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,549
Common Criteria and I'm sure madam you

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,289
had a lot of prejudices about computers

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:07,229
especially if you haven't actually go

00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:11,159
through one yourself so how many have

00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:15,119
gone through one yourself that's still

00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:20,100
the measure now that's the best crowd so

00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:24,509
far well sound prejudices well it's

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:26,549
expensive it's a waste of time just

00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:29,820
paperwork doesn't you know to Anna

00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:32,309
technical stuff certified products are

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,909
only old versions you can easily get

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:40,289
that feeling and why should certified

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:42,690
for electrolux actually be better but

00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:45,720
there are some that some prejudices that

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,119
some of them I had and some of them are

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:52,769
still have some vampire I have actually

00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:57,149
converted into other producers so the

00:21:52,769 --> 00:22:00,389
truth but my truth about comic idea it

00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:03,629
does take a lot of take a lot of time so

00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:06,259
that's the Pegasus certainly true and it

00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:09,419
does cost a very kind of a lot of money

00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:13,229
but it's not the only paper it's really

00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:15,720
technical evaluation the tons of course

00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:16,580
a little bit of each evaluation never go

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,220
to

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:23,510
the one we live for plus is quite

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:27,200
technical it's true that certified

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:30,440
versions are no we got acted a little

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,750
bit so I mean you never have the latest

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,919
version is never the one that this acoma

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:38,840
fatir so Piper it does provide actually

00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:42,860
product improvements need to do it's the

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,690
kind of properly and it will improve

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:48,190
security in your product during

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:53,120
evaluation unless you have an extremely

00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:56,029
good processive already before I would

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,850
say this rare one of the things most

00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:00,860
striking is that comet right there sings

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,169
of this effort and methodologies to the

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:06,799
fight before even starting to invite

00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:09,799
your product but almost everybody unit

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,200
after a fax everything has been designed

00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:15,620
everything so you're representing and

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,460
adding and really rounding the corners

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,460
but you

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:32,980
my to design all the useful if business

00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:32,980
comes first process comes later Lester

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:42,240
for inception and those

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,240
almost no tactical the expectations

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,960
singing about small community the first

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:55,029
version

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,029
go subscribe and after I don't think

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:04,710
second generation of you I'm thinking

00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:08,590
about cas and I think it's about

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:11,590
teenager that's done after

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:15,640
that's what he is

00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:18,669
I'll think from the either case even

00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,190
need to do it before well if you and do

00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:22,690
it with inception your development of

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,880
the first version will be a hell of a

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,490
lot more expensive than if you didn't do

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,200
it before so it's still a concern of the

00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:33,159
money it takes a lot of time your

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,909
development is slowly from sorry etc so

00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:35,909
but of course

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:44,370
other common prejudices purse from a

00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:46,740
user perspective that means you know the

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:49,470
government's or actually requires this

00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,570
is that such a certification should

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,660
guarantee secure software what are the

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,520
personal of course says certification is

00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,520
not worth anything can also be produced

00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,620
well it is so probably somewhere in

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,020
between here it's worth something but it

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:09,530
definitely doesn't guarantee the secure

00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:11,850
so true that's because the CC actually

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,790
assures with a certain level of

00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,950
assurance which is this EA LML that the

00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,750
product works as documented that the

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,150
Chandler and the key word here is

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:25,860
documented so with you document that

00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:28,230
your product thus doesn't do something

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,080
or you don't document that it does

00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,940
something doesn't care the evaluation

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,840
doesn't care what your software doesn't

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:39,720
do they will be careful to save us so

00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,780
that's why protection profiles as your

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:47,210
targets are important because they are

00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:50,250
the predefined security requirements and

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,990
the key with that is that actually these

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,020
protective properties and security

00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:58,799
targets that's I would say one issue

00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,260
become ketheria that's in this standard

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,150
it's supposed that actually the use

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,640
be able to read the affection profile

00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,920
for a secure target and make some kind

00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,400
of judgment this is these products

00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,830
evaluated what I want or up and they

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,740
evaluated in order functions that are

00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:18,600
not interested but of course these

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,210
documents are way too complex for any

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,550
normal and you say unity government i

00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,740
would say three today so we practice is

00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:31,760
not possible they just you know check

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:34,230
for ATM for class so it must be good and

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,180
from that also follows the different

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:39,690
vendors are different products like HSN

00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:42,660
they can claim that well our products as

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:46,020
certified lil Elizabeth our competitors

00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:48,230
products only certified part because you

00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,910
know everyone just looks at this and

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:54,890
it's too hard to react to read and

00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:54,890
understand booty sassiness good party

00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,490
for the developer

00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,860
it's very hard and cumbersome to keep

00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:13,710
track of all the details and mappings in

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:17,070
these documents so and actually I mean

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:19,590
these Sloan Lisa documents yo me as a

00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:22,470
developer you bet not only do that if

00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:25,560
you get paid for it no one will ever

00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,870
dream about in this one was so that's

00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,210
why most commonly i would say these

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:34,130
documents are at least two large part

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:37,200
written by consultants because too

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:40,040
boring cumbersome difficult actually to

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,040
get too bright

00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:46,779
the certification can both provide some

00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:48,519
refactorings if you have something

00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:51,369
certified you don't want to change it a

00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,950
lot but on the other hand if you're

00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:56,590
doing certification and you think well

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:59,919
we should do this right then it actually

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:02,320
will encourage and refactoring to make

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:06,989
it so you have with significant right

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,989
sacrifice version thank you

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,769
very significant

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,400
much larger art

00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,350
generate the switch away

00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,570
perfect

00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,880
these are the rewritable effectors they

00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:37,100
are situated and very large part

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,500
documentation ireland gets generated

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,750
from its horses

00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:45,110
static effect

00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:47,800
so you tried not to write a little try

00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,800
to shoot

00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:58,390
that's possible to some extent i would

00:28:52,059 --> 00:29:05,020
say but you can't really generate these

00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:07,390
documents from think this project in a

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,730
way we have tried to control in the

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,760
sense that we did the project first

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:15,779
called common criteria which is an API

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:19,919
for for our CA and then some other

00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:23,169
products as well and it turns out that

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,700
even in creating and creating an API I

00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:27,850
think everyone would agree with me is

00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:30,370
very very difficult for them if you are

00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:33,520
successful I think you get wear what you

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:36,220
want to be but I think being successful

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,330
in this is very difficult disability

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,330
possible in some

00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:50,010
this recognizes a big problem

00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:52,580
very often you see software model set

00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,580
very

00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,280
this all comes as equals

00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:09,360
so one things are gross

00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:13,250
to open a social

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,250
is whether a run some school

00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,150
need to take a step back

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:22,360
at the end

00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,870
no steps away is the same way before

00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,250
something you got to suffer on this

00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:31,390
we had the struggle with

00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,390
liability issue an accountant

00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:46,820
actually it's a candle what we did so I

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:50,750
will actually show some architecture of

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:55,160
that just in exercise so will they get

00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:58,210
back to the dental work but just finally

00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,550
that the your certification is to

00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:03,020
explore a developer perspective it's not

00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:05,690
just you know something that you have to

00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,700
overcome we actually do get from the

00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:10,790
certification lat very good input and

00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,470
testing the certification lab really are

00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,910
there to help you they are not

00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,800
interested in stopping you from getting

00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,600
suffocation they are of course

00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,390
interested in your product getting

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,380
certified but they pay for them usually

00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:26,870
nice guy so they would help you to

00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:30,410
interpret the requirements in a good way

00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:35,450
for you etc and the test your product

00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:39,200
very much so how much does it cost is a

00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:41,930
common question but for us it took like

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,080
two years we have at least three to four

00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:48,350
people full-time during one year full

00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:51,790
year and just the lab testing lab costs

00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:54,169
more than 50,000 Europe so it's a very

00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,879
expensive process so

00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:59,779
at least you know couple hundred

00:31:55,879 --> 00:32:01,669
thousand you doing this valuation so

00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:06,980
it's not for the weak-hearted I would

00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:10,009
say so to be more very specific for open

00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,539
source if open source going to

00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:14,529
discriminate the bike commute idea

00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:19,970
because it's so tuned for other

00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:21,559
proprietary software both yes and no the

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:24,529
same requirements are probe the source

00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:27,200
and proprietary software from cali risen

00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:29,389
character source for is open or closed

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,789
it's not security by obscurity in any

00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:33,379
way and there's no requirement that you

00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:37,580
can't fulfill we know free source

00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:40,909
software on the other hand yes because

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,879
it's quite strict control our repository

00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:45,470
committers so that's not step into not

00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:49,519
the perfect match for a community-driven

00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:51,649
project where you don't know everyone

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,830
there is no universe in your entity that

00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:58,009
knows all commenters and where you have

00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:01,039
souls forever host or accepted the

00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:04,100
lifecycle requirements requires very

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:07,190
tight control over how we handle issues

00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:10,279
etc so we kinda make forces a slightly

00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:12,799
centralized development work and of

00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:16,509
course is very high cost so it requires

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:20,789
actually some company with as enough

00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:24,549
money to live the paper application and

00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:28,649
all this i would say particular the high

00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:32,469
cost leads to that there's virtually

00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:36,369
very few publicly downloadable comic at

00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:39,059
a certified open source of the source

00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:39,059
software

00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:44,500
you like to eat or something where you

00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,500
have

00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:50,580
touches for her mother

00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:53,879
I will not work with a

00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,879
control with a

00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:05,860
I guess the the entity who actually

00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:09,160
assembles the final software which shows

00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:12,550
the official certified version has to

00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:15,370
have control of and multiples and aware

00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:18,670
so is there you know there's someone who

00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,560
pulls into that can official release

00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:24,550
version and then you have to have

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,429
control over adults people which others

00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,839
like a factual

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,839
exactly the same problems

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,270
yr

00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,740
something shifts from that

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,839
no requirement the number technical

00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:07,540
requirement against open source that

00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:11,349
their purchases in all the human parts

00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:14,579
of the process and so the lab is usually

00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:14,579
not no problem

00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,900
evaluator

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:26,090
they're not taking that would have to

00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:30,950
still do some kind of ventilation events

00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:33,170
alleviation human parts of you have to

00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,410
select the lab carefully then of course

00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:39,080
we you know have the obvious a

00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:41,210
procurement for the certification where

00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,400
we had three different labs between the

00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,890
wrong person we choose that French lab

00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,710
which had worked with open source before

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:51,010
so they know what it is summer more

00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,010
patties

00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:57,099
you seem to know they can you name some

00:35:54,099 --> 00:36:04,930
other open source things that are going

00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:07,779
criteria yep looks like so the other

00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:10,499
thing that this kind of non open open

00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:15,160
source about commercial carries that

00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:17,529
comic fer processes I would say like an

00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,689
extreme waterfall process the document

00:36:17,529 --> 00:36:22,329
first an increment later and you have to

00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:26,170
have everything Superdog method that is

00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:28,809
not caliber so agile as most common most

00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:31,209
open source project for today so you can

00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:34,900
kind of see that rickety approach this

00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:37,630
all cemented you know some years ago so

00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,640
CC computer definitely not created you

00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,589
know with facts development x ability in

00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,359
mind it's a rather way down the way

00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:45,670
you're on this very static extremely

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,609
static once you have a certified worship

00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:50,199
with an investor in a specific

00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:52,359
environment which means a specific

00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:53,430
version of operating system specific

00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,530
version applications

00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,839
server hardware security module with a

00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:59,579
specific former version that is a

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,319
certified version that's other

00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,510
elementals any comments right here and

00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:05,309
there just because you have to do the

00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,140
evaluation and you have to do the

00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:09,839
testing on all those platforms of you

00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,660
usually limit yourself to one yeah yeah

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,880
two in our case but i think this that's

00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:17,430
also you know you have this static one

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,829
but of course you have a security flight

00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:21,960
control operating system even for public

00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:23,940
security modules but then when you apply

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,859
the security patches your operating

00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:30,930
system that's no longer in a certified

00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:34,619
version but that's some other things how

00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:36,540
it's supposed to be used or not but you

00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,710
can do some things to remedy this

00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,950
there's something called impact

00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,569
assessment if you do go fix a patch you

00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,550
make an impact assessment to say about

00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:47,130
this as doesn't affect any of the

00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,170
security functions and then you're the

00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,119
users are supposed to read this and say

00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,440
well of course is better to use this new

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,190
pump certified version than the old

00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,470
certified because they are actually

00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:01,980
certified working as security box is

00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:04,950
newer version doesn't and of course you

00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,910
can do recertification which is jacked

00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,280
on you

00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,920
process but still if you have all the

00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:15,450
documents kind of in shape and then of

00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,490
course that's a lot cheaper please this

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,890
leads to that there are very few of the

00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:22,069
source products which are certified only

00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:26,250
from larger companies red hat enterprise

00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:29,510
linux tables of course the enterprise

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:32,220
version is certified IBM phone as

00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:35,069
certified versions factor Frankie there

00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:38,369
we're not a large company it looks funny

00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:40,470
who didn't and of course they're even

00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:42,480
fewer that are publicly available you

00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:45,569
know even rather they are certified that

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,309
Pitino rest lyrics it's not publicly

00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:49,920
downloadable although it's open source

00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:53,579
and unfortunately it's going to be the

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:57,630
same with our software is just too

00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:59,880
expensive so that's also one that's

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,039
probably the biggest thing that is kind

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,950
of against the source of comfort here

00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,620
it's a

00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:08,690
but on the other hand I mean there are

00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,820
probably lots of professor for products

00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:13,610
that are built on open source which are

00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:16,880
certified if you get like a certified

00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:19,370
product from my damn we do snow polka

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,400
source of activities in space on a

00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:25,430
hatchet princess so in that way apache

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,290
is certainly certified but you can't you

00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:29,740
know go to actually evolving at the

00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,740
certified

00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:38,960
so this is what we did with kind of

00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:44,420
relates back to their questions before

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:47,450
we kind of did things actually shifted

00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:50,650
way a little bit but we have this vca

00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:54,619
product and what we did is we took the

00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:57,619
security functions from the Java code

00:39:54,619 --> 00:40:01,070
and we broke it out into a separate new

00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:04,910
of making you a library Angela pass

00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:07,760
component library and refactor to fit

00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:10,760
you know good as good as we can make it

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,250
and we software and the modules which

00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,530
cannot reflects and security

00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:19,190
requirements etc and then we certified

00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:21,619
first this component library and then

00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:24,820
the second step is that we took this

00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:29,300
newly certified component library and we

00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:32,540
refactored it into a GBC a again to make

00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,220
ed bc a certified ER so first we certify

00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:38,680
the component library and then we put it

00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,680
in 2d dca and we certified a UPC

00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:45,920
that this call is a composite evaluation

00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:49,010
where we have actually one certified

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,980
book something certified inside another

00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:54,140
product that makes it a little easier to

00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:58,010
certify this product because it will

00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:02,920
Sakura has been a court certified so in

00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:06,200
that way we actually tune this one to

00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:08,930
hopefully be a little bit more static

00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,880
than this low software and so that the

00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,980
certification parts where the certified

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,990
part would change less and be easier to

00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:19,490
recertify something that's an important

00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,910
and as this include things are as

00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:26,510
architect we miss you

00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:26,510
you prove that and this is an end point

00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:35,890
it always goes further better definitely

00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:38,500
so there are a lot of things that we

00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:40,750
want to improve or reddit but once you

00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:46,690
change something sorcerer fighting but

00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:50,680
that's something I have some more what

00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:52,570
we did the l4 plus and we had a luckily

00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,090
there is a protection profile for city

00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:59,470
food authorities so we could use that is

00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:01,930
for the cimc there's a commodity

00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:03,640
reversion where we actually this

00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:06,400
protection profile was actually written

00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,380
by list some years ago and it was

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,420
written for an older version from Katie

00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,220
reversion to Allah plan when you search

00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,170
by something today is comic interior

00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,780
working three dot one so you have to

00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,410
change some things to adapted to the new

00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,900
phone

00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:22,300
version so that's also you know that

00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:25,780
protection profiles are a bit you know

00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:28,690
too static it's valid for like two years

00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:31,090
and unless miss miss feels like they

00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:33,520
want to spend a lot of time you wanted

00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:36,660
to update the protection profile it's

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,660
you have to do it yourself

00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:43,319
what is different in open source

00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:44,670
comparative proprietary software and one

00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:48,180
thing is that we have a public

00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:50,249
repository code repository in the

00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,890
proprietary software companies usually

00:42:50,249 --> 00:42:56,609
have strict control over development

00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:59,160
machines they have been nowhere from for

00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:01,259
developers are and who develops they

00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,759
have legal control over developments

00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:04,759
because they are employed by the company

00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:12,450
so what can we do as an open source

00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:14,210
project well to have kind of claim to

00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:17,369
have control of and development machines

00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:19,710
we have a user responsibility policy

00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:22,349
that the Ultimatrix must sign it's

00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:25,019
nothing special adjusted basically that

00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:31,829
you yes I have some you know malware

00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:34,739
protection some firewall etc so to wear

00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:37,710
so the committee has to say that yes I

00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:40,049
have some best efforts control that my

00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:41,100
machine is not affected by hammer they

00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:45,180
see

00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:47,310
that where development is done from

00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:50,250
actually that doesn't matter as long as

00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:53,460
you have some authentication and

00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:55,620
encryption so HTTPS and authentication

00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:59,880
is good you can sit wherever in the

00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:02,970
world you were thinking the same is with

00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:06,000
some this legal controller who develops

00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:10,250
that this Latin have some contractor

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,410
this user possibility to politic

00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:16,670
huh

00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:23,840
so that what affects our product project

00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:26,870
the most is this alc lifecycle the life

00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:29,450
cycle in the computer requirements it

00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:31,460
actually requires that control access to

00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:34,370
that source code repository which means

00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:36,590
both logically am physically and we

00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:39,950
previously had our repository

00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:41,780
sourceforge no more because there's no

00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:44,530
way the certification lab can go to

00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:47,870
small sportcam you know evaluate their

00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:50,660
posting facility so we have to move to

00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:52,400
our own hosting so the lab could

00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,640
actually come visit our soul group to

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,140
see that well the badges with codes

00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,710
multi-tracks and things like that fire

00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,710
perfection

00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:06,200
we also need a lot of processes for easy

00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:08,870
management code review testing release

00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,490
management not released because it has

00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,470
to be

00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:15,290
release management is very important

00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:19,100
because the certified release has to be

00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:21,410
authentic Authenticator for the person

00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,850
who uses a release must be able to

00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,850
authenticate this better

00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:30,430
and so what we had to do told you about

00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:32,800
this use responsibility policy all staff

00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:35,980
and the external commuter had to change

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,310
and to sign a use responsibility probe

00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:42,880
for policy and we have to access lists

00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:46,270
who has access to our repository both

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,130
you know logically and physically and

00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:50,800
for experiment makers we use the same

00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:55,350
user possibility policy and we have a

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,350
review process completely

00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:03,090
otherwise we weren't affected too much

00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:05,410
actually because we have fairly good

00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:07,990
processes already thanks to town there

00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:10,680
and we had JIRA issue management to

00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:15,190
cycle the inspection also on no

00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:17,680
continuous integration etc so we didn't

00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,730
have to change our processes well the

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,330
most thing we have to change the

00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:24,790
repository and introduces access list so

00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:27,250
this more administration we takes more

00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:30,040
time now we have to do a little more a

00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:31,840
key way than before for each issue which

00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,880
means that this slightly slower

00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,130
development and before you know it can't

00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,800
be as fast as when you're not satisfied

00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:41,770
i would say the other hand you get

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,310
Elizabeth Republic assures per issue so

00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:46,900
actually you do just slightly that and

00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:50,760
say

00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:56,789
from our for Alice a our software is

00:46:50,760 --> 00:47:00,430
better and better structure hopeful a

00:46:56,789 --> 00:47:04,630
slightly more secure slightly better

00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:07,029
festive so the code has definitely

00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:09,220
gained from our certification but the

00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:13,270
test taking a lot of time cause a lotta

00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:16,029
money which forced us to change some

00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:20,309
things which maybe we were that we

00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:20,309
definitely will not have changed unless

00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,850
that's it

00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:31,130
do you have like some specific things in

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:35,300
the code base you can point out that

00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:41,150
were the result of or feedback from the

00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:44,450
lab or something again yes we thought

00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:46,780
that we didn't not have any SQL

00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:51,470
injection vulnerabilities because we had

00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:53,510
definitely check that many times but

00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:55,610
they found i'll actually but that's what

00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:57,650
all the API level so I don't think we've

00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:59,840
been in action have it from you on the

00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:02,870
web interface but we have it in the API

00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:06,290
level so now we even from the API level

00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:10,970
it's doesn't happen not that we know

00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:14,750
what about that's one thing I mean like

00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:17,750
additions and components or changes

00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:21,080
around there are some planet components

00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:24,940
especially in the API which we put in

00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,940
the CC cool part we have to put

00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:35,040
yeah in this API here we have like their

00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:37,080
function for backup and recovery because

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,670
you had to have to have that and we love

00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,340
this doesn't have it all and I need to

00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:43,349
pay for anything so we have a Java you

00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:47,790
know API components for backup recovery

00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:50,490
which kind of sucks so but we had to we

00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:54,060
must have those functions so we have to

00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:55,830
my counter eucalyptus in some functions

00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,470
just to be able to fulfill all

00:48:55,830 --> 00:49:01,290
requirements and pass all the tests but

00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:04,140
down here we you know we won't use those

00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:06,390
so that's scheduled a sham functions

00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,700
just to pass this component library

00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:10,320
through certification but we don't use

00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,590
them down here he reads the news

00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:16,830
component interface to lose basically

00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:18,900
the same so there are some dad up some

00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:21,330
stuff for audit logs as well and some

00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,980
other things which I find very very

00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:26,070
useful but we probably would have done

00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:29,490
anyway that's probably a decibel channel

00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:31,920
that some sh and five functions which we

00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:33,650
had to introduce the other probably the

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,970
best thing as some studies of the

00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:41,160
security audit now with awesome this

00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:42,800
well specified exactly what this

00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,080
security audit

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:49,140
protected security audit we need a

00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:52,520
signature range map and it's you know

00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:55,110
all a home code that's not true very

00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,600
meticulously to ensure that the security

00:49:55,110 --> 00:50:00,770
all that is exactly are specified in

00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:06,170
sadness or requirements etc so that's

00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:06,170
that has been a lot better before

00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,530
a location goes through the certify and

00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,950
that's me

00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:17,100
hard to play for sale

00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:20,570
surprise

00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,570
so we sometimes see is that

00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:25,960
will be made stronger

00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:29,670
or security market environment stronger

00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,670
and so like naked much easier

00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:32,539
in peace

00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,079
it's very common for

00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:45,240
and did you find you have to do the same

00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:45,240
thing in here as well or was that

00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,609
would say not

00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:57,680
so it's a no only kind of sound

00:50:54,930 --> 00:51:01,569
engineering

00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,569
and then so like the surface tension

00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:18,400
which wish HSN to the target safe now

00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:23,050
Luna and you tomato and yeah we serve

00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:27,190
vital to Task Force one was rather than

00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:32,440
price Gables and postgresql with safe

00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:37,620
nap Luna HSM the other one no waiting

00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:43,650
around Windows Server MySQL node and

00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:48,130
you'd make up crypto server glassfish

00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:51,610
application and from the shack own

00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:55,240
website at least there should be like

00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:58,330
this is eg BCA you see right center a

00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:01,410
topic death what are the other

00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:05,110
applications to be built around the core

00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:08,290
so we have this project was actually a

00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:10,180
corporation then in order to get picked

00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:13,510
up some funding from the EU which we go

00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,000
through this we have just us and Maureen

00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:16,370
you come

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,190
português company and the Turkish

00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:22,790
company so we have a taste around it the

00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:26,920
Portuguese has I'm stamp server built on

00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:26,920
top of it and the others

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,859
the CIA profiles

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,529
out here

00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:41,710
is there any chance that what's going to

00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:41,710
you

00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,650
with a vector profile

00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,380
five part of problem

00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:58,660
but then I mean the saying that the

00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:01,150
protection profile is actually updated

00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:04,060
and of not valid anymore but that's also

00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:06,910
a negotiation between the lab and the

00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:09,850
application authority this certification

00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:11,620
body that they you know agree that well

00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:15,480
if we do this changes to me so to take

00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:15,480
the profile we can see a plan for bugs

00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:34,520
anssi across and the lab was popular

00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:37,760
citation evaluation what good night

00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:42,280
so we're not we're very happy with that

00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,280
