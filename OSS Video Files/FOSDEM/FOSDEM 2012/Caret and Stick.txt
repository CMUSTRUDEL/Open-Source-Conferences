	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,750
so let me introduce myself I'm a master

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,420
student I study ICT in business in

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,330
Leiden I've been involved with several

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,170
flask communities over the past 10 years

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,740
and I formerly worked as a software

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,170
developer the research that I'm doing

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,880
for my degree focuses on open source

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,890
communities and rather than looking at

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,189
smaller communities who consist entirely

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,140
of volunteers I am specifically looking

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,770
at larger communities where you get

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,850
volunteers paid people may be a few

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,530
companies involved now I'm going to

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,950
start by giving you a quick introduction

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,350
to research that's been done on open

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,899
source on the open source software

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,399
development and then I'm going to talk a

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,110
little bit about the things that I've

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,780
noticed when I talk to people from my

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,719
research and I hope that I can give the

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,019
people who are in these more complicated

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,330
communities a few guidelines of things

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,950
to think about when you pay people and

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,780
what the effects of that are on your

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:20,070
community on your projects ecosystem as

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:23,070
a whole so we've had about 10 to 15

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,750
years of research in open source

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,420
communities and the people that are

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,600
researching this come from come from a

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,329
quite a large background at quite a

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,689
varied academic background we've got

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,009
economic economists in there we've got

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,549
people interested in software

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,990
engineering in there people from Social

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,939
Sciences who are trying to figure out

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,619
how we do things legal people and just

00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:52,700
the very basics which kinds of

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,700
applications are we making

00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:03,400
I'm interested in how we develop the

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,230
software not the technical specifics of

00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,450
it but how do the people interact with

00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:10,090
each other what is motivating people to

00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:14,140
do this and this is a little bit more

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,570
detail about the papers that are

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,570
published the kinds of scientific and

00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,370
scholarly interests that there is in our

00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,940
communities and as you can see there's

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:30,700
quite a lot of interest in motivation

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:34,420
now motivation focuses on why we create

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,700
this open-source software because open

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:41,500
source developers are a little bit weird

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:44,260
for economists we have a very good skill

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,830
set we can make a lot of money with the

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:51,040
skills we have and very often we do but

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:53,890
for some bizarre reason we contribute

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,770
all of this time and energy often for

00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:04,630
free td's of random projects we're all

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:06,310
working on and the conclusion because

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,640
they spend a bit five years debating

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,850
this and yet they concluded well there's

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,800
a lot of extrinsic motivation I'm from

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:19,180
the previous speaker briefly talked

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,090
about having your name in the commit log

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,800
for the project that's an example of

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,840
extrinsic motivation another very

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,030
typical example is if you're getting

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,800
paid I don't know if anybody here is

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:36,220
getting paid to develop open source

00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:39,100
software quite a few p quite a few

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,989
people if you go look at research it's

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,959
something between 16 and forty percent

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:50,230
of all the people working on open source

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:51,820
that are being paid to do it now next to

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,640
this extrinsic motivation which

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,110
economists think that we that is the

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,820
core thing that motivates all of us

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,760
which is why they want to pay us for our

00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,700
jobs apparently we have a lot of

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,120
intrinsic motivation we just really

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,460
really like what we're doing we feel

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,320
good when we write

00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,860
code we feel good when we give it to

00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:18,790
other people and on top of that because

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,340
we are not black and white people we've

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,920
managed to internalize some extrinsic

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:28,090
motivation motivation this would be

00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,070
things like I contribute back to the

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:36,280
project that I'm working on because I

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:37,960
use their code I should be doing it now

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:43,570
this is still very black-and-white we've

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,610
introduced a small shade of gray so

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:49,810
afterwards a lot of other research has

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,420
been done that looks at the small the

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,240
smaller detriments of why we do what we

00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,460
do and then people go and look at what's

00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,760
the effect of the license type what's

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,460
the effect of the size of the community

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,340
what's the effect of the people that are

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,080
known to the communities fenders if you

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,220
start a project you draw in your friends

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,860
first and they draw in some other

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:17,800
friends how does how does that shape

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:21,070
your community a little bit of a problem

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,290
is that we've always looked in research

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:28,240
we've always looked at individual

00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:32,470
developers and any change we look at

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,120
okay we've changed this thing now do we

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,070
get more developers less developers but

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:41,380
it's always focused on one specific

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:45,070
developer I've include I've included

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,140
some reference um references at the end

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,110
there's a URL where you can find a lot

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:57,210
more references if you want to read up

00:05:50,110 --> 00:06:01,810
on all of this stuff yourself so we know

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,700
that we can that we have nice very

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,260
intrinsically motivated developers who

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,370
are willing to do a lot of stuff for us

00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:12,900
in there in a free time but at some

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:15,250
point that developer also needs to eat

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,900
you might graduate from height from

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,310
University and he needs to get a real

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:23,200
job the bills still have to be paid now

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,930
traditional thinking is that when

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:31,350
you start paying people you remove their

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:35,610
intrinsic motivation surprisingly enough

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:39,100
for open source that doesn't hold

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:43,060
somebody went in and did the research

00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:46,120
and concluded that if you pay

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,670
open-source people they are still

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,620
equally intrinsically motivated but they

00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,540
get a little bit more motivation

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,920
motivation because of the money you're

00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:04,270
spending on them but as i already said

00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:06,670
that's one individual developer so if

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,370
you're the lucky community that has a

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:13,060
lot of money or if you're a company and

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:15,760
you want opens you want volunteers to

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,420
work on your open source project what

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,970
kind of stuff do you want to pay for

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:26,950
this is one of the things I asked people

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:30,280
in interviews if it's your choice what

00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:32,920
kind of work do you pay for and people

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,370
are pretty much in agreement with each

00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,660
other and they talked about how they pay

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,570
for things that you can't do as a

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,850
volunteer because the time involvement

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,030
it requires is too long or because the

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:48,220
work is too complex they talk about one

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:53,680
thing to pay for work that volunteers

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:58,200
don't want to do it's boring work a lot

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,300
of QA is to a lot of people very boring

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,380
bugs that are not very common don't get

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,120
fixed you might want to pay for that

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,130
some people talk about wanting to pay

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,550
for skills that are not available in the

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:16,960
community if you have a financial

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,960
package and you need to add very

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,930
specific accounting practices you want

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,910
to talk to an accountant and try to get

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,280
them involved as an engineer as a as a

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:30,930
volunteer but being an economist you

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,930
might not be that interested in that

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,190
a fourth thing you want to pay for as

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,950
time crit is work that is time critical

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:44,660
or work that needs to be done in a

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:46,640
certain way a typical example would be

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:51,050
keeping service running twenty-four

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,560
seven and why paying paying for this

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,030
work does not make somebody better at it

00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:02,270
but it's in general a little bit easier

00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:04,730
to fix it if it goes wrong and the

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,070
biggest surprise that I got when I asked

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,050
people what would you pay for is that

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,840
people say you need to pay for community

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,930
management you need to make sure that

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:19,270
it's somebody's task to keep everybody

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,270
happy and involved and productive

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:28,330
there's a few different ways that you

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:31,550
can pay people you can just hire people

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:36,050
here's a here's a contract for the hours

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:39,860
per week no end date on the contract you

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:42,260
can hire people for specific jobs one of

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,860
the most well-known examples of this

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:50,240
would be google Summer of Code we're in

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:52,820
this case students get money for

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,000
spending a few months on a particular

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,310
project that they agree on what the

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,380
community they're going to work for but

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,740
you can also just say I'm country I'm

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:08,830
contracting out a rewrite of the UI of

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:13,090
our program you can have binding systems

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:15,920
where you say for this job so much money

00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:18,500
$200 that take two thousand dollar is

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,720
available for a particular feature you

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,300
want implemented one of the nice things

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,860
about banking systems is that everybody

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,470
else can add more money to the pile and

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,950
everybody sort of has an easy input in

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,990
what's important to do are you getting

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,000
your are you can spend your money in a

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,700
very different way and rather than

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,980
directly paying people you can reward

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,790
them by paying their travel to a

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:49,070
conference or by inviting them over if

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,600
company for instance and there's a

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,090
volunteer in the community around your

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,740
product whose very well-versed in a

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,470
particular topic you can invite that

00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:06,140
person over to come and explain it to

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:10,310
your engineers so now that we know what

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:15,140
to pay for and how we can work out this

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:16,520
payment who are we going to pay on the

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:21,170
one hand you can pay the existing

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:23,420
volunteers it's a solution if you need

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,310
more time from your people but that's

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,290
not really going to work if you need a

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:32,980
specific expertise that's currently not

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:34,910
available so you can bring in outsiders

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,920
outsiders are not well versed in the

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:47,540
communities and sometimes forget they're

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:49,660
newbies before I set that open source

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,100
developers if you give them money they

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:55,910
get more mod there they get more

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:58,790
motivated it's still a big question

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:07,180
whether that holds true at a community

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:10,970
level whether if I give developer John a

00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:14,350
monthly salary will develop our Mike

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:19,190
still be interested in doing anything

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:23,360
what happens if I give Susan a six-month

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:25,700
contract to rewrite the you i will Jane

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,720
still be interested in doing anything

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:35,240
else and that's where my research is

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,090
focused so volunteers versus paid staff

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,640
they don't always work well together

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:42,410
sometimes they work very well together

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,110
there's a few things that you should

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:51,140
probably keep in mind and I going to go

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:56,420
over these first of all how accessible

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:59,279
is your project really i think almost

00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,079
all open source projects use

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:07,589
a version control system is there

00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:09,660
anybody here who does not how long does

00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:14,790
it take to get access to your version

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:21,180
control system for a new developer a day

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:23,629
a week a month how long does it take

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,860
when that new developer is an employee

00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:32,670
it usually takes about a day in that

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:34,829
case otherwise you're wasting money but

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:40,019
let's assume that is very easy to get

00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:44,249
access to your repository is all the

00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:46,350
code in the repository companies that

00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:49,529
want to have a community around our

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,809
project aren't always as quick to update

00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:54,990
the external facing repository as they

00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:57,029
could be so you end up with volunteers

00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:03,170
working on things have already been

00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:07,579
fixed not a great way to motivate people

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,579
how hard is it to understand your code

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:14,519
where is the document that describes the

00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:16,339
architecture of the code is that

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,949
something that's publicly available is

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:21,660
that hidden in the source code or is

00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:34,850
that something that only lives inside

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:40,589
your organization how transparent is

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:43,949
your software development how are you

00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:46,290
making your decisions is it somebody at

00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:48,769
the highest level of the company that

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:53,089
decides these are the features we need

00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:56,339
or is it the engineers that decide this

00:14:53,089 --> 00:15:00,269
the volunteers developers get the

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,679
volunteer developers get a say in the

00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:05,279
decisions that are made in the

00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:09,089
priorities that are in the list of

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,540
priorities for the project if you're

00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:14,660
having a meeting

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:18,199
to talk about anything related to the

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,829
project is that meeting open to people

00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:23,240
that are not employees and if that

00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:25,699
meeting is open to people that are not

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,639
employees are you doing it at a time

00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:34,160
that non-employees can join you in your

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:37,130
meeting is a meeting during business

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:45,170
hours it's hard to attend if you're not

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:48,199
paid to do it these are two these are

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:51,560
the two biggest things that came out of

00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:53,420
my research so far and they seem to be

00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,720
under light they seem to be under lied

00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:01,579
by another thing none of these things is

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:04,220
caused by paying money directly but when

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:07,630
you pay people you are entering into a

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,630
different kind of contract with them

00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:15,829
volunteers work on things they want they

00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:19,010
work on things when they want to work on

00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:21,319
them and they tend to not have a lot of

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:25,370
deadlines associated with that work it

00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:27,440
needs to be fun usually volunteers

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,880
already have a boring job next to it and

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,880
they don't want another boring job

00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:37,279
volunteer short form social ties based

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:41,410
on being on IRC being on mailing lists

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,410
going to conferences such as this

00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:49,040
employees on the other hand get assigned

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:52,250
work they get deadlines if they if they

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,170
go to a common office they share office

00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:58,339
space they often talk to their

00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:01,220
colleagues in the hallway it's a

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:05,689
discussion that's not written down but

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,459
that makes a lot of outsiders that makes

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:12,679
a lot of non employees if you like

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:16,809
outsiders in the process at the same

00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:20,290
time the deadline that the employee gets

00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:22,640
means he needs to get this thing done

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,169
and if he gets volunteers to help with

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,889
that thing at first you think oh great I

00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:32,419
have less work to do but the reality is

00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:36,389
often that you volunteered us stuff and

00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:41,970
for some reason he cannot do a certain

00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:44,429
piece and you have no way to go and be

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:48,749
annoyed and force this volunteer to do

00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:50,519
this for you so you often get developed

00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:54,450
you often get the paint developers

00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:56,340
talking to each other rather than

00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,739
talking with in with the volunteers

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,960
because the volunteers are annoying they

00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:03,299
want to be involved they want to do this

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,929
part but they don't work through the

00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:09,059
deadline you got as an employee and this

00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:13,529
is made worse by the fact that you have

00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:15,809
so many other ways to create ties to the

00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:17,549
people your work when you go to dinner

00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:23,789
with them you go to their birthdays you

00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:28,950
see them every day so let's go back

00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:32,940
briefly to how you pay people you want

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:37,049
to hire people how do you decide who

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:40,230
gets hired do you just pick the person

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:42,629
who contributes the most do you pick the

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:46,350
person who gets who contributes the best

00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:48,509
quality material do you pick the people

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,279
in India where you can hire five for the

00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:56,159
price that you'd pay for one person in

00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:58,859
Silicon Valley how do you motivate the

00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:01,559
volunteers that are not hired how do you

00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:05,190
keep from becoming a project or you hire

00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:08,100
so many people that you cannot get

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:11,340
volunteers anymore because if you hire

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,809
too many people people will join your

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,489
project with the intention of getting

00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:19,289
hired and if after treat to six months

00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,730
they have not yet gotten hired they

00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:24,019
assume they're not good enough and

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,019
they'll often leave

00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:33,040
so fine don't hire in long-term

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,900
contracts because it creates problems

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,270
will get a short-term contract we need

00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:44,320
to get a UI overhaul will hire somebody

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:46,670
for the UI overhaul the work gets done

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,310
but as an organization you have the

00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:52,060
problem that a month sorry that a year

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:55,160
from now when the work needs to be

00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:58,130
adopted because something changed the

00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,600
person who did the work is gone and you

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:05,180
have to hire somebody else to do it

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:07,990
again if you hire for specific jobs you

00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:12,760
can also create a culture where people

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:16,310
expect to be paid for specific work a

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,150
good example of this is that in many

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,960
open source communities

00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:26,750
internationalization is not something

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:29,330
that's paid for the company might be

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:32,770
paying for every other part of software

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,940
development except localization and

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:37,690
that's perfectly fine the people in

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,070
localization don't expect to be hired

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:49,790
but everybody else does expect to be

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:52,510
hired at some point the last category if

00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,320
you want to use the reward system

00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:58,010
because you don't want to hire people

00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,700
because of the results that have it's

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:04,510
good it's great for your community but

00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,400
you're still not going to get the speed

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,840
order a liability that you would get

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:15,110
from an employee because you're

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:18,290
rewarding people for the time spent rot

00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:20,180
rather than setting them in a contract

00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:22,330
where you have to do a certain amount of

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,330
work

00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:33,390
the final thing well the thing I want to

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:36,710
conclude with is that I have the

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:42,950
impression from the interviews I've done

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:46,710
that if your company is a company where

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:49,770
every engineer can influence the final

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,150
product you stand a good chance of being

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:54,120
able to work with a community of

00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:56,520
volunteers around your product if on the

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,490
other hand your company is one where

00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,110
decisions get made top down you're going

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:06,540
to run into a lot of problems with your

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:10,890
volunteers if you want to read up more

00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:12,810
on the science behind it behind this you

00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,880
can find a lot of papers on floss planet

00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:20,790
you can also find a lot of things on

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:25,980
google scholar my list of papers is also

00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:29,250
available online and when I finish up my

00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,860
research I'm supposed to write a fifty

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,080
to a hundred page small book from it if

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:38,040
you want that feel free to contact me by

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:42,500
email and i'll send you a copy in two to

00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,500
three months any questions

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,059
can you name some of the projects you've

00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:57,529
worked with in your research sort of

00:22:56,059 --> 00:23:00,710
what sort of projects were they or is

00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:05,720
that confidential and then the actual

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:08,480
projects are confidential hmm yeah but

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:12,950
I've worked with project which had a

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:18,610
large organization involved in that

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,610
community it was not always the only

00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:25,929
organization with money involved but it

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:28,789
was usually one really big sponsor and

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:31,760
that could have been but convert that

00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:40,840
could have been a commercial company or

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:40,840
a non-profit anybody else

00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:55,669
did you see a lot of difference between

00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:58,450
nonprofits and paid uh companies as far

00:23:55,669 --> 00:24:01,070
as like we're volunteers more willing to

00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:05,779
stay as volunteers alongside paid

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:07,460
nonprofits okay so I know I'm so the

00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:11,149
question is whether I saw a lot of

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:15,379
difference between for-profit companies

00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:20,839
and nonprofit organizations in this

00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:25,099
field I did not see a difference between

00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:27,469
the two or maybe a better way to say it

00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:29,719
is that the difference is that I've seen

00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:32,869
in published papers because I'm not the

00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:34,249
only one who's looked at this and in the

00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:37,609
communities that I've interviewed people

00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:40,129
from does not leave me to draw the

00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:42,919
conclusion that it's nonprofit or

00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:52,460
for-profit that that's the cause of the

00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:55,129
differences cool okay thanks that it

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,739
looks to me like some old site old style

00:24:55,129 --> 00:25:01,159
free software look for the commercial

00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:04,190
companies as I work for major gnu/linux

00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,739
vendor and everything is done upstream

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:09,529
all the decisions are done by the global

00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:12,080
maintainer of the free software and the

00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:13,999
company developers are really

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,429
contributors of the free software

00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:19,009
project so it is driven by the free

00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:22,399
software upstream so there are no

00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:23,809
decisions hidden in the company can you

00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:27,639
freeze it a little bit different because

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:27,639
I'm not entirely sure what you're asking

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:37,580
I'm not asking I was just commenting

00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:43,549
that I work for of friggin Olynyk

00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:47,289
slander and the decision are done in the

00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:50,899
upstream projects like the compilers gdb

00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:53,299
GCC and it is not driven from inside of

00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:55,669
the companies if the decision upstream

00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:57,510
is done some way the company cannot do

00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:59,610
anything with it so it's

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,220
not the decisions are not hidden in the

00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:04,820
company the company is really a

00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,850
contributor to the group yeah tricked

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:11,460
your talk the company you work for uses

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:13,860
the code of an of an open source project

00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,120
but it's not driving that project did I

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,490
get that current at this major

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,800
contributor but we can't change anything

00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:23,670
if Richard Stallman says something

00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,080
nobody can change it so that's a

00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,620
slightly different case than the

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:32,100
organization's i looked at indeed and

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:35,030
that will that will prevent some of the

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,380
issues i saw i think as long as that

00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:47,010
company does not become the dominant

00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:51,170
player in that projects ecosystem yes i

00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:54,860
want to know after the they paid

00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:59,070
motivation whether whether based

00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:02,430
motivation possible is it the new to you

00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:08,990
notoya t of the leader of the cult

00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:18,060
leader is it as the fan of the community

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:23,490
the travel or personal use of the of the

00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:29,250
program or work on a program for

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:31,500
nonprofit organization were the best you

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:35,370
want to know the motivations of people

00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,800
that are being paid so is a motivation

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:42,210
for the people who are not paid the ones

00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:44,640
who are not paid um some of that is the

00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:47,310
same as in open source communities where

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,950
you don't have companies involved namely

00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,810
it's fun doing it I'm learning

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,120
interesting things from it I know people

00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:57,300
on the project and I'm having they

00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,370
dragged me in and motivate me but what I

00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,750
noticed is that several of the people I

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:05,640
interviewed for a particular project

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:08,640
explicitly mentioned that they wanted to

00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,000
get hired they were contributing and

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,210
they were contributing a lot

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,549
but they really wanted to get hired and

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:20,010
they not all of them were sure that they

00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:30,330
would stay with the project if they did

00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:32,850
not get hired there is a lot of a lot

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,419
what you said here and a lot of the

00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:39,299
questions you post similar to what can

00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:42,750
be read on the wiki patterns I don't

00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:46,080
know if you know that there is a web

00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:49,289
page about introducing wiki's into your

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,149
core your I don't know I think I feel

00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:53,970
book I think there's a book about this

00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:56,669
as well yeah I what I wanted to ask is

00:28:53,970 --> 00:29:01,399
do you also look at the wiki communities

00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:04,470
because they seem to be much better

00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:06,570
result than than the open source

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,419
communities and they seem to have

00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:12,960
similar patterns of how they work I

00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:16,830
haven't looked at editing communities on

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:20,340
wikis there is a lot of research on them

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:23,490
being done but I not sure how much

00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:26,220
research is being done on them I by now

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,559
I know exactly how many well not exactly

00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,120
but I know pretty pretty well how many

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,250
papers have been written about open

00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:39,990
source communities but not about wiki

00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:42,480
community how many different communities

00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,669
did you study in this process and what

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,779
was the range in size of the community I

00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:50,429
studied one community in depth and I

00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:53,220
talked to people from two other

00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:56,010
communities to compare whether what I

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,140
saw in the in-depth interviews much to

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,240
what they experienced in their

00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:05,039
communities and how big were those

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,990
communities um just a rough ballpark I

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:11,159
mean like 10 people thousands of people

00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:13,740
know between 10 to 50 10 to 100

00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:17,090
developers I don't know exactly anymore

00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,090
I need to go look it up

00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:23,160
do you think there's a difference

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,200
between developing work and maybe more

00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,110
like see Salman world model is

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,960
moderation and all this kind of

00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:32,220
maintenance um I think you're talking

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,900
about two different things list

00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:38,910
moderation and sysadmin are I suspect

00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,970
two different categories of work one is

00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:44,990
the community management stuff which a

00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:48,150
lot of open source project seems seem to

00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,679
let fall by the wayside easily which is

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:55,290
also why several people mentioned pay

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:59,820
for this it's important Morris's admin

00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:01,800
stuff is it's less glorious two deuces

00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,660
up min and you have and you often have

00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,860
to do to twenty-four seven so I see that

00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:11,400
there can be more issues with it in that

00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:14,309
regards but I haven't studied the two

00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,160
separately so I can't say if it's really

00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:33,920
scientifically proven whether they're

00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:33,920
