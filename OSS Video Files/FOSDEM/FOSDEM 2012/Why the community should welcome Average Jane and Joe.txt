so I'm Clarissa I'm a member of the

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,389
Mozilla's community and I'm which I have

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,030
called an average Jana it would have

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,780
been it should have been mrs. nobody or

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:19,320
or mrs. Gendo something like that I've

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,369
chosen average n but you can choose the

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,960
world you want to define us

00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:28,080
so who are a ver Ã¤j--

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,949
Jane and Joe that could be us

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,969
for instance and quite look like this

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:38,820
these girls I don't care be sure that

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,430
according to me the world the expression

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,219
average Jane or Joe isn't pejorative at

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,460
all really because I'm an average Jane

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,530
as a contributor I claim I am an average

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,440
Jane in fact I think that it's my

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,020
personality as an average Jane that can

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,739
bring a lot of things to floss into the

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,940
Mozilla's community so to be an average

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,040
Jo Jo according to me it means that you

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,280
are not technical sometimes you don't

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,830
even know what floss is and if you have

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,450
some difficulties to make the sometimes

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,610
you have those some difficulties to make

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,710
the difference between floors and open

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,850
web for instance and I know it's just

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,850
awful to you but that's that's

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,979
like--that's in fact so what we don't

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,060
you don't do the difference so we are

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,720
not technical

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,939
we are not concept form but it doesn't

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,920
mean that we've nothing to bring to the

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,229
community and I hope to show you that we

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,439
have a lot of things to bring to the

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,770
community as average Jane or drew so I

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,070
hope to convince you about all we can

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,670
bring

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:51,860
as a virgin and Jo because I want you to

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:58,320
make some efforts to welcome us really I

00:01:51,860 --> 00:02:01,740
want you to think about what you can do

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,840
to welcome people like me too well

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,469
to welcome people that are no technical

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,099
no conceptual so I will tell you my

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:14,270
first steps in the community and I'm

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:17,580
warning you really

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:21,960
gigs are going to take it for their rank

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:26,690
so the only thing you need to listen to

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:30,330
this talk is sense of humor please

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,820
really don't forget I'm in love with a

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,430
gig it's been six years I'm still with

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,920
him so it's that something-something

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,680
I'll like the community finally I love

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,000
him I love Mozilla but I know he is a

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,820
geek and I know his defaults and I liked

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,459
them so just keep your sense of humor

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:54,930
and at the end if you want to talk with

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:57,270
me there's no problem I assume so my

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,100
first steps in the community in the

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,290
Mozilla's community in my case but it

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:07,310
would have been the same in the all the

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,310
communities in floss um this is my gig

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:19,340
he has strange passions you know the

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:25,290
first time I met her heard of gigs

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:27,150
it was quite astonishing really you know

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,670
when you are person that never have

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,120
thought about what's his operating

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:37,500
system for instance you really find them

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:41,100
very strange the first time you meet a

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:46,560
gig you can get surprised I mean they

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:48,900
have strange t-shirts and not only do

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:56,180
they have strange shots they are proud

00:03:48,900 --> 00:04:01,970
of it they have sometimes sinister look

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:06,200
and they are also proud of it

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,200
how they are strange attitudes

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:16,450
strange Obie's you know and I finally

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:25,630
discovered that it was often the result

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:29,740
of beers and they have incredible

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:33,820
matters of debate for people like me you

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,880
know they can pass take a lot something

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,820
like two hours of debating of what is

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,100
better between Ubuntu gen 2 Debian opens

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,080
his fedora red flags actually nukes LFS

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:49,360
global Linux Mint River 3 new Linux

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:52,540
sonic sauce ok can you imagine how you

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,970
feel when you don't even know what Linux

00:04:52,540 --> 00:05:01,780
is and that nobody takes care of

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:04,300
explaining you what Linux is because

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:10,420
they feel normal to talk about the

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:15,310
engine - extra extra so I have to admit

00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:18,670
that - first time I met some gigs I felt

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:23,350
lonely really and I was quite afraid of

00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:26,710
this universe but I finally discovered

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:30,960
that gigs are great and floss is just

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:34,000
splendid and I have found a translator

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,070
because I needed a translator that was

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,290
my boyfriend but unfortunately not only

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,870
my boyfriend because it is real a geek

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,240
and a big geek I found someone whose

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,730
name is Pascal Sorel and he was very

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,000
patient with me so it was my translator

00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:52,300
in this universe and thanks to him I

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,080
began to understand of course I didn't

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,810
understand everything but I managed to

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,660
perceive the Mozilla's philosophy the

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:08,380
floss philosophy and I realised that

00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:10,660
even if they are definitely strange the

00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,750
community the German they are doing in

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:20,199
fact something which is very full of

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:22,749
generosity and I finally admired them

00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,969
so I think the Earth's trend they are

00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,439
very very strange but now I understand

00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:28,749
that they are doing something for the

00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:32,830
the world something for a better

00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:34,569
internet in in Mozilla and so I really I

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,240
loved them for what they are doing and

00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:39,189
I'm proud of being with them and that's

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,310
why I decided to help them because I

00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:45,340
wanted to contribute and to participate

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,409
to this great philosophy and not only I

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:51,599
discovered what they are doing but I

00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:54,009
discovered what is the community and

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,169
that was very important to me because

00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:58,839
according to me the community is

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,060
something very incredible you mean I

00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:04,990
mean you can live in France and receive

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:08,919
some help from South Africa Canada China

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,629
etc and we all share a philosophy we

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:12,639
share the will of getting an upper web

00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:16,689
and share ideas to promote flows and

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:20,080
that's best that's most important to me

00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:23,050
than technical things you know I know

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:28,199
that if I can't share technical opinions

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:30,849
I can't share some some masters of

00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,580
technical things I can share this

00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:37,569
philosophy and I can understand what

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,729
they are doing and helping them so what

00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:42,159
is very astonishing is that thanks to

00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:46,029
the community I even managed to be more

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:48,250
technical a little for instance I had a

00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:51,930
real revelation when I discovered the

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:54,729
difference between Java and JavaScript

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,860
because for a non-technical person like

00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:02,080
me Java JavaScript ok it's an extension

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:05,979
and not at all I even received a manage

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,439
a marriage proposal the day I advised a

00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:13,539
kinesiologist to a man who wanted to

00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:15,580
learn Emacs so now the Mozilla and floss

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:18,490
is definitely a great part of my life

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,919
but I'm still and I want to stay an

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,520
average Jane and I'm sure I'm quite

00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:27,729
useful to floss as an average Jane

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,889
because gigs have a dependency the

00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:33,610
general public

00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:36,430
the community is closely tied is closely

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:42,640
knit but it's a quite small community

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:48,570
and it needs to grow more and more but

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:51,640
you can't grow if you stay between gigs

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,860
you can't open you to the rest of the

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:59,200
world if you stay in between gigs and if

00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:01,060
you only accept gigs so I think that the

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,269
general public should more enter the

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:08,860
community the problem is that gigs lives

00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:12,339
live in isolation they often have the

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,200
impression that they are right the

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:19,000
impression that they are in position of

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,550
the truth that's what I feel and offer

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,709
wrong they often think everybody

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,470
understand what they say and what they

00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,269
do

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:32,500
alright if you do think so I can tell

00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:34,420
you you're wrong from my point of view

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,480
you say and do a lot of ink run

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,519
preassembled things rarely the

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,980
consequence is that sometimes gigs

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,790
create sites or software that only they

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:48,130
are able to use or control so how do you

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:52,440
want to see the floss invade the world

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:56,589
if only a few people can understand I

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,649
let you read this I found it very very

00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:12,630
representative of what I fell and of

00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:12,630
what gigs Sims seemed to do RTFM

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:24,940
great very easy you don't often take

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:27,010
care of the general public I mean so

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,540
geeks need average in order to

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,750
understand what the public really wants

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,880
our need really and you can also take

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,490
advantage of average Jane or Drew in

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,210
your communities they'll become the link

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:43,540
between you and the public for instance

00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,460
with Mozilla we went to Senegal to

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:49,810
participate to the creation of the

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:52,810
Mozilla community in Senegal and I was

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:56,140
part of the try the trip because they

00:10:52,810 --> 00:11:01,450
wanted me to present what was Mozilla

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:03,490
and it was they chose me because they

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,339
thought that I was able to speak to

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:11,950
speak with simple words and simple ideas

00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:15,760
and it worked really because I first in

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:19,089
fact we began our trip by giving a large

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,660
conference saying what Mozilla is and I

00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:26,010
was doing it and then technical person

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:29,020
could go to see our technicians

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:33,100
professional of b2g of mobile extracts

00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:36,310
Terra and I was here to ensure the link

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,040
between those people and really it

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:43,440
worked it worked because I was able to

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,420
speak to everybody with simple words so

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,750
that's something I hope you realized

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,940
that a virgin and Joe can help you to

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,950
reach the general public and through

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,040
understand the needs of the general

00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:00,550
public too

00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:05,410
so now how can you welcome average Jane

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:08,589
and Joe the first step is to welcome

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,450
them and to open some events to them the

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:14,760
next step is to make some efforts to

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:17,470
speak to them normally with simple words

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,790
the final step is to propose them some

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,980
contributions they could do more easily

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:27,730
so first please

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:30,070
try to be sociable and friendly I mean

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:34,120
um if you want to welcome know more

00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:38,519
people you have to be welcoming so you

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,519
have to leave your computer for a while

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,070
you know when I come to floss events

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:53,649
I've noticed that most of you are coding

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:55,870
even at the stands so try to realize we

00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,610
are general public we have some

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,589
difficult skills to understand where we

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,510
are and what we are doing here because

00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:05,339
there are a lot of strange things

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:10,149
strange words Linux Mozilla open shoes

00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:18,339
strange stands and the only thing we we

00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:23,639
see is people that's all so please raise

00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:25,990
your head and smile first thing to do

00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,470
you have to take care of the public if

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,149
you want to welcome the public so leave

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,350
your computer when you are understand

00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:37,740
well instead go go ahead and let people

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:42,279
who is able to talk to the public

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,430
staying at the stand um the other thing

00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:48,040
is that I'm sorry for you but you have

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:52,149
to be prepared to answer to a lot of

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:57,399
silly questions it's true such as how do

00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:59,980
you make money in floss yeah

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,199
general public wants to know they don't

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,370
understand how you do

00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:11,220
why do you contribute without being paid

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:11,220
or why doesn't make computer work

00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:20,700
okay you'll have to make some sacrifices

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:23,940
it's true but I know it's just boring to

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,460
you to be the outliner and I know it's

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,290
awful to you and I understand but if you

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,840
want to reach the attention of the

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:35,790
general public you'll have to make some

00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:44,730
efforts very important - don't be too

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:48,900
technical please don't enter in the

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:52,500
details and accept the fact that normal

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:56,120
people don't master technical terms even

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,470
the most simple for instance

00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,810
realize that most don't make the

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:05,130
difference between browser and search

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:08,370
Ongina so what we don't make the

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:11,250
difference I received a lot of attack

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:16,440
because I was saying Oh Mozilla yeah

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:19,260
it's a search on China okay what does it

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,930
matter what is the problem the problem

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:25,820
is to me is to understand the flaws

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:30,180
philosophy and then okay I'll give some

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:34,200
false information but it's my first

00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:36,150
steps so it's no more take the time

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,160
please to explain the most important

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,550
several tears but not all the scible

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,970
tears

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:45,420
don't be focused on details average N

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,950
and Jo are not stupid well some of them

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:55,070
are but they just don't know your world

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:55,070
so be patient be pedagogical and please

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:03,600
forget the expression RTFM entire year

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:07,560
no way never never

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:11,280
RTFM on the contrary take advantage of

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,800
is user experience ask general public

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,460
what are is needs and you'll learn some

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,560
things I have a suggestion if you're not

00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,380
ready to make all these sacrifices I'm

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,630
sure you can find in your community at

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,970
least one person with real

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:31,260
to talk to normal people and to answer

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:33,900
those all four questions so I've noticed

00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,960
that new members are often ready to face

00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,930
mr. and mrs. nobody because they are

00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,090
often more enthusiastic not completely

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,230
immersed in flossed and so they can use

00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:48,900
you can use this energy and send them

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:53,250
send you new members to events schools

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:55,470
put them on the stands extra in fact try

00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,680
to find in your communities a mr.

00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:01,200
average friendly only one it's a good

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,940
point for instance in mozilla we have a

00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,120
young boy whose name is small he

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:09,060
participated to our free hugs this these

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,810
things and really it was just

00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:15,870
astonishing he went to speak to all

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:19,050
people even to policemen to speak about

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,939
Mozilla and he wasn't afraid by the

00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:24,089
ignorance of the general public at all

00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:26,640
it was just incredible really and we did

00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:29,070
a lot with we found a lot of

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,310
contributors as this day or a lot of

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:35,790
users because it was so friendly so

00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:37,800
generous that really people went to see

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,110
us too to understand what mozilla was

00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:46,320
extra extra and that was a real good day

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:48,630
for us so here is how you connect to

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,420
welcome average a ninja but now since

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:56,310
you can't be too technical what can you

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:58,170
say to normal people i've tried to think

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,190
about what attracted me and what

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:04,140
attracted my friends and well you won't

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:07,500
be you won't agree with everything i

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,860
know it but here are some things you can

00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:14,730
talk about to normal people the first

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:17,700
thing in flows no price no tax no fees I

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:21,680
know that floss doesn't mean that it's

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:25,620
greatest I know it but the fact is that

00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,570
though the most of the time it's gratis

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:32,220
and that's something that the general

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:34,140
public loves and can understand so

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,980
that's a point a good point to attract

00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:42,840
someone the other point

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:44,789
for instance you can speak about VLC or

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,889
something like that that's a good point

00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:48,929
to attract people you know saying oh you

00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:52,470
have your seat scratches it's good extra

00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:55,830
extra um the other thing of course is

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,960
Flo's philosophy I tried to summary the

00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:01,440
flaws philosophy according to people

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:06,630
like me you know was the metaphor of the

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,620
folly Burgess was the cake do you love

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,970
for Internet

00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:15,269
beers of course and people people

00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,220
together if we can't understand what is

00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:19,350
technical we can understand the values

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,179
and those values are very very

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,340
attractive for the general public

00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,139
I'm sure of it you can speak about the

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,539
folly but is the way we would like to

00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:31,460
change the world contributing two floors

00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:33,809
extra extra for instance to my friend I

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,870
explained that Firefox on the contrary

00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:42,240
of ie or Chrome is a browser with a soul

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:45,389
with values and it works and the other

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,720
thing you can talk about is community of

00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:50,639
course community because unser you've

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,580
proved to average a non Jew that you're

00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:55,590
not only a beer a geek but also a

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,539
sensitive person

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,389
I'm sure they would like to better know

00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:02,429
the community so they'll be very happy

00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:05,669
to discover this world of sharing of

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:12,480
muted throughout the world like we did

00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:14,909
in Senegal so now the contributions you

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,549
can propose to average an and Joe there

00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:22,080
are a lot really I'm sure you can find

00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:25,740
some the first one is organization

public relations extracts Torah the the

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,740
link that can be the link between you

00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,510
and the general public and that's

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:35,010
something very advanced it's a big

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:37,590
advantage to you so please find your

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:47,250
they'll be perfect to you they can

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:51,270
organize also events of course they can

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:56,520
do localization it's Dino the mask

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:58,320
of French Mozilla so they can

00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,680
participate to localization we have a

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,630
very good team in France of localization

00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,470
and they are really meeting and

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:10,620
welcoming some people to to localize and

Mozilla but you have some I think some

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,240
support in all communities and that's

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,370
also something you can propose to mr.

able to put simple words to explain a

00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,720
lot of things about flows so that's also

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,650

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,610
average n I'm able to put simple words

00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,930
to and to create a portrait of people

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,760
something very sensitive not only

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:15,150
thing another general draw can also blog

yeah of course always with simple words

00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:22,710

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:27,720
other people and I'm and so and so on so

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:29,370

the translator for questions because I

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,410
have some difficulties with English so

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,700
Delphine is gonna help me because I

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:41,720
often don't understand questions in

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,720
English and sorry so yes

00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:00,220
in ideas across the people it's

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,100
preconceptions that people have about

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:08,040
open source and and the community at

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:11,950
large in that there is no quality or

00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:13,870
that they can only keep the status quo

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,120
in other words certain proprietary

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,580
operating systems shall we say and stuff

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,640
like that and especially when presenting

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:24,940
to schools it's it's always the

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,540
psychology is always the preconceptions

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:32,170
and I think what what's your feelings on

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:37,690
that is it we can we can be as open as

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:43,750
we can as we can but it's difficult to

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:47,640
speak to people yeah of course so you're

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:50,140
saying that it's odd to to break

00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,600
misconceptions about about flaws that's

00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:58,030
it

00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:03,790
it's possible but you have to you have

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:07,480
to be aware of the appearance of gigs

00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:11,700
which isn't wrong appearances I mean I

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:15,580
love gigs really I love them now but

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:18,460
sometimes to break misconceptions you

00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,920
have to be prepared in fact you really

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:24,820
have to I don't know take a text obscene

00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:26,620
and write ideas to get prepared if you

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,870
face someone who have misconceptions

00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,780
that's the first thing that's something

00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:35,350
we could do you know I mean I'd like to

00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:38,890
to do a list of misconceptions in floss

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,990
and then helping cakes to answer to

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,960
these misconceptions that would be a

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:47,680
good point and some things something you

00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,000
can you could use maybe and about

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,700
misconceptions there are misconceptions

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,429
everywhere I mean I I'm a FEMINIST and I

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,429
know misconceptions about women also and

00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:02,149
the defect is that you begin to open you

00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:04,880
to the rest of the world

00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:09,620
I find this year that wisdom was more

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:13,299
open than the the president here because

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:18,500
it's it's evolving really I'm sure of it

00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:21,889
and you and the only thing you need to

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,919
break misconceptions is um ro you Mar

00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:27,169
not don't be too technical very

00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:32,870
important really very important because

00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:35,139
you you'll you'll lose your your

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:39,080
interlocutor if you're too technical and

00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:41,809
and stay on the philosophy always the

00:25:39,080 --> 00:26:15,500
philosophy be simple and that's you I'm

00:25:41,809 --> 00:26:19,509
sure you it would it would work very

00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,490
good and useful idea to society and

00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:23,990
that's it really I mean that that's the

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,450
biggest difficulty that I've had is oh

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:34,460
is never the technicalities it's never

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:38,539
even me putting on a suit and being Joe

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:42,789
businessman it's always getting over the

00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:45,789
preconceptions anyway I've talked enough

00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:49,690
you'll face a problem if you want to

00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:52,909
welcome general public is that the world

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:57,230
community often appears like a sect you

00:26:52,909 --> 00:27:02,080
know my father is it sure that I've

00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:04,820
entered the sect it sure of it

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,019
fortunately image I met my geek and he

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,340
loves him okay

00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:10,490
but the the world community is of an

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,770
very

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,230
Trane's to him and when you see this is

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:21,200
a lot of people wearing the same shirts

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:23,360
is very very afraid to follow on to that

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,970
point I am I think we're actually at a

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,040
very interesting time because with you

00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,870
know with the political situation around

00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,660
the world as it is I think a lot of

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,650
people are becoming aware of the

00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,630
importance of their their privacy and

00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,059
their data if you read some of the

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:40,550
studies that have come out you know the

00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:41,720
the media myth is that people don't care

00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,150
about their privacy and they're happy to

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,760
give away their data to Google+ or to

00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,590
Facebook or to one of those be moths but

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,320
but in reality that you know that's not

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,000
supported by the data and so I think

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,920
that that's probably an excellent

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,470
talking point you know to get people

00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,390
into the philosophy of it you know I I

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,520
certainly don't know anybody who likes

00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,410
using Facebook people use it because

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,420
it's it's all that there is and they

00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,670
certainly don't think it's a it's a good

00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,679
thing and I think there is an increasing

00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:11,960
awareness of the of what you're giving

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,250
up to be to be on that platform and I

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,260
think that's that's that could be one

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:19,690
way that we could we could help people

00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,690
to see that floss is the way forward

00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:38,710
we were checking it together because I'm

00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:43,090
so afraid of don't understand something

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:51,070
so I prefer I have something that might

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:54,190
lead to a question we all here are very

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:57,520
much convinced of our high principles

00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:59,919
ideals we want good stuff but I think

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,080
perhaps sometimes when pop talking to

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,549
the general public we are focusing too

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,240
much on the high ideals

00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:09,640
shouldn't we a much lower at the the

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,970
much more banal things what's in it for

00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:19,690
me what's in it for you I don't see

00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:23,200
people demonstrating outside for open

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:26,289
source or open standards but they might

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,230
do it for take your hands off my mp3's

00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:34,559
or well there must be better as examples

00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,559
I just don't know what are your thoughts

00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:51,640
yeah I do agree with you really I do

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,370
think that sometimes we may be too much

00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,620
in the philosophy and the ideas of

00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,480
standards extracts the raw and that's to

00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,260
our for the general public that's true

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,510
that's why I've talked about prices and

00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:09,700
the gratis extracts that because and so

00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:11,950
and so because it's an easy point to

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:15,460
catch the entire the attention and even

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:19,960
if it's done it's not totally true about

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:23,770
flaws it's something that people always

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:28,360
strong yeah so you have this and then

00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:31,559
you have just to to show some software's

00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,570
that are very useful to general public

00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:38,350
you can speak about VLC for instance

00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:40,809
it's a easy way to to show something

00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:44,890
that the general public often doesn't

00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:45,280
know and to say you know it's not only

00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,360
does it

00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:52,510
walk but it's free it's and then you can

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,660
explain what it means but the first

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:59,140
thing is to put in live some attractive

00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:01,120
things for normal people like the price

00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,560
like the fact that there are very

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:12,640
efficient softwares

00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:16,960
extra extra it's free the next question

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:19,800
is if it's free is it safe I have to

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,420
download it it's all it's immediately

00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,690
distrusted there could be anything in it

00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,850
who made it I don't know yeah company

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,790
name but for instance you can speak

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:34,000
about Linux and saying you'll have no

00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:36,540
various with Linux with point two for

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,540
the general public

00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:47,890
I actually often have to face people who

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:52,090
don't even know what they are using like

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:54,040
what actually is a web browser they they

00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:57,010
don't even know that to go on the

00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,530
internet they need a program they they

00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:03,460
don't know what an operating system is

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:05,710
how do I explain to those to those

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:10,180
people that they actually have a choice

00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:12,910
okay umm it's true we don't even as an

00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:16,420
average a know Joe we don't know of what

00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:19,570
is a web brother or such a giant extra

00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:22,210
but the what I wanted to show you

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:25,960
through this talk is that of of course

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:28,930
you won't be able to welcome all the

00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,540
general public but you can find some

00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,460
average Jane and Joe that eyeball to

00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,280
understand the philosophy that are able

00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:39,010
to enter the community and then you'll

00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:43,380
be able to use this over Jane and Joe to

00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:46,090
create a link between you as gigs as

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:49,450
developers extra and the rest of the

00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:53,080
world but for that you have to welcome

00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:56,820
some normal people more open in their

00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:59,789
mind in a way but not

00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:05,370
no technical no conceptual people you

00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:10,230
know it's just to find new kind of

00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:13,320
people in your communities okay so kind

00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:15,240
of people like myself I'm I'm not

00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,850
technical at all actually that's my

00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,360
first open source event that's it mmm

00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:25,889
but I want to I like this need in the in

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:28,769
the floss from now and and then we'll be

00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:30,929
able you me and other people and

00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:34,019
non-technical people will be able to

00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:37,379
create the link and admit it will be it

00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:40,350
will be slowly of course not not easy to

00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:44,039
do and also the things you have to do is

00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:50,789
to convince your family of course there

00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:55,289
are importance that's quite hard with

00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:57,149
the preconceptions and the trying to

00:33:55,289 --> 00:34:00,299
convince people the hardest thing I find

00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:05,309
is if it's so good why you're giving it

00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:06,960
away for free that that's the big

00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:09,089
difficult question how do you answer

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,099
that why is it free if it's so good you

00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:13,099
get what you pay for right yeah

00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:26,960
okay I should add this question in my

00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:29,019
list if it ended because it's enough for

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,859
questions

00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:38,659
the onion so you can have is that it's

00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:44,329
good because it's free and it's a

00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:46,789
question of values you have strong

00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:49,129
values and so you want to make strong

00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:52,009
software's but free software's because

00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:54,589
of your values and you don't have money

00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:57,819
people for instance I've noticed that

00:34:54,589 --> 00:35:01,009
when I'm giving talks about Mozilla

00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:05,630
people really love when I'm saying that

00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:10,099
that the budget of Mozilla is the

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:13,670
equivalent of the budget of food in

00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:16,160
Google yeah you know the old budget of

00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,799
Mozilla represents the budget of food in

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,190
Google and people love that because they

00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:27,109
say wow you're you're doing an

00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:31,039
incredible things with so few money and

00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:33,619
and they're very happy because anyway

00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,200
you can take profits of this time you

00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:42,079
know what's the crisis it's a it's a

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:45,710
moment when people is going they don't

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:50,440
want more capitalistic even if I don't

00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:54,289
like politic but I felt that people

00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:57,769
needs values at this time because of the

00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:59,539
crisis and it's a good moment to talk

00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:02,210
about flaws and to talk about those

00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:04,190
values because they are fed up was money

00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,559
they are fed up was all those things

00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:09,170
with banks extra extra and you're saying

00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:21,109
okay I'm bringing you something which is

00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:23,509
very efficient and free we should be

00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:25,880
talking more about the philosophy but

00:36:23,509 --> 00:36:27,769
when I explained that the freedom that

00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,239
you get is to be able to modify programs

00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,619
they say but I don't care I'm never

00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:32,119
going to touch a program

00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:33,619
then I explained okay but think about

00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,930
your house if your house would have been

00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:38,180
really completely closed you will always

00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:40,369
have to call the same plumber to change

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,769
to fix your toilet but it because

00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,900
somehow open you can call different

00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:47,390
plumbers let me say okay so I can always

00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,910
ask somebody else to fix it but then you

00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:52,579
said that we should welcome average Jane

00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:54,319
and Jean to do contribution but what do

00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:56,720
you think are low-hanging fruits for

00:36:54,319 --> 00:37:03,829
average people to contribute to our

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:06,650
community what are the easy things that

00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:10,279
we can ask average people to contribute

00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:11,809
into the community rally to to do

00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:15,049
organization to participate to the

00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:17,299
organization to be in in some way the

00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:20,269
cheerleader because gigs are very hard

00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:21,920
to you you're not organization the most

00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:23,359
of the time and I and you're just

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,359
forgetting a lot of things because

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,400
you're coding and there's the rest of

00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:31,549
those things are just not important you

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:36,859
know I live with a gig so I it's just

00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:38,299
hard sometimes and so you can take

00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:41,569
profit as this and they will be very

00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:43,700
happy to be the cheerleader of the

00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:46,519
movement and of the event something like

00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,279
that the localization is really also a

00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:53,109
good point because they can by this way

00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:56,930
discover what exists in the inflows and

00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:59,720
translating translating this in in their

00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:03,349
own language it's something very easy

00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,450
and very very good to understand some

00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:08,509
things and to truly learn some things

00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:11,079
also that's what I'm why and what I'm

00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:14,890
doing with Tunisian people for instance

00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:17,390
telling them that they can translate

00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:21,039
documents they need but they are in

00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:25,249
English and so they are translating in

00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:27,319
Arab and and in French too and then by

00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:29,420
this way they are learning the the

00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:31,579
philosophy they are learning some

00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:35,259
technical things and it's a good point -

00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:35,259
okay thanks

00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:45,910
I just have a command on the last

00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:49,000
question what can the average user do

00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:51,640
for the for the community and yesterday

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,280
there's been a similar talk by Alison

00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,160
Randall I think and she told us and I

00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,590
agree with her that the average user can

00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,810
help improving manuals we we attack ease

00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,610
attempt to write menus that are

00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:07,390
completely incomprehensible for the

00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:09,760
average user so we need a link to the

00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:12,040
general public there so everybody can

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,470
help improving manuals everybody can

00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,540
help doing support like support forums

00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:19,390
pick up a question one question a week

00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:22,810
and just answer that one question and as

00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:33,610
it's a huge help for for the community

00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:36,460
and everybody at this time okay you

00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:38,890
could do you could say read the

00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:42,520
manual but not always

00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:46,090
please you know it's when I'm on I are

00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:48,720
see I often ask some questions and just

00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:52,570
to understand some some things and and

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:57,670
what I receive is the link on the

00:39:52,570 --> 00:40:01,150
Wikipedia page I hate this really I hate

00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:04,630
it really it's just you know it's very

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:07,320
boring for people like me other

00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,320
questions okay

00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:25,260
is there anything in particular the

00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:28,170
documents you can do to attract the

00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:30,630
average Jane rather than the average Joe

00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:39,619
I'm not saying we should not saying we

00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:42,300
should necessarily but yeah just just to

00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:43,830
you know there are there is a lot of

00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:47,670
there are a lot of ideas about

00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:50,760
attracting women community for a variety

00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:53,700
of reasons and but there aren't a lot of

00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,310
ideas about attracting women users of

00:40:53,700 --> 00:41:07,250
free software so what do you think about

00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:12,450
that average Jane okay averaging okay

00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:16,350
for a vagina the first thing is to the

00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:21,030
advice I can give you is when a when a

00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:24,060
friend of yours find a girlfriend tell

00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:27,960
them tell them to convince his

00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:31,410
girlfriend to bring your friends the

00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:34,109
first thing thanks to me

00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:40,650
geeks of Mozilla I've met a lot of a lot

00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:43,140
of girls okay they didn't manage to to

00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:51,840
get in love with them but then they met

00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:54,960
them was a good you know I deeply think

00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:57,510
that as geeks you're just lovely and I'm

00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,260
very passionate about that but if you

00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:04,190
stay always behind your computer you

00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,190
won't find love

00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:12,390
right I meant that more in a sense of

00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:22,760
just attracting female users not in the

00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:29,430
sense of yeah picking up girls yeah

00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:32,160
really yeah I should saying that you

00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:34,290
have to convince more women to get to be

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,810
speakers in your hand that would be a

00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:41,340
good point too because we need to get

00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:53,520
represented as women so more women geeks

00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:55,590
more women users yeah thank you oh just

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,510
to say that some of the best software

00:42:55,590 --> 00:43:00,960
engineers I have ever come across have

00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:04,490
been women yeah a hundred percent more

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,440
no seriously because they tend to get

00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:10,530
head down and doing things and

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,930
understanding things that a different

00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:17,790
way of thinking and it's so sad that

00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:20,490
because for instance the focus in

00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:23,210
schools now is on using applications

00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:28,610
rather than teaching kids how to code

00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:32,220
there are less women coming forward to a

00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:36,930
career and something that could do which

00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:37,800
they can kick men's butts just as much

00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,830
as anything else

00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,590
and it's really sad and it's it's it's a

00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:47,670
misconception that it isn't something

00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:51,060
that it is too geeky and I think I think

00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:53,970
it is really sad and I think if opening

00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:56,280
up to non geeks as you so if we can take

00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:01,650
that to the schools we will have more

00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:04,590
women here at for STEM also we know you

00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:07,400
know we are member will most women in

00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:10,290
Mozilla it's an association in um in

00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,740
Mozilla and we are trying to think about

00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:18,180
it and to to think about the ways we

00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:21,600
could make more girls enter the computer

00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:24,560
Sciences but it's the beginning and it

00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:28,010
would be hard of course

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,010
other questions

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,980
well this is my email if you want to

00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:41,040
talk about and this is my whoop-ass

00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:44,990
hammer just for the macho men but let's

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:48,170
keep quiet I'm not so awful

00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:48,170
