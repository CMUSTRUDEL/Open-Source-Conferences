follow me on twitter

00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,660
at speed Copa so

00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:20,380
of all I am very happy to speak for an

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:23,079
international audience because yeah this

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,750
day is quite international because if I

00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:30,579
would go to Italia I don't know a lot of

00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,899
about Italy I am I would have to find my

00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:35,200
way through the public transportation

00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:37,870
system and so if I would want to take

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,520
train and I wouldn't know where to find

00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,050
the right information because probably

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,780
in the station's everything will be an

00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:47,500
Italian and I don't know I don't know

00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:50,710
any Italian sorry so i will probably

00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,510
look on my smartphone but which website

00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,579
should i check what is the company that

00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,540
that makes takes care of this

00:00:54,579 --> 00:01:01,540
information I don't have a clue so what

00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,760
do i do I take my smartphone I go to my

00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,460
normal application and I try to find the

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,140
right information but there is no such

00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,060
thing and Europe at this moment which

00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,969
gives all my information in one place

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,469
and there is no such thing as an

00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:18,819
application that combines all the

00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:22,990
different all the different companies in

00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:25,600
one app so who are we we are just a

00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,789
bunch of people where people with

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,100
commercial interests or people who just

00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:33,009
want to do this for fun just like a

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,469
normal open source community who wants

00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:38,439
to take care of this problem and at this

00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:42,490
moment we take care of the enemy s which

00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:45,429
is the Belgian rail company so we take

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:51,039
care of public lands transport data for

00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:54,659
developers yeah so anyone can use our

00:01:51,039 --> 00:02:01,829
data which which is on a server on by

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,829
API so we had some problems recently

00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:09,450
and sep tember we were we were doing all

00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:12,960
this this stuff and in July sorry or in

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:15,810
June in we got this letter which said we

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:22,500
had to stop immediately with what we

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:25,200
were doing yeah but kind of arguments

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,500
that that we didn't agree with so there

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,860
was a an attorney even from the London I

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:37,970
don't think maybe he's here over there

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:42,300

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:45,030
and yeah thanks to him we're still up

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,900
and running and of course young thanks

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,160
to pass off and quicken burner which is

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:56,190
a minister here in our in our country

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,040
who sent a tweet to put RL back online

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,790
and we got a huge large dot effect and

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:06,030
all that stuff so we are still up and

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,010
running and this is yeah this circle

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:12,120
interface is what we do at this moment

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:15,870
and what we have done for 42 years long

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,080
and this is just a screenshot of our

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:23,100
elder PE which you can find all the

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,200
schedules for for the trains in Belgium

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,350
only the trains at this moment but we

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,459
are planning on making this bigger so

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:37,950
this website connects through an API

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:41,040
which is this nice xml interface and you

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:45,360
can see various data which we don't show

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,209
oh and ND the ND web interface but of

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,940
course there are other interfaces such

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,130
as or apps and such as widgets or you

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,860
can implement something yourself or you

00:03:53,130 --> 00:04:00,600
can use this on your website to show how

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,540
how your office deals with transport

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,880
thought and stuff so yeah I won't feed

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,709
the trolls we also have Jason so for

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,340
people who don't like Excel

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:15,200
we have four requests in our API that's

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,560
stations that's all the list of all the

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,160
stops of a certain public transport

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,620
company for four trains Azure of

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,889
obviously all the stations for buses

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,500
this is all the bus stops and so on we

00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:33,020
also have connections this is to plan a

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,630
trip from to a certain place we have

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,610
live port live ports are stuff that you

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,250
will see when you enter a station or a

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,550
bus stop we will see all the the time

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:49,310
schedules for the next few trains that

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:51,130
will leave or depart leave or arrive and

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:55,550
we have information about one specific

00:04:51,130 --> 00:05:00,020
vehicle so you don't have to implement

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,849
this API yourself you can of course we

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,400
have written a lot of codes or so

00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:07,789
already you can reuse that all the code

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,930
rewrite is a GPL version three license

00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:14,870
or names maybe some apps are under MIT

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,740
but that's the authors authors choice of

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:23,500
course for the lazy people who didn't go

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,500
to project our elbow BES scan it

00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:31,880
you got it right oh yeah

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,069
right

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,949
so for the people who want to do a

00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:44,469
project to this data we started an NPO

00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:46,960
that's a nonprofit organization and we

00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:49,629
can reaches in several ways you can use

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,529
IRC for the die-hard hackers who also

00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:57,669
who always use IRC such as I and you

00:05:53,529 --> 00:06:02,020
probably there was a medalist there is a

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:05,110
track so if you have a problem file a

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:09,300

we will also take into account the

00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,230
things we learned from api version 1.0

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,690
which are quite a lot of tickets which

00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,420

I hope you enjoyed this and I hope some

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,890
people will come afterwards to me to ask

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,200
whether their country can be supported

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,260
or certain type of transport can be

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,850
supported so there are any questions I

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,290
would like to take them i think i have

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,290
still five minutes left

00:09:51,020 --> 00:10:04,110
for a me go or um could you repeat

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:08,250
question yes the question was can we use

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:11,340
this form name of five or for the older

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:18,030
versions i'm looking to my app developer

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:20,730
and he says no only 45 yes scheduled

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:24,150
right will we be able to download the

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:27,180
schedule data hello for some companies

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:30,300
this is this is a major issue because

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,330
they don't like to share that data in an

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,400
open way and and afterwards so that

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,440
other people can can reuse that and

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,110
maybe they will work with an older done

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,790
so it data that's not really up to date

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:47,690
so transport companies asked us to to do

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,400
not offer the algorithms but for some

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,550
companies we will eventually do that if

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,240
they allow us to do so

00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,240
yes

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,370
interesting things of winter

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:04,390
can you speak up please

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,390
interesting thing

00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,709
sorry I didn't get that

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,650
providers use

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,350
sorry I really didn't get that you come

00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,440
across techniques that the providers

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:27,800
used to stop me from screen scraping no

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,620
you haven't so the question was do

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:35,270
providers try to to stop us and the

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,130
answer is yes why we had this disease

00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:40,100
and desist letter but from technical

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:44,090
points we have never received any

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,100
obstruction like that so we can wrote a

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:49,880
round that with trying other eye peas

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:53,630
and stuff if they would do that but at

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:57,170
this moment we man we don't like to be

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,570
seen as an illegal project we are we are

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,490
really just some awesome people who try

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:05,510
to be awesome for everyone even the

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,990
transport companies yes what is the

00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,990
license

00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:16,080
yes that's a very good question what's

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,960
the license of the data that we already

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,660
have well at this moment we only have

00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,940
the data of the Belgian train company

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,030
but the belton bus company the Flemish

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:33,330
bus company as we are talking with and

00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:38,160
we are talking with the Brussels best

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:41,940
company but the the dot of the the

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,330
Belgian railway company is really normal

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,640
and our point of view it's free to use

00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:53,130
you can use that without any any license

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:56,580
since there's I'm sure even who is very

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:58,680
close to you will give a very yeah of

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:03,440
the right yeah front of you will give a

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:06,960
very very broad and broad answer to that

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,560
but we generally say with there are no

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,690
copyrights on the on the data because of

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,640
the second database law you can look

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,720
that up a few if you want or ask even

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,550
about

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,730
