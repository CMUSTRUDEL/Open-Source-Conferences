you

00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,400
hello everybody I'm Anka from the

00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,900
quickie project and in the next 15

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,200
minutes we're going to see how we

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,940
implemented annotations on documents the

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,940
extensible wiki way and you'll soon

00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,240
understand what that means so a bit

00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:28,039
about tix wiki wiki is an enterprise

00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,720
application wiki written in Java it's

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,470
been there for six years I've been a

00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,740
committer for almost three years now

00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:38,810
that's from 2010 23 committers 12

00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,879
commits per day for issues fixed per day

00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,489
which is quite good now what's

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,070
enterprise app application wiki what's a

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:47,719
application wiki most important well

00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,930
first it means that it's a wiki it has

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,860
the documents it has enterprise level

00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,410
collaboration features around these

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,719
documents and besides that it has

00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,359
accessibility features to allow users to

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,850
create situational applications meaning

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,590
that users would normal users with go in

00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:08,000
the web interface of the wiki they will

00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:11,120
define data types and and they will fill

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,830
in data for those data types store it in

00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,540
the wiki and then write a little bit of

00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,200
scripting to use that data to create

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,400
little applications and we have actually

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,270
I have actually done that you're going

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,070
to see how it works in the demo now

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,860
about these annotations the first time i

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,990
use the annotations seriously was when i

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,369
was preparing my bachelor science thesis

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,380
and i was creating these pdfs sending

00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:38,229
them to my supervisor my supervisor was

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,490
filling them with the yellow stuff

00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:43,369
hopefully after a couple of months i

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:46,610
managed to get a non yellow paper to

00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,710
actually do the thesis and so he was

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,509
giving me various suggestions don't

00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,030
rephrase that don't write it like this

00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:55,790
and so on and so on so we're exchanging

00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,380
these documents between me and him now

00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,000
imagine that I have a colleague I want

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,969
to write the paper with and some other

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,909
but Professor I want to to annotate to

00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:06,860
review my paper and you can see that's

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,630
already a bit too much communication and

00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,520
if we add some more people and some more

00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,470
people it becomes a whole big pile of

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,420
mess we don't know where the paper is

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,910
which one is the latest version which

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,640
review is for which version and so on of

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,370
course obviously the solution is to do

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,200
this in a wiki

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,930
could have I could have put some smiley

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,760
faces on those people actually so when

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,010
you have authors that collaborate in the

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,290
wiki to create the paper you have the

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,480
reviewers that also do the annotations

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,000
on top of that paper in that wiki and

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,340
everything is everything is integrated

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,260
in the same system so you can see always

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,409
the latest version latest modifications

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:48,129
latest reviews and so on let's see how

00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:51,760
that actually happens in X wiki so this

00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:54,760
is a demo time where I have to find the

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,510
correct window now I've created this

00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,940
very interesting document about week

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,040
about fathom which i shamelessly copied

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,810
from the internet and we can see that

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,970
some people have added some annotations

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,680
like this one here you can see the

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,329
little icon you can read the text but

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,670
you can also see the annotations on top

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:15,250
of it for example this one is a

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,310
rephrasing suggestion instead of to meet

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,340
to this is a suggestion to do to meet in

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,829
order to this is a little explanation

00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,319
like on top explanation like a little

00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:28,359
comment if you want a contextual comment

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,840
and this is also suggestion to remove

00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:34,450
this part whatever I can also add a new

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,989
annotation for example on open source

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:41,019
I'm going to see that I select I hit the

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:43,769
keyboard shortcut and I get this window

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:48,400
and I type my annotation say in as

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:54,730
defined by OC I'm going to put a link to

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:58,750
OC the open source initiative for if

00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:01,299
anyone but I guess no one so now I have

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,090
this annotation here which is being

00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:06,849
printed in the in the tooltip but as I

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,500
said X wiki is a next week is an

00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:11,829
extensible wiki you can actually define

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,919
data and then do stuff with that data so

00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,720
this table here I generated from

00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,780
structured data which I store in the

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,690
wiki it's a table of very fictive

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,030
speakers so let's look a bit a bit at

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,479
the source of this of this part of the

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:31,270
table here it is I hope you see it do

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,310
you see it should I make it bigger this

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,630
is actually the source of that table as

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,400
you can see none of the car

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,100
which is displayed in the page is

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,170
actually stored anywhere in the content

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,520
of the page it's stored in some objects

00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,620
attached to this page and there's a

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,510
little bit of velocity script there that

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:51,640
theta rays throw all objects and

00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:56,620
displace them now it's very interesting

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:59,590
that we can actually a metate this even

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,610
if the content is not there so I will

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:09,940
select this and i will add meditation

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:12,760
rephrase to strong world add a notation

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,770
then I can see the annotation here the

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,810
same for this RSS macro which displays

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,940
the latest the latest articles from the

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,590
FA's dem RSS feed I can add this

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,210
annotation here and everything works

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,610
fine even if it's not in the source of

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,170
the document now how does this work how

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,540
can I annotate stuff which are not

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,540
actually in the document it's all

00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,730
because of the rendering engine of weeks

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,770
wiki and the way it works so you have

00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,140
the page in wiki syntax the content of

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,420
the page and this page is parsed in an

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,670
abstract abstract syntax tree which has

00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,040
a note for every entity if you want

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,020
every entity in the model of the page

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,280
that you that you find a word is

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,900
actually the text that will get

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,820
displayed and then various paragraph

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,680
link and so on the metrics that we've

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,860
seen the little piece of script is a

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,020
macro and the content that is generated

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,700
by this macro is also generated in the

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,530
tree it's a bit gray here because it

00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:07,840
doesn't actually exist in the source it

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:10,450
will be generated in the tree so then we

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,610
take the annotations and we map them on

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,410
this tree how does this work the

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,480
annotations are stored as the actual

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,700
text that the user has selected with a

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,070
bit of context around it to make sure

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,360
that I can i can find the unique the

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,850
unique place because you can appear

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,790
multiple times and so on and so the text

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,770
is read is mapped on this tree and then

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,800
this tree is rendered into whatever in

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,390
this case HTML this strategy comes in

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,360
very handy when you think that it's week

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,580
is a is a is a polyglot wiki you can

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,430
have various in taxes for the input like

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,010
wiki syntax xwiki syntax mediawiki

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,950
syntax and so on and various formats for

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,420
the output like HTML or

00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,070
other things you might want to think of

00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,020
so it's very interesting that you have

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,730
annotations at the tree level because it

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,930
will work with any input and any output

00:06:53,730 --> 00:07:00,450
and that's really really cool now a wiki

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,160
is mainly about editing right you might

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,560
have already thought about that what

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,770
will happen if I edit the text on which

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,900
added the annotation so let's see I will

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:15,990
I will perform the modification here and

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:20,370
I will remove this part let's perform

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:24,060
the modification to meet in order in

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:29,370
order to and the suggestion said let's

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:33,380
remove this part here do you want me to

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,380
close my tweet deck somebody's harassing

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:43,340
so my annotation has turned orange can

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,630
see it here and if i hover i have um I

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,220
have a text telling me what was the

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,830
original text and what's the current

00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,930
text I can also validate it and say okay

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,060
it still makes sense where it is or I

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:58,500
can delete it if I don't like it let's

00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:02,190
validate it and here it has disappeared

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,380
but I haven't lost meditation because I

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,050
can go to the annotation stabbed and I

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,900
find it here I find the original text of

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,870
the annotation and the fact that it was

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,280
removed the red icon indicates the fact

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:20,990
that it was removed from the page i

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,990
couldn't map it on the page so what else

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,360
now what will happen i showed you the

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,340
the rendered content the generated

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,670
content which is annotated what will

00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:38,490
happen if I edit that assuming that I

00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:40,620
want to not display people in a in a

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,690
table anymore now you can see how easy

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,180
it is to actually program annex wiki and

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:49,310
I want to put them in a list I want to

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:54,210
put first the name of the speaker

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:56,550
followed by semicolon with the name of

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,620
the talk and in parentheses I want to

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,000
put the name of the project from which

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,110
the speaker comes

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,410
I hope I'll get this property name right

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:12,360
okay and there the structure has changed

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,460
but mana Titian has still still stays

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,280
there as you assume the same will happen

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:20,430
if a new feed comes in and if the RSS

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,250
macro changes or whatever it it works

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,440
and it manages to to find a place of the

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,580
annotation because of that because it's

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,170
actually the text which is being

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,860
annotated as long as it is in the page

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:36,870
it works and also if it modifies I'll uh

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,760
I'll show later now as I've explained

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,500
you can store a structured data and

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,110
operate with it but annotations are

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,480
nothing else but this structured data so

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,430
what if i want for example in the case

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,050
of this annotation i wanted to put to

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:54,390
put the URL what if i want to actually

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,490
to actually store this URL in a field so

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,500
that i know that it's a URL that that

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,320
provides more information about the

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,570
annotation let's do that i'm going to go

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:10,080
to the class that defines the annotation

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:14,150
structure there i'm going to say edit

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,950
and i'm going to want to edit the class

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,440
we can see here all the fields about the

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:23,010
selection and everything and i will add

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:27,450
one called reference and of type string

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:31,589
i added i see it here i can do a little

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:33,120
bit of configuration like say i want to

00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:39,690
change the pretty name i want it to

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:42,510
appear as URL i do save and view i do

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:49,920
save in view I go back to my document

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:51,630
using this great great feature and if I

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,030
want to edit this annotation you see I

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:57,620
already have the feel here and if I want

00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:01,070
to edit it by field is already here I

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,070
can fill it in

00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:10,029
and I can see it under the URL field

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,980
which is quite great now this

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,730
customization of the annotations type

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,680
and annotations you I we can see a more

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,660
of it than in the so Chrissy project

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,550
which is a project that aims to provide

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,709
an online environment for political

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,509
debate for regular users like not

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:27,430
necessarily political people but regular

00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:29,350
users they have these articles which

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,629
they comment they discuss and so on and

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,670
here we customize it quite a lot you

00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:37,149
have a mood of your of your annotation

00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:42,129
you have various other fields I can say

00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:44,649
for example that I annotate this I see

00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:46,059
that it's a I can I can choose various

00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:49,089
type I say it's an appreciation

00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:52,269
suggestion I am furious because the idea

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:56,889
is not new not clear and I completely

00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:58,870
disagree with it I admire rotation and I

00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:01,480
can see it colored the according to the

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,519
mood and so on I can also filter the

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,110
annotations by various criteria to only

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,139
see in the page the ones that I want

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,850
just quite interesting and easy easy to

00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:14,470
do enix wiki because it's just a layer

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:16,420
on top of the UI your see then it's not

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:21,189
only the UI that you can customize in

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:23,019
the Indy annotations for example for the

00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:25,360
scribble project which is a which is a

00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:27,160
project between various various

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,290
participants that aims to provide

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,870
automatic annotations automatic semantic

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,259
annotations on content and images and

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,879
everything how do we do that in X wiki

00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:38,259
you can actually take the content of a

00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,000
document send it to an external

00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:43,829
annotator which will generate some

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,870
annotations in an RDF data store and and

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:49,509
then display the annotations on the on

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,100
the wiki page so i can say analyzed this

00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:53,139
document and now the automatic

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,389
annotation annotate annotators are

00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,819
running and it automatically generated

00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:59,829
these annotations on the page I can see

00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:02,709
that forum has been identified as an

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:04,749
organization all these people here which

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:10,269
now have some real names have been

00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:12,819
identified as persons and so on how come

00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,980
all this is possible it's possible

00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:16,070
because of the modular of the modular

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,810
structure of weeks week

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,520
there's the annotation core that uses a

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,680
rendering module to do the rendering of

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,510
annotations the maintainer which I

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,220
talked about which identifies the moment

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,170
when I when a document updates and

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,570
automatically really adjust the

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,400
annotation to still make sense and the

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,800
artesian storage the annotation storage

00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,590
by default is implemented using xwiki

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,180
objects and so on but for screamo we

00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,580
could very easily just change this

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,260
module do it to make it so that it

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,630
fetches data from an RDF store

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,270
everything has remained unchanged and

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:51,320
still are still it works on top of weeks

00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:53,180
wiki then we have this rest module this

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,730
arrest interface that provides the data

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,460
to our to the annotations UI which is

00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,740
very flexible due to DJ six in the six

00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,770
extensions which deserve a talk or by

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,140
their own and for sock recy we just

00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,150
adjust a bit a bit this part everything

00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:12,380
remained unchanged and it still works

00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:15,790
properly on top of the ex wiki so thank

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:19,640
you very much you have the URLs here if

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:22,400
you download x wiki now and test it you

00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,820
get a pen and the sticker and if you

00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,700
write an expression for X aqui send us

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,970
an email and we'll send you a t-shirt

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,970
because because you can do that since

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,970
it's a very very extensible platform

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,970
thank

00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:46,220
dreadful clock shows that I still have

00:14:43,910 --> 00:15:00,430
one minute one minute and a half so are

00:14:46,220 --> 00:15:00,430
there any questions questions sorry ah

00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,730
we tried that you mean you mean chatting

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,570
in the wiki we tried that it wasn't very

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:16,370
I the question is if there if we have an

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,140
extension for chatting in the wiki we

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,360
try that it's quite easy to do actually

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,550
with an XMPP javascript library it's

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,470
very doable and without changing

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:29,450
anything on the server side just writing

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:32,450
a little little ah yeah and we have an

00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:46,130
IRC bot that stores reads from IRC and

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:47,840
stores in the wiki yes no it doesn't

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,030
have to remain the same it works it just

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,620
detects that everything was changed it

00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,030
also detects when the annotation is

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,850
changed and the text and it adjusts

00:15:53,030 --> 00:16:00,880
automatically nothing has to remain the

00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,880
same yeah

00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,800
you

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,850
