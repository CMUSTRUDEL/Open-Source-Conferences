Description: 
	By Donatus Onwunumah

An introduction to Village Telco and how it has already been implemented in developing countries.

The Village Telco is an initiative to assemble and/or develop the cheapest, easiest-to-setup, easiest-to-manage, scalable, standards-based, wireless local do-it-yourself telephone company toolkit in the world. We believe this is achievable through the use of Open Source software and low-cost, off-the-shelf, consumer communication technologies. A Village Telco offers affordable voice (and data) services through the provision of WiFi infrastructure and phones.

What makes the Village Telco different from other rural, low-cost WiFi projects, is it's focus on voices services, both from the point of view of making them work as effectively as possible at as low a cost as possible but also from the point of view of creating a sustainable business model for entrepreneurs.


FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

	00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:16,400
yes hi my name is Donna wanama I am I'm

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,400
here to present the village taco project

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,910
first question is who am i first time

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,260
I'm a software engineer of expecting

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,900
wireless systems telecom systems and

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,880
embedded software also the founder and

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,369
CTO of wireless dialog I'll come to that

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,510
later the main focus of this

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,950
presentations talk about the village

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,040
taco project first question is what is

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,989
the village taco effectively the village

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,329
tacos the locals kamini commonly

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,700
telephone network what that means is

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:53,670
that I'm not sure if you guys are aware

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,590
of the wireless mesh networking wireless

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,770
mesh networking effectively every node

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,100
becomes a gator on the router as well as

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,710
an access point what the village telco

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,930
does is take that concept and integrate

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,420
in an analog telephone adapter so you

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,369
can effectively plug in a analog device

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,920
and then an analog telephone and make

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,049
phone calls the key points are

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,380
practically sets off in minutes so you

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,740
don't have to be a bash script wizard to

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,630
set one up and also one of the key

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,450
questions was that why do you need a

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,920
village telco the main problem in

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,770
developing countries is that for access

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,930
you need mobile phone towers in Europe

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,150
we were blessed the fact that they have

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,729
that their copper and copper networks

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,560
and actually fiber networks in emerging

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,110
countries the government would not

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,509
actually invest in commercially left to

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,659
private companies to invest now us

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,920
obviously

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:55,100
looking at the bottom line they're more

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,180
interested in getting the most users

00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,340
onto the network as possible so there

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,350
are all the focus on urban areas and

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,990
I've mentioned before it's a wireless

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,689
technology I have a sample for those who

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,239
want to have a look at a unit at the

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:12,510
moment it's around 100 US dollars per

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,720
unit but that price will go down over

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,720
time

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,870
the question is why I'm not sure if you

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,129
guys are aware of the mobile telephone

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,209
network in the mobile telephone business

00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:31,310
effectively in developing countries

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:39,569
based like India and sub-saharan Africa

00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:41,790
effectively calls are very expensive the

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,069
route the rural parts of the world is

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,950
basically just been ignored affected

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:50,939
because their substance farmers they

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,439
cannot actually buy a mobile phone or a

00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,930
key and even if they do get a mobile

00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,299
phone they can actually afford the

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,739
tariff prices so effectively you said

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:06,299
well how do we then enable these guys to

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:08,609
come to become connected and obviously

00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,230
we can not only use the forum developer

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:11,669
Network um developer countries you can

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:16,709
also use it for community Wireless like

00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:20,970
the free Frank in Berlin the features of

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:24,239
it basically it's locally owned no

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,189
spectrum licensee uses the open defect

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,370
the same so no wireless mesh uses 2.4

00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:34,919
gigahertz or 5 point of order fabulous

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:36,780
plan spectrum everything about the the

00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,370
whole architecture is actually open

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,259
sourced and I'll come to that later

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,989
and obviously the focus on rapid

00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:46,620
deployment and this Tennessee

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,659
Constitution parts we have a basic I

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,519
have a building server and within the

00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,549
box itself that's embedded asterix

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,060
embedded inside open wrt and if you guys

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,530
are familiar with open wrt obviously

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,530
this would be a no holds bar for you to

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,109
do and we're actually developed a truly

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,819
open source mesh Matamata map intro so

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,930
you can actually be able to configure

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:12,509
and actually administer your network

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:16,380
this graph that shows the amount of

00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:18,180
Internet users in Africa so we're

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,049
wireless dialog is basically trying to

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,870
encourage internet usage as you can see

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:27,180
here 70 80 % of the population are

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:33,479
connected and we're talking about

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:35,490
tempis underpopulation so our business

00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,660
model is to take the McDonald's that

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:42,750
model so effectively we get local

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:47,190
entrepreneurs to actually buy in to the

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:49,380
business world so we give them this

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,789
service we give them training and we all

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,070
show up and provide them with support

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:56,850
and then we could then set up a local

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,590
locally owned wireless sensor for the

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,300
villages now obviously the cost within

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,580
that network is free and will quote

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,870
provide better services one of the main

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,340
things that the profits go back into

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,099
getting work with maintaining more time

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,949
the village connected now the beauty of

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,660
that is is dis transfer lized the

00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:13,889
communication network is not owned by

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,210
the government or by the private

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,460
companies and obviously you all know

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,889
happen in Egypt effectively the secure

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,599
switch with this obviously with this

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,250
system you can't have a kill switch it's

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:31,020
owned by the people and it's controlled

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:32,729
by the people and finally if you want to

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,419
consider them to the website village

00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:38,220
telco dog it's an excellent place for

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,260
court of information and also join the

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,400
Google Group so if your hacker as most

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:47,010
of you are you can join in we have the a

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,639
2 billion author that monitor the group

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:53,159
we have still Steve song who's a shuttle

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,349
fellow and we also have Elektra she's

00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:57,810
the author of the Batman demon so if you

00:05:55,349 --> 00:06:01,680
guys are familiar open wrt you know that

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:06,449
she's a very very keen i'm develop honor

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,770
unmask technology and obviously you can

00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,900
go to wireless dialog on the card

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,630
website or or email me for my

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,099
information and that's it

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,099
any questions

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:28,450
the question is how do you measure

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:31,690
quality under network um one of the main

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,120
focus is talking about quality quality

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,700
of service one of the main focus of this

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,320
was that to be able to use this

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,840
obviously you're you're sharing a

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,910
boundary between voice and data exactly

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,520
but if you think about it

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,680
although the wireless infrastructure

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,440
here in Europe is actually quite

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,750
congested in most of those regions there

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,710
is no wireless network so effectively

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,210
you have gonna have a single link

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,010
obviously again with the benefits of

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,410
using mesh technologies that the more

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,580
nodes you have the more routing

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,860
capabilities you're gonna have so the

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,260
more infrastructure you build so fifty

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,080
hundred five hundred nodes the better a

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,680
network becomes and obviously will by

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,930
building on a single router rather i

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,260
congest in the space with multiple

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,860
multiple multiple routers every router

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:26,020
is actually actually utilizing network

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,650
properly and obviously there's actually

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,870
new the first leading routing algorithm

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,590
made by Elektra called batman' advanced

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,750
and that's a layer two routing algorithm

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,920
so you effectively access the switch so

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,840
it means you can have multiple servers

00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,630
on top of that now basically it means I

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:50,640
have a huge wireless LAN network that's

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:50,640
totally invisible to the user thank you

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:59,600
they hide in nodes the question is how

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,670
the result program but they hide in

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,730
nodes I've never come across that

00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:07,220
problem myself I think what what what

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:10,580
you find is that it depends on the

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,470
routing algorithm that you use if you if

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,760
if you're gonna build a fix because most

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,090
of time we're gonna be the fixed

00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,740
wireless so if you look at all o LSR and

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,030
if you look at Batman you have to

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,830
actually look at what you're building

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,150
how you can design your network so you

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,190
actually comes down to how you design a

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,500
wireless network initially so you say

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,550
well if I'm gonna have nose moving

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,950
around constantly

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,599
now which routes an algorithm do I use a

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,090
mooch on is more preference so I always

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,160
find I did you know the weakest part of

00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,289
the point is which argument I ratted are

00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:48,980
going to use initially and that mostly

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:50,300
solves your problem the question is do I

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,280
have relations with the server back from

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,460
projects actually the server bat-phone

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:58,160
project is a fork of this village telco

00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,480
project poor gardener Stephens he

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,370
actually approached the group and say

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,220
that he wants to explore and extend it

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,230
obviously being opposite of what it is

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,510
it was welcome he's actually putting put

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,180
in for those I don't know the bat-phone

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,550
project actually utilizes embedded

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,040
access inside an android phone it's

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:20,510
effectively an Android phone acts as his

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:24,200
own telco router an access point so you

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:26,540
can make calls within the village toko

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,560
network without incurring any cost the

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,950
operator and that's just for the photos

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,950
I don't know

00:09:41,829 --> 00:10:00,079
so you're gonna pay the question the

00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:01,429
question is I'm trying to rephrase that

00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:05,779
- sure

00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:09,589
short sentence the question is in terms

00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:12,699
of in reality you know how do you ensure

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:15,980
that do we actually build decentralized

00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:18,399
and totally unconnected networks which

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,109
are not connect to the rest of the world

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,589
in our experience we find out most

00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:26,209
people once connect to the world and the

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:27,589
biggest problem which is obviously we

00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:32,209
can't solve with the video store afford

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:34,759
ADA fact that the isp licenses restricts

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:36,619
you from actually gatoring so

00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:40,189
governments have actually licensed the

00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:43,489
spectrum specifically for the big telcos

00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:47,629
so as a small local IP you have to

00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:49,910
basically pay maybe 35,000 to 40,000 per

00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:56,179
year in license costs now if you

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:58,189
approach you know the Belgium operators

00:10:56,179 --> 00:11:00,350
in terms of actually have been an ISP

00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:03,259
it's virtually no cost so you can see

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,669
the imbalance there so that's not so

00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:05,199
that's a major hurdle for us at the

00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:10,489
moment

00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:13,309
hopefully with with the coming of fire

00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:15,980
by broadband across the west coast of

00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:17,600
Africa main one and I think and a few

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,109
others we should be able to levy that

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,779
problem but again this is not part of

00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:27,730
this talk about with which we can't

00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:30,019
actually build locally owned and locally

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,809
provided services so locally designed

00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:34,579
websites local local servers everything

00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:36,470
locally derived for the local languages

00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:41,679
so hopefully that problem should be

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,679
alleviated yes please

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,340
the question is how to configure IP

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:53,560
address to the mesh node is actually

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:55,450
very very basic the key point is that

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,530
between five clicks you can average you

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:01,210
complete to configure a mashed-potato so

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,190
there's actually a guide if you go to

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,670
the village talk or dog I'm I don't

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,650
wanna go through too much detail here

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:11,950
effectively you know that's a special

00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:21,100
facility you can actually FTP in into

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:26,550
using a crossover cable sorry no no no

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,550
no the modem is manually yes yes please

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,360
the question is what am i franchisee oh

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,890
and what do a franchisee charge the

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,720
customers now this is a this is where we

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,730
we usually call the tiered model so we

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,010
provide services to the enterprises to

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,230
the huge companies and them in turn

00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,740
subsidize the price of the equipment

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,540
going in to these small businesses and

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,030
to the small entrepreneurs so obviously

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,130
this number is don't bad on a local

00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,540
basis you cannot want to charge the same

00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,740
price stuff for cutter you charge

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,560
somewhere in each year for instance

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,760
because the income the EM the income

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,070
difference that does too great

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,000
so we do it by a base case by case basis

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:11,710
and obviously if they if big enterprises

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,250
that actually want to locate within that

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:17,350
region if they take our services part of

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,760
the agreement is that within that mesh

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,920
network they decorated for themselves

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,260
their career to connect on user downlink

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,150
and then obviously reduce the cost to

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:30,390
arm to the small village intrapreneur

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,390
yes please

00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,550
the question is who I would design the

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,690
hardware for that for basically the

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,449
limitations that you have of wireless

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:56,839
networking yeah the answer is the only

00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:58,790
the only closed propriety hardware

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,360
inside of a circle is actually an

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:04,730
atheros chip unfortunately it cost about

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,709
quarter of a million dollars to actually

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,410
get the code within that to actually

00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:11,720
then modify the blobs as you say to

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,699
actually make the route more efficient

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,339
now obviously we were not a

00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:19,040
software-defined radios we sort of

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:21,769
talked yesterday about FPGAs hopefully

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,629
once that barrier have been opened up

00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:25,970
because at the moment it's just really

00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,199
literally impossible for us it's so

00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,420
design your own radio chip but

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,430
everything else is open sourced but the

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,990
following is not answer your question is

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:43,120
we how is to have the limitation yes any

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:43,120
