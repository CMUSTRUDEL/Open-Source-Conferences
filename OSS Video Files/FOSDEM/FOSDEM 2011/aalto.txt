I don't hear from

00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,390
Nana supplied using open source

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,210
labor

00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:23,020
we're and well let's be a bit the

00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:25,630
pointer is okay the pointer it's only

00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,300
for blossom so from where I come from

00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,340
which i am doing i come from finland and

00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,070
not finish for wo men will have a yellow

00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,780
hair ok but more or less i come from the

00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,250
aalto university at university is the

00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,650
product of the marriage of three

00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,570
universities in villain helsinki school

00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,760
of economics helsinki school of art of

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,829
design and the formerly helsinki

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,199
university of technology with this new

00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:49,870
merch we got a new task the tax is to

00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,160
build the first finish satellite ok it's

00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,980
going to be a small satellite but

00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,230
university got the task we have some

00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,019
kind of consortium with a lot of

00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,079
companies involved but mostly it's built

00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:04,269
by the students through buckle or feces

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,860
masterpieces the fitted am currently in

00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,930
our project we have like 50 students

00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,330
involved from different levels backcolor

00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,010
mustard peach tea and of course the

00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,330
payloads that for people that is not

00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,180
familiar with the concept of pale of

00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,290
teen said in the satellites is like the

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,610
important change in the satellite are

00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:24,909
built by established companies

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:27,700
laboratories etc so this is all the 10

00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:29,409
this is how its look in one year ok

00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,600
right now we are in the preliminary

00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,909
design we are taking all of these

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,850
decisions about what is to do and in

00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,259
which way ok and we know all this that

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,869
is going to have this appearance because

00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:43,479
we are following some global standards

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:46,810
to do this satellite I will talk in the

00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,880
nessus I'd about this but briefly some

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,710
points about the Alta one project ok of

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,939
course if we are building this is not

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:58,329
just too much help for the microphone it

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,100
is not for for fun only we are building

00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:02,289
this because we have extended objectives

00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,509
and also university abilities to try to

00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,180
educate better engineers we try to

00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:08,869
promote the science technology and

00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:13,129
science

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:14,780
no let's in Finland and we have a really

00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:16,370
nice goal that is lunch the first finish

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,610
at a lie that always is some kind of

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,140
incentive really nice incentive more or

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,790
less is trying to promote the research

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,840
in this field in a country as feelin

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,909
okay the standards that we are doing in

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,769
the satellite our basket in the US have

00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:33,920
design specification maybe some of you

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:36,680
is familiar with this specification it's

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,870
fitted specification comes from stanford

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,930
and california polytechnic institute and

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,940
more or less they are telling us when I

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,680
say telling us telling to everyone that

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,769
is interested in billa small satellite

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,620
how its look what is the maximum weight

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:54,349
which is the dimensions etc in our case

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,940
I guess that is the maximum dimensions

00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,760
is a video type it means that is going

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,230
to be less than four kilograms okay and

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,109
at the same time we are trying to follow

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,819
the FECA standards it's an kind of pure

00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:07,640
European standards for everything

00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:10,159
concerning a satellite it's some kind of

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,560
in sinus tough but I guess that nobody's

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,630
following completely but they're giving

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,000
us a lot of nice information we will use

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,489
a open source at what happens or sorry

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,459
open up at the right frequency okay it

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:23,989
means that anyone let's cafe rio in the

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,700
home that can synchronize with this

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,049
frequency could fetch the data from the

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,389
satellite as you can do right now with

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,919
all the satellites and well we are

00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:35,419
testing all of recording with the

00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:37,519
standard space and etc so this is a

00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:42,379
preliminary steam about how it's going

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:45,109
to be internally at the one okay and we

00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:47,239
can see here well we can have the right

00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:49,129
radius of 16 communication we have

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,870
cleared the spectrometer we have this

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:54,109
ballad dinner we have the batteries but

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,419
this is not jose this is not tellin you

00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,709
nothing about the satellite more or less

00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,569
i'm going to talk briefly about the

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,730
payloads we are going to send three

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:05,449
payloads okay three important things

00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:07,010
that are a electro plasma break that is

00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:09,620
going to try to prove new maintenance

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,970
for the better in satellites we are

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,530
going to put a spectrometer that is

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,319
going to send it's going to be also in a

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,030
mission in mercury in 2014 and we are

00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,229
going to put know we are going to put

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,820
our radiation monitor and Renee's

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:20,810
monitor is going to win this mission now

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,380
we are going to take all of this

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,550
extensive data from them

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,350
and we're going to send to their thang

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,580
we are going to put there for you okay

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,630
and for people that is interested in

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,520
this kind of data well in this satellite

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,230
is going to be a main board computer

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,510
also collect all we see on-board

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,610
computer is the computer in chance of

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,290
taking care of all the things the

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,210
daytime protest to send to their

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,920
whatever and i'm going to talk here

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,050
about the software that we are going to

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,150
use their have leave some fellows mon

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,320
loads how good what is going to be there

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,490
and wife as money to the cinema

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,620
nanosatellite well I don't know

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,770
satellite the name is telling you that

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,120
is small okay it's embedded system in

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,120
this case is going to be more or less

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,650
these dimensions okay it's a delicate

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,480
artifact I guess that it's obvious that

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,760
we can go there and reboot it is

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,370
something that is tricky right now and

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,380
it's using real-time data do it to the

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,920
payloads are well fitting the data in

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,240
real time and this is more or less the

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,600
point of this mission try to get the

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,790
data and well we don't have too much

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,040
power because it's a small satellite so

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,540
the solar cells are going to be a small

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,050
so everything is going to be very

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,460
limited so it's really complex and it's

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,140
really difficult to test because they

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,150
space if you don't know that I guess

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,040
that you know but it's a joke it's

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:42,780
different than there ok we cap abrasion

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,280
we have radiation etc and well the

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,500
companies that we are using there are

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,230
not ready for this kind of environment

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,760
so it's a bit tricky to test our normal

00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,470
is expensive real expensive but this is

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,180
our diversity and we don't care we try

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,720
to do in a cheaper way and the best way

00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,240
and try our best this is a generalist in

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,400
about the system design ok here you can

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,630
see the ground segment is the salmon

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
that is going to be in the university is

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,010
going to be the ground station ok this

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,100
is the satellite a segment we can hear

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,470
different subsystems and this is the

00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,660
part that made in and me we are in terms

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,310
of design and implement ok the on-board

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,870
computer the embarked on puter is going

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,760
to take care about this suspect remitted

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,260
theta radiation monitor electro plasma

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,540
break that what is going to be also

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,830
manipulating at the same time is going

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,810
to be in charge of the communication

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,460
subsystem the attitude determination and

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:34,040
control system etc

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,560
here is more or less the interface

00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,410
control some kind of draft okay who is

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,150
going to be the information flowing

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,479
around the system we're going to use the

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,919
i2c protocol well i justit subsystem and

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,180
we are going to fetch the data from here

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,539
and we are going to protesting the board

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,460
computers but kid cans we are going to

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,729
open some liberal software conference

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,960
and we're going to talk about software

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,660
we need something simple and extensible

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,250
it is just obvious okay a satellite is

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,310
something complex we can put windows

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:08,000
there so when it's also something

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,740
reliable we can put Windows teeny

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,979
but functional I guess that we can put

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,169
top gusto also because our payloads it's

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,840
something we can consider that all the

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,729
satellites are trying kind of joining a

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,560
machines why because well all of them

00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:23,599
they have a specific mission so we will

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,099
need some a specific software from made

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,710
of course according with the

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,910
specification of what payloads and this

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,320
will be thought to be working in the

00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,240
worst scenario because in the space

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,280
everything that happened it should be

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,460
full tested and of course we should be

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,919
we should release everything and this is

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,680
something that i would like to remark

00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:45,320
right now we have a really what many

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,139
many many satellites in the space and i

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,370
will say that we don't know how work any

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,990
of them we don't know what is happening

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,760
there because we have all of these

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,680
governmental agencies that well they try

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,229
to be transparent and they well they are

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,639
getting something but we don't know what

00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:00,380
is happening and i guess that if we are

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,760
trusting the satellites we are trusting

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,710
the data we should know also how the

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,349
data is manipulate I mean we're a

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,870
software guys more of us and we know

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,389
that a small integer can modify a huge

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,370
variable so i guess that is something

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,110
that we can or we like to introduce in

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,699
alto one that you should have the

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,710
capability to check the software that is

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:20,330
running there in your computer ok this

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,280
is how they are getting the relation

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,520
later this is how they are getting less

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,080
petra metadata this is or objective ok

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,300
so how we are going to do this this is

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,699
maybe something crazy for people that is

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,440
in the same industry of the space

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,599
technology we are going to bed for the

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,990
linux kernel applying real-time patches

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,669
a satellite subic a fat real-time system

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,919
four different question that is out of

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,270
the scope the operating system is going

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,399
to be a custom distribution we're going

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,260
to do something that you probably know

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,850
the pale of software is going to be

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,660
homemade we don't know the language yet

00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,130
but we will bed for C C++ o sampler the

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,050
growler station is going to use general

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,120
review and they predict a Predator is an

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,500
application for tracking satellites and

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,420
the data distribution is going to be

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,459
about using public website audience

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,779
audience which is appropriate that is

00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:07,820
trying to coordinate all the ground

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,680
stations around the world and try to

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,959
interpolate them and then providing the

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,399
data for everyone that is connected it

00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,779
some kind of well when you are taking a

00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,180
satellite the satellite is only visible

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:19,339
for a couple of minutes so if you'll

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,020
have a relay station every country or in

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,880
different latitude is going to be really

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,100
difficult to follow your satellite 24

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,510
hours but with this kind of network we

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,670
will have the capability to set for

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,170
instance to Brasilia Brazil can you take

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,610
a look about my satellite can you send

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,390
these comments it's something like that

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,890
the general idea well the colonel is

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,899
going to be highly customized is going

00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,279
to be really cleaning we don't know yet

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,290
as I said we are in the preliminary

00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,000
design phase it's going to be focused

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,800
for I to see and it's going to be also

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,260
really focusing professor scheduling

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,440
different priorities and other operating

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,750
systems in real time maybe for 300 20 in

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,270
tens of levels it's going to use the

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,279
real-time patches right now the idea is

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,589
to use open in bed as basement for the

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,490
distro because maybe someone comes in

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:02,570
and say why you don't create your own

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,160
distro well because we are doing a

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,640
satellite we have enough problems okay

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,420
so we don't want greater on distribution

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,310
deterministic system something real

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,750
important in satellites or I guess in of

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,700
them by the systems that you should know

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,680
the state of the system but how is going

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,540
to be to do perform an operation and

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,190
also really important the time that is

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,630
going to take if i go to say to the

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,860
satellite please take me a photo i

00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,690
should know that in one min it is going

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,070
to be a photo anything if in women is

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,510
not a photo there is because if

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,890
something is wrong okay it's not

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,680
behaving properly so it should be

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,329
deterministic and this is a hell altona

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,180
most it means that if for some reason we

00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:36,740
lost the communication with it we can

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,420
say to the satellite a please do this at

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,950
this at least satellite should have the

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,870
mission is to know that a I should

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,209
perform these operations I shall do this

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,500
this and this man while okay

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,430
communications we are having in mind

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,940
Eva's for inter process communication

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,180
but maybe it's out of scope also talk

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,460
about this here

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,290
fail of software teeny simple available

00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,900
client-server architecture is going to

00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,160
behave in that way that if the pain of

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,380
software for instance if the

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,210
spectrometer goes down we to lock the

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,040
software and that is all this is not

00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,720
like San operating system that you know

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,460
that you broke a printed and then

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,290
everything class now we can we can allow

00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,970
that we can we should have the

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,530
capability to say we don't need the

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,810
software anymore it's going to be

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,340
designed to use in userspace memory it

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,660
means release related from the colonel

00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,110
it shouldn't have the capability to

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,880
class the system and will be GPL contact

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,290
with the ground station we are going to

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,060
use gnu/linux we are going to use

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,250
general review on custom software that

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,020
of course also we will put a medieval on

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,180
the net we provide for real-time

00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,430
satellite tracking connect to Jensen

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,470
ignore collaborating with a song with

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,120
other satellites and the ground station

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,160
will be in the Church of the data

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,810
publication and of course will be busy

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,520
table if you like a county like Finland

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,790
with metal of us know you are welcome

00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,650
please but tend to visit us and finally

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,960
data distribution how is going to be the

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,580
data well normally something that is

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,520
finding Sunday scan these projects is

00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,680
that when they fetch the data they using

00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,210
the papers and Aaden put in unit we will

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,980
put a lot of work into the data for

00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,210
everyone even if you don't have clue

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,560
about what she needs our pet remitted

00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,120
you should have the capability to have a

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,430
tip file in your desktop and say to

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,380
someone eh I have a spectrometer data I

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,980
don't know which means but I don't love

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,890
it okay this is the idea a license

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,380
prolly pulley the line we don't know yet

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,540
this is also distribution through gensou

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,880
project maybe some API that you can

00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,280
check we have one project of reference

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,870
in the SS feel the Stanford project that

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,820
they are so in everything from the

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,320
satellite and even they have the

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,090
capability what you have the capability

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,950
to send a comment to the satellite and

00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,410
you enter in a queue and they deliberate

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,670
you the photo is really nice a stuff and

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,060
of course the data distribution will be

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,400
useful so this is the idea we are going

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,190
to put a satellite there that is going

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,740
to have open source sliver software

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:54,570
running we will publish everything there

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:57,060
and ideas critics suggestions money for

00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,240
the project whatever is welcome thank

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:09,070
you for your time

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:13,870
I have one minute according with the

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:19,770
clock so some questions yeah please in

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,770
the UK the Archangel

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,779
Vincent I just like make everything free

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,759
we're doing with making free I can you

00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:34,970
repeat the question Jake I kept writing

00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:36,170
gpo software Lucy on the bus mmm as far

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,290
as i know we don't have any problem with

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,389
that i say that finland is quite pensive

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,040
with that so much fun can you repeat the

00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,939
question well the question was something

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,259
that if we are going to have some

00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:48,079
problem releasing the software because

00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:50,209
we with come from University I don't

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:55,459
think so remember that Lina's born in

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:57,730
Finland more questions like up 50

00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,730
seconds

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,940
yeah actually it's not the like two

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,770
great like windows of data boom to

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,480
package manager but yes we will have the

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,070
capability to reflash the system we will

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,680
have the capability to send you software

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:20,380
as the master Robert has I mean right

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:22,150
now in okay we will have that capability

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,510
but the problem is that i didn't mention

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:28,030
that because it's got really deep is

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:30,040
that the rugged banquets that we have is

00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,170
a bit it is really really small so we

00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,300
can perform some updates but really

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,300
