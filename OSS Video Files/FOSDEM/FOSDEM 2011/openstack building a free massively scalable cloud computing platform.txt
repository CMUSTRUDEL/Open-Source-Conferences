 A developer's look into Openstack architecture

OpenStack is a very new, very popular cloud computing project, backed by Rackspace and NASA. It's all free software (Apache Licensed) and is in production use already.

A developer's look into Openstack architecture

OpenStack is a very new, very popular cloud computing project, backed by Rackspace and NASA. It's all free software (Apache Licensed) and is in production use already.

It's written entirely in Python and uses Twisted, Eventlet, AMQP, SQLAlchemy, WSGI and many other high quality libraries and standards.

We'll take a detailed look at the architecture and dive into some of the challenges we've faced building a platform that is supposed to handle millions of gigabytes of data and millions of virtual machines, and how we've dealt with them.

There will be time at the end for Q&A about cloud computing in general and Openstack in particular.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org
