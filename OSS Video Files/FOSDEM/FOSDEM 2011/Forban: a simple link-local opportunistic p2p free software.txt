Title: Forban: a simple link-local opportunistic p2p free software
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	By Alexandre Dulaunoy
 
An introduction to the Forban free software and its epidemic protocol in less than 14 minutes. 1 minute about the "abuse" of p2p epidemic protocols for fun and freedom.

Forban is a kind of p2p (peer2peer) filesharing application for link-local and local area network written in Python. Forban works independently from Internet and use only the local area capabilities to announce, discover, search or share files. Forban relies on HTTP and he is opportunistic (meaning replicating any files seen in his proximity or interest). The name took his origins from the old French word (a forban is a kind of pirate). "Forban" can be also a play word in English at a time where government or corporate want to ban access to the Internet.


FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

two things first them because

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,099
and I think as we are doing technologies

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,099
for sure

00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,870
so we talk about something called for mo

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,870
you can policy with a French accent so

00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:26,869
if my French accent but football is a

00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,880
play world between for bond like the

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:32,029
pie-rats but photobomb like for ban

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,250
meaning banging on the internet and I

00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:38,390
will explain all the background of the

00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:41,420
project is a 15 minute I've basically

00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:44,890
because the project is a came out from

00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:48,559
out some homes from some frustration out

00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:52,160
so the first thing that is very

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,199
important it's right now the legal

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,230
framework so the copyright law and so on

00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,239
is basically limiting your ability to

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,219
share information and to share with

00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:03,980
known our neighbor or your friends is

00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:08,570
becoming very complex and very difficult

00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:11,240
and that's for us a very key point why

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,380
we give up for boys we want something

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,250
that we can share with friend and

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,540
neighbor without too much difficulty

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,970
another problem that we have seen is

00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,090
basically editors so there was one

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:25,189
publishing books or publisher basically

00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,310
trying to kill her the conviviality in

00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:30,350
the society so whatever you try to do

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,780
for exchanging books and so on they try

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:36,380
to limit your kappas capability of

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,270
exchanging books and worse I think I Ben

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,189
McGlynn took it to talk about it on this

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,430
morning is internet start to be

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:45,320
controlled so more and more loads are

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,030
limiting your behavior on the internet

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,280
so for example if you start to share on

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,439
the internet now you receive letter and

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,649
even worse you get block from the

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,930
internet and I want you to take the

00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:59,810
example of the books because books are

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,850
here you're part of our society we for

00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,820
my personal point of view I can't live

00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:07,399
without books which you can learn from

00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,310
it you can run chance you can learn

00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,750
engineering you can escape from the

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,110
world it's a great thing

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:19,500
books start to be a bit useless with

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,600
those bloody drm the kind of digital a

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,720
constriction when I run tools where

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,720
basically the editor are pushing the

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,459
limits and try to avoid all the nice

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,820
functionality we add with physical books

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:35,820
and limits people buying books and limit

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,120
the ability to share books so that

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,709
that's why we were wondering because

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,250
currently with physical book it's very

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:46,709
easy to go to a traditional library to

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,320
get a book to rent a book to to lend the

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,860
book it's very easy no with digital

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,570
books is it easy is it more difficult it

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,790
start to be very strange because

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,340
basically the library is not able any

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,709
more to share books so I think we have

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,070
to come talk balances that we have to

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:08,280
maybe play the role of the liebherr

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:10,739
liebherr are aliens and transfer by

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,690
yourself all your books and that was the

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,850
crazy idea we had so basically football

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,209
started as the discussions you know one

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,209
of those crazy discussion between gigs

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:27,750
and the major question we are where the

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:30,090
following first one let's can we do

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,330
file-sharing Wizards internet and I

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,940
think two days it's very easy computers

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,690
are everywhere each one is basically a

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,400
full-blown computer so sharing start to

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,220
be very easy setting up a wireless

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,459
network so personal area network is very

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,640
easy another thing that we discover it's

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:53,610
basically more easy to exchange or share

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,620
books with San Jose why buy you go to

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,360
usenet or you start your peer-to-peer

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,910
clients and you start to look for books

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,560
but basically the guys we are sharing

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,049
books or girls we are showing the books

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,400
with you are basically strangers why is

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,439
not easier with your friends

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,049
I always think we were wondering if if

00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,760
we start a new project we want to start

00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,769
something very small and simple and we

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,459
don't want to start by a very complex

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,590
project I don't think that in- security

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,130
do do we really care about security when

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,810
we do file sharing and something should

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,789
not say about it because i'm working in

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,699
security we completely forget about

00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:33,070
security because it's for us opinions

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:35,070
yes to handle and manage so that's why

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,870
we started to work on this project I

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:41,380
want you to make a very simple protocol

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,970
when we have been very kind of proximity

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,000
so that means when you are close to a

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,949
friend or do you do sharing right now we

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,199
when you having to in a bookshelf or

00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,760
next to a bookshelf you just share with

00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,530
your friends which kind of book you have

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,630
so you look at book cover and you

00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,340
exchange books it's very sad for us so

00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,900
that's that's means the technology need

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,260
to be a simple so that's why we created

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,990
formal with some basic objective and

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,940
some basic technical recommendations

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,630
first we wanted to basically here rely

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,020
on the HTTP protocol without going to

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,889
very complex stuff we just had to add

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,740
extensions to do the annals but

00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:20,979
basically is full-blown HTTP so you can

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,310
use any HTTP client out there to access

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:26,199
sum 41 notes something else that we

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,930
didn't care too much in the initial

00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,960
prototype is bandwidth optimizations and

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,520
so on so that means if you have a formal

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,030
know that would use up all the bandwidth

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,530
and they will do best effort so for the

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,560
first version it might be some time

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,780
unstable but it's quite interesting to

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,180
for design leader protocol so I'm seeing

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,260
that we discussed two is we want it to

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,000
have something that is hitting the

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,860
pattern from files format and file

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,970
structure used when something that

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,850
people are just putting filings

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,110
automatically replicated

00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,820
something that is quite important a lot

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,350
of networks are basically in stable

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,710
that's means they are going up and down

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:07,330
very often wireless networks are used to

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:10,370
be unstable maybe you see at first them

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,860
it's very easy if you are not closer

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,520
we're very close to the access point you

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,259
might be not afraid less access so it's

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,120
physically unstable so you have to take

00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,840
into consideration such kind of think

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,729
and the idea is basically to have a

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:29,389
prototype that can be implemented that

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:31,490
in even remixes and and that's very

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,680
important for us its variant it's an

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,490
early experiment so don't expect

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,349
everything to work perfectly but

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,900
basically we wanted to have his software

00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,789
so we just implemented the idea and

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,280
after what we hope the other people will

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:49,940
get other versions and other idea based

00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,860
on this idea so as always I say it's you

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,259
can blame us for what we are doing but

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,000
we are doing something so if you see a

00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:59,419
problem so if you want to improve the

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,400
protocol it's fine is great but shows

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:06,770
the code so the core concept between for

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,090
Boyd's different mode of operations but

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,030
the main mode is called the

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,789
opportunistic mode what is all about the

00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,889
opportunistic mode is read as the name

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:18,229
stands it's an opportunist so that's

00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:20,169
what is sharing everything and it's

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:23,620
copying everything

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:26,800
in the academic literature you can see

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,800
it as a well-known protocol epidemic

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,240
protocol or go sip protocol so that's

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,919
basically keeping everything as ice

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,430
another mode chef mode where you can

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,430
share everything sorry

00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:55,460
and you have another mode another mode

00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:10,560
great and your values of mode where you

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,590
can basically get any fat you want so oh

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,560
it looks like it so easy what do you see

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,350
it's all the modem IV a bit on the

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,200
networks here you see one could edit it

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:28,139
and you see another one call Clarisse my

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:29,700
clients each know dad's files that are

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:34,169
basically books or whatever you want to

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,729
share they are seen ipv4 and ipv6 like

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,770
you can see basically the files missing

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:42,589
between a lot so this one is Kleist my

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:46,279
clients and she's missing 567 files

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:48,900
that's how it works on the interface

00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:52,800
obviously we are not use user interface

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:56,670
designer but the idea is every notes see

00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,089
each other so to go maybe deeper into

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:03,230
the systems it all it works is basically

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:07,279
you having a wireless network you have

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:10,080
to 41 notes One is using the opportunist

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,050
opportunistic moda to default mode and

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,510
now using the shaft mode was basically

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:20,790
sharing files but without getting the

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:22,800
files so all those it works that's very

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,540
easy the opportunistic mode is getting

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,880
all the files from the shared one and

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,370
stacking all the files so that's

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,970
basically a simple fetch and match for

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,970
the fight

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,510
imagine a third night is coming into the

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,930
wireless so basically is entering the

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,250
wireless networks you see you have

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,050
steves opportunistic ones you have the

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,630
chef mode 1 and you have a node without

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,100
any files this one is going into the

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,920
network and you will basically do the

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,170
same thing as the previous one you will

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,750
see the two nodes get all the content

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,230
and that's it so that means each node is

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:03,880
basically duplicating all the content

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:06,550
that's very brute force but it works so

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:11,519
you see no end certain orders all the

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:16,209
files it works even with a web browser

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:18,850
if you know where the four boys you can

00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:21,510
get and browse any directory you want

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,279
all you boys it is very straightforward

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,279
you basically go to the interface and

00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:30,660
you hear a small button browse and you

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,660
can browse any files

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:38,210
so let's meet any web browser should

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:40,550
work out of the box how does it works so

00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,170
the technical people over here I it's

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,560
very simple we have an announced

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,970
protocol to just do the announce I'm

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,480
pretty sure we'll get questioned about

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,550
this why don't we use rendezvous gnss d

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,190
and son it's basically because we wanted

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,890
one single message containing all the

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,040
information so that means if the index

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:04,970
is new so stops IP and son doing this

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,550
with a gnss dior ssdp or any of those

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,500
protocol it's very complex so that's

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,000
basically a fruiting protocol with just

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,890
regular Leaf reading the network with a

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,520
new UDP frame in v4 and v6 each for one

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:22,100
is known by a unique edgy this unique ID

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,230
is undamaged elated is feeding the

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,940
networks and each fall ball is

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,520
maintaining the lists of all the one

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,610
discover that's basically it and

00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,589
afterwards in us all to get the index

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:37,630
files so it's basically using the HTTP

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,630
protocol to get each files

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,630
so what does it always a fool for my

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,420
looks like the format is basically no

00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,920
binary format it's a full text format so

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,660
you have a source interface that's

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,550
basically where the anons is coming from

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,550
and in this nation you see we are using

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:56,550
broadcasts or multicast in click link

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,470
local addresses for the anons what's

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,440
inside basically you're a dress code for

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,050
ball and you have a key value entry with

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,300
a none of the fur ball the unique ID and

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:10,770
the ashmac and the ashmac is basically

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:13,620
the index ash of this formal if the

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,960
index I change it will be changed right

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,940
now see a schmuck is Arkady to one key

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,070
but it can't be the belated after to

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,250
have private formal with a specific

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,080
network while we are doing this it's

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,500
basically a simple protocol so that

00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,810
means you can have in one liner using

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,910
TCP dump or Wireshark whatever you want

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,620
so that's been doing scripting around

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,640
the product code is very easy because

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:41,030
what you can do is you can filter on

00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,920
listen online interface get the pedo

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:47,820
filter on the default pole that we are

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,370
using is 12 5 55 and look for the

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,680
beginning of gdp fan for football that's

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:57,590
that's it and exactly have what you have

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:59,910
is a one-liner containing the anons easy

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,590
afterwards when you know how to reach

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,080
inform one you can get the index or you

00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:08,310
get index you basically use a social IP

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,740
addresses from shannons use a different

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,350
destination prada to get to and you

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,500
download indexed what is indexed it's it

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:19,170
can be less not simple on that is

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:23,870
basically the file paths with a file

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:27,050
name and the size of the files that's it

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:29,270
what is index is basically a text files

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,870
containing recursively all the files

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:35,960
available in the shared electron blue

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,480
total sales and everyone come fetch this

00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,760
file and the file is a text file Twitter

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,110
than limitations it's a whole files and

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,690
so it's not you GF on credit whatsoever

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,560
it's depending of what each dot is doing

00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,480
so that might be a column in some case

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,610
what you get a file basically the same

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,490
stuff you get the files it's a get

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,110
method you still use the information

00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,660
that you get from the sauce interface

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:03,770
you uncle the file name from the index

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:06,200
as a base64 ull safe encoder and that's

00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,300
it and you get the files from the web

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,990
interface it's work from the same way

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:15,130
you just ever content dispositions to

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:17,690
make everyone happy all the

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:20,210
opportunistic modem this one is very

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:23,830
simple to is basically comparing oils

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:26,390
index doing a diff of each index and

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,860
merging into a single files and

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,830
downloading the files that are meetings

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,500
that's basically it nothing very complex

00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,750
you can build filters to extract some

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,180
files but yoga rhythm is not that much

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:42,020
complex if you can add the code i think

00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:44,390
this party's around 25 lines of pythons

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,000
so nothing else oh if you can do it in

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,190
if you want to do it in dash blower or

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,870
your favorite language or your favorite

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:54,100
scripting language the language you can

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,300
do it that's pretty straightforward

00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,370
there is something that quite

00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,910
interesting that I think works to

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:03,100
mention is basically as uses index is

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,649
relying on find them we don't look at

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,980
your ash of the files so that means and

00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:11,290
that was a good question from TS if you

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,990
have files with basically the same file

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:20,230
name always you will keep only the

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:22,810
largest file and that's it so do you

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,360
want to chart for them so I've might

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:33,060
able to use me I've around for geek of

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:33,060
