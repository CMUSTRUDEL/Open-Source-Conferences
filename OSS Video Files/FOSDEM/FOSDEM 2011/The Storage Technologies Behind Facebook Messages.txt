Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	By Nicolas Spiegelberg.

The engineering team behind Facebook Messages spent the past year building out a robust, scalable infrastructure. We spent a few weeks setting up a test framework to evaluate clusters of MySQL, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, and a couple of other systems. This talk looks at why we ultimately chose HBase and a number of the infrastructure decisions the team made to handle well over 100 billion messages per month.
