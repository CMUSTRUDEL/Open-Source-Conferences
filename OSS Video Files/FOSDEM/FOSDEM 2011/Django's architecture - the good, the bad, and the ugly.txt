	By Andrew Godwin 

Django has become one of the leading web frameworks over the past few years, and has become well-known in the web industry for both good and bad reasons.

This talk takes a look at the internal architecture of Django, and highlights what we've cleaned up, what we got right from he start, and the dusty corners of the code that still need a bit more work - a never-ending problem in such a large open-source project
