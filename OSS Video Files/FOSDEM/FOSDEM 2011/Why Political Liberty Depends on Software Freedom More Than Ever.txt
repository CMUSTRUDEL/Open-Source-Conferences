Title: Why Political Liberty Depends on Software Freedom More Than Ever
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	By Eben Moglen 


We have come a very long way since the beginning of free software. GNU, Android, Linux, Open Solaris, X, Apache, Perl & other free software have changed & are changing the world.

But events happening now, like the Wikileaks investigation, and technologies of spying and control, like Facebook and iPad, are reminding us just how politically and socially unfree computers can make us if we're not careful. In this talk, I consider where we are now, and where we need to go 


FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

okay

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,840
so it's time for the keynotes and we're

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,619
very honored to have even Moglen here as

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,250
first keynote speaker he's a professor

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:23,070
of law and legal history at Columbia

00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:26,099
University is probably most known for in

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,590
evolve is involvement in the FSF and for

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,539
creating the software freedom Law Center

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,649
he was also heavily involved in the

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:37,559
creation of the GPL version 3 and many

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,750
other things of course and so uh he will

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,180
give a talk here today about why

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,719
political Liberty depends on software

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,840
freedom more than ever even Moglen thank

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,840
you

00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,770
thank you good morning it's a great

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,980
pleasure to be here I want to thank the

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,580
organizers for the miracle that fuss

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,190
them is you all know that only chaos

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:14,040
could create an organization of this

00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:17,100
quality and power and it's an honor for

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,130
me to play a little bit of a role in it

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,100
I know how eager you are to deal with

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,509
technical matters and I'm sorry to start

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,690
with politics first thing in the morning

00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:32,610
but it's urgent

00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,880
you've been watching it all around the

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,869
world the past several weeks haven't you

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,710
it's about how politics actually works

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:48,180
now for people actually seeking freedom

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:53,070
now for people trying to make change in

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:58,850
their world now software is what the

00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:03,780
21st century is made of what steel was

00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:07,229
to the economy of the 20th century what

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,250
steel was to the power of the 20th

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:15,480
century what steel was to the politics

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:18,930
of the 20th century software is now it's

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,990
the crucial building block the component

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,709
out of which everything else is made and

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:31,280
when I speak of everything else I mean

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:36,090
of course freedom as well as tyranny as

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,780
well as business as usual as well as

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:45,360
spying on everybody for free all the

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:48,360
time in other words the very composition

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,739
of social life the way it works or

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:56,160
doesn't work for us the way it works or

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,590
doesn't work for those who own the way

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:05,120
it works or doesn't work for those who

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:05,120
oppress all now depends on software

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:13,730
at the other end of this hastening

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,660
process when we started our little

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,340
conspiracy you and me and everybody else

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,660
you remember how it works right I mean

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:27,350
it's a simple idea make freedom put

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,630
freedom in everything turn freedom on

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,360
right that was how the conspiracy was

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,090
designed that's how the thing is

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,080
supposed to work we did pretty well with

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,570
it and about halfway through stage one

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,950
my different Larry Lessig figured out

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:48,860
what was going on for us and he wrote

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:52,400
his first quite astonishing book code in

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:57,380
which he said that code was going to do

00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:00,230
the work of law in the 21st century that

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,600
was a crucial idea out of which much

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:06,950
else got born including Creative Commons

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,190
and a bunch of other useful things the

00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:13,130
really important point now is that code

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:16,070
does the work of law and the work of the

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:19,669
state and code does the work of

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,940
revolution against the state and code

00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:26,180
does all the work that the state does

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:31,060
trying to retain its power in

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:35,840
revolutionary situations but code also

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:38,060
organizes the people in the street we're

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,310
having enormous demonstration around the

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:44,300
world right now for the power of code in

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,669
both directions the newspapers in the

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,210
United States this past months have been

00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:53,150
full of the buzz around the book called

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:56,419
the net delusion by yogini motors of a

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:59,630
very interesting book taking a more

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:04,280
pessimistic view of the political nature

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:07,340
of the changes in the net mr. Morrow's

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,620
oaf who comes from Belarus and therefore

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,520
has a clear understanding of the

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:17,090
mechanism of 21st century despotism sees

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,820
the ways in which the institutions of

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,690
the net

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,140
increasingly being co-opted by the state

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:31,500
in an effort to limit control or

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:34,290
eliminate freedom and his summary of a

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,820
half decade of policy papers on that

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:42,480
subject in his book is a warning to the

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,800
technological optimists at least he says

00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:50,510
it is about the nature of the net

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,630
delusion that the net brings freedom I

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:57,330
am I guess one of the technological

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:59,340
optimists because I do think the net

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,550
brings freedom I don't think lose the

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,590
waters off is wrong however the wrong

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,690
net brings tyranny and the right net

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,140
brings freedom this is a version of the

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:13,730
reason why I still have the buttons for

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,990
distribution that say Stallman was right

00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,780
the right net brings freedom and the

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:23,370
wrong net brings tyranny because it all

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:25,470
depends on how the code works all right

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,960
so we all know that we've spent a lot of

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,640
time making free software we've spent a

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,860
lot of time putting free software in

00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,210
everything and we have tried to turn

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:39,900
freedom on we have also joined forces

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:42,750
with other elements of the free culture

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,440
world that we helped to bring into

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:54,060
existence I've known Jimmy Wales a long

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:57,900
time and Julian Assange and that changes

00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:01,800
the world Wikipedia and WikiLeaks are

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,960
two sides of the same coin they are the

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,180
two sides of the same coin the third

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,210
side of which is fuzz them it is the

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,880
power of ordinary people to organize to

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,070
change the world

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,710
without having to create hierarchy and

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,870
without having to recapitulate the

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:23,810
structures of power that are being

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,810
challenged by the desire to make freedom

00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:30,900
WikiLeaks was being treated everywhere

00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:36,689
around the world in a semi criminal

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:38,639
fashion at Christmas time and then

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:43,050
events in Tunisia made it a little more

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,900
complicated as it became clear that what

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,839
was being reported on around the world

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,240
as though it were primarily a conspiracy

00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,839
to injure the dignity of the US State

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:58,979
Department or to embarrass the United

00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:01,050
States military was actually really an

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:06,270
attempt to allow people to learn about

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:09,899
their world to learn about how power

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:14,249
really operates and therefore to do

00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:16,979
something about it and what happened in

00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:21,180
Tunisia was I thought an eloquent

00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:23,849
rebuttal to the idea that the WikiLeaks

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,800
end of free culture and free software

00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:33,649
was primarily engaged in destruction

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:36,019
niall ism or I shrink from even

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:41,219
employing the word in this context

00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:44,760
terrorism it was instead freedom which

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,880
is messy complicated potentially

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,120
damaging in the short term but salvation

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:55,800
'el in the long term the medicine for

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:59,069
the human soul it's hard I know because

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,899
most of the time when we're coding it

00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:03,600
doesn't feel like we're doing anything

00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:07,620
that the human soul is directly very

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,399
much involved in to take with full

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:14,130
seriousness the political and spiritual

00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,370
meaning of free software at the present

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,370
hour

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:25,490
but there are a lot of Egyptians whose

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:28,340
freedom now depends upon their ability

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:31,250
to communicate with one another through

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,040
a database owned for profit by a guy in

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:37,990
California who obeys orders from

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:44,060
governments who send orders to disclose

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:47,690
to Facebook we are watching in real-time

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:51,380
the evolution of the kinds of politics

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:55,340
of liberation and freedom in the 21st

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:58,250
century that code can make and we are

00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:01,220
watching in real time the discovery of

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:05,800
the vulnerabilities that arise from the

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,800
bad engineering of the current system

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:14,560
social networking that is the ability to

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:19,940
use freeform methods of communication

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:23,600
from many to many now in an

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:28,700
instantaneous fashion changes the

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:32,150
balance of power in society away from

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:35,720
highly organized vehicles of state

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:42,800
control towards people in their own

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:46,700
lives what has happened in Iran in Egypt

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,510
in Tunisia and what will happen in other

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:52,670
societies over the next few years

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:55,790
demonstrates the enormous political and

00:10:52,670 --> 00:11:00,080
social importance of social networking

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:03,350
but everything we know about technology

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,320
tells us that the current forms of

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,930
social network communication despite

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,370
their enormous current value for

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:17,840
politics are also intensely dangerous to

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:21,380
use they are too centralized they are

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,680
too vulnerable to state retaliation and

00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:28,680
control and the design of their

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:32,100
technology like the design of almost all

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,950
free software technology is motivated

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,640
more by business interests seeking

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:43,140
profit than by technological interest

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,570
seeking freedom as a result of which we

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,930
are watching political movements of

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,450
enormous value capable of transforming

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:56,670
the lives of hundreds of millions of

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:59,279
people resting on a fragile basis like

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:03,120
for example the courage of mr.

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:07,260
Zuckerberg or the willingness of Google

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,640
to resist the state where the state is a

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:18,230
powerful business partner and a part and

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:21,140
a party Google cannot afford to insult

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,310
we are living in a world in which

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,700
real-time information

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,160
crucial to people in the street seeking

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,860
to build their freedom depends on a

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:36,180
commercial micro blogging service in

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:39,420
Northern California which must turn a

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:42,930
profit in order to justify its existence

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:47,190
to the people who design its technology

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:49,290
and which we know is capable of deciding

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,290
overnight all by itself

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:55,230
to donate the entire history of

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:59,339
everything everybody said through it to

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,529
the Library of Congress which means I

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:05,959
suppose that in some other place they

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,959
could make a different style of donation

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:18,820
we need to fix this we need to fix it

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:22,090
quickly we are now behind the curve of

00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:26,770
the movements for freedom that depend on

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:29,620
code and every day that we don't fix the

00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:34,030
problems create advanced over

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:36,370
capitalized social network media to do

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:39,400
the politics of freedom the real

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:44,710
politics of freedom in the street where

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:47,740
the tanks are the more we don't fix this

00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:50,530
the more we are becoming part of the

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:56,080
system which will bring about a tragedy

00:13:50,530 --> 00:14:01,120
soon what has happened in Egypt is

00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:04,270
enormous ly inspiring but the Egyptian

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:09,810
state was late to the attempt to control

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:15,820
the net and not ready to be as

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:20,110
remorseless as it could have been it is

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:22,390
not hard when everybody's just in one

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:26,950
big database controlled by mr.

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:29,740
Zuckerberg to decapitate a revolution by

00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:33,480
sending an order to mr. Zuckerberg that

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,480
he cannot afford to refuse

00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:46,759
we need to think deeply and rapidly and

00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:49,679
to good technological affect about the

00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:55,139
consequences of what we have built and

00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:57,920
what we haven't built yet I've pointed a

00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:00,809
couple of times already - the reason why

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,959
centralized social networking and data

00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:07,709
distribution services should be replaced

00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:10,439
by federated services I was talking

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:13,769
about that intensively last year before

00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:15,869
this recent round of demonstrations in

00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:18,449
the street of the importance of the

00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:20,970
whole thing began and I want to come

00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:24,720
back to the projects I have been

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:29,249
advocating but let me just say here

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,410
again from this other perspective that

00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:33,720
the over centralization of network

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,499
services is a crucial political

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,350
vulnerability friends of ours people

00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:43,470
seeking freedom are going to get

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:48,179
arrested beaten tortured and eventually

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:50,519
killed somewhere on earth because

00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:53,279
they're depending for their political

00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:57,089
survival in their movements for freedom

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,509
on technology we know is built to sell

00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,509
them out

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,710
if we care about freedom as much as we

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,500
do and if we're as bright with

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,660
technology as we are we have to address

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:17,530
that problem we're actually running at a

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:20,590
time because people whose movements we

00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:23,500
care deeply about are already out there

00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,920
in harm's way using stuff that can hurt

00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:31,090
you

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:34,030
I don't want anybody taking life or

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:38,230
death death risks to make freedom some

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:40,000
we're carrying an iPhone because I know

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,280
what that I phone can be doing to him

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,740
without our having any way to control it

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:49,080
stop it help it or even know what's

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:52,210
going on we need to think

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,570
infrastructurally about what we move to

00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:57,460
freedom now and we need to learn the

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:01,600
lessons of what we see happening around

00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:05,530
us in real time one thing that the

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,540
Egyptian situation showed us as we

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:11,140
probably knew after the Iranian

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,800
situation when we watched the forces of

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:17,170
the Iranian state by the

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,420
telecommunications carriers as we

00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:22,959
learned when the Egyptians begin to lean

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:28,090
on Vodafone last week we learn again why

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:30,640
closed networks are so harmful to us why

00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:33,870
the ability to build a kill switch on

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,760
the infrastructure by pressuring the

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:40,060
for-profit communications carriers who

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,690
must have a way of life with government

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:46,870
in order to survive can harm our people

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:51,850
seeking freedom using technology we

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:55,030
understand well now what can we do to

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:59,530
help freedom under circumstances where

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:03,460
the state has decided to try to clamp

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:06,760
the network infrastructure well we can

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,799
go back to mesh networking we've got to

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,990
go back to mesh networking

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,500
we've got to understand how we can

00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,539
provide people using the ordinary

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,360
devices already available to them or

00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:23,990
cheaply available to them to build

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:28,970
networking that resists centralized

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:32,330
control mesh networking in densely

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:35,269
populated urban environments is capable

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:39,470
of sustaining the kind of social action

00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:41,139
we saw in Cairo and in Alexandria this

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:45,169
week

00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:48,860
even without the centralized network

00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:52,490
services providers if people have

00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:55,850
wireless routers that mesh up in their

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:59,450
apartments in their workplaces in the

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:02,600
places of public resort around them they

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:05,929
can continue to communicate despite

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:11,179
attempts in central terms to shut them

00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:14,210
down we need to go back to ensuring

00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:19,850
people secure end-to-end communications

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:23,360
over those local meshes we need to

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:26,299
provide survivable conditions for the

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:30,169
kinds of communications that people now

00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:32,659
depend upon outside the context of

00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:36,620
centralized networking environments that

00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:42,070
can be used to surveil control arrest or

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:44,880
shut them down can we do this

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:49,820
sure

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:53,220
are we going to do this if we don't

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,440
they're the great social promise of the

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,500
free software movement that free

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,600
software can lead to free society will

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:06,840
begin to be broken force will intervene

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:09,780
somewhere soon and a demonstration will

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,660
be offered to humanity that even with

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,630
all that networking technology and all

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,030
those young people seeking to build new

00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:23,540
lives for themselves the state still

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:23,540
wins this must not happen

00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:32,400
if you look at that map of the globe at

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,789
night the one where all the lights are

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,559
and imagine next time you look at it

00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,950
that you're looking instead at a network

00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:44,429
graph instead of an electrical

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:47,370
infrastructure graph you will feel a

00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:50,850
kind of pulsing coming off the North

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:57,750
American continent where all the world's

00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:59,990
data mining is being done think of it

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:03,990
that way all right

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:07,679
North America is becoming the heart of

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:10,470
the global data mining industry its job

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:15,090
is becoming knowing everything about

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:18,380
everybody everywhere when Dwight

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:22,530
Eisenhower was leaving the presidency in

00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:25,409
1960 he made a famous farewell speech to

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,919
the American people in which he warned

00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:32,340
them against the power of the

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:35,760
military-industrial complex a phrase

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,250
that became so commonplace gushin that

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,260
people stopped thinking seriously about

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:46,799
what it meant the general who had run

00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:52,320
the largest military activity of the

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:55,409
20th century the invasion of Europe the

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,669
general who had become the president of

00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:01,980
America at the height of the Cold War

00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:05,250
was warning Americans about the

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:08,240
permanent changes to their society that

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:11,520
would result from the interaction of

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:15,780
industrial capitalism with American

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:19,350
military might and since the time of

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,860
that speech as you all know the United

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:26,570
States has spent on defense more than

00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,570
the rest of the world combined

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:35,260
now in the 21st century which we can

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:40,450
define as after the latter part of

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:42,669
September 2001 the United States began

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,820
to build a new thing

00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:51,700
a surveillance industrial military

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:53,350
complex the washington post produced the

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,539
most important piece of public

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:58,330
journalism in the united states last

00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:02,380
year a series available to you online

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:04,870
called top secret America in which the

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:08,559
Washington Post not only wrote eight

00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:12,130
very useful lengthy analytics stories

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,779
about the classified sector of American

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,659
industrial life built around

00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:19,690
surveillance and data processing the

00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:21,760
post produced an enormous database which

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,059
is publicly available to everyone

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,870
through the newspaper of all the

00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:31,929
classified contractors available to them

00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,909
in public record what they do for the

00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:36,850
government what they're paid and what

00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:39,370
can be known about them a database which

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,500
can be used to create all sorts of

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:44,080
journalism beyond what the post

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,130
published itself I would encourage

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,159
everybody to take a look at top-secret

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:54,880
America what it will show you is how

00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:57,519
many Google's there are under the direct

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,620
control of the United States government

00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,529
as well as how many Google's there are

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:06,519
under the control of Google in other

00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:09,730
words the vast out spreading web which

00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:12,519
joins the traditional post Second World

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:15,760
War us listening to everything

00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:19,990
everywhere on earth outside the United

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,389
States to the newly available listening

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:25,779
to things inside the United States that

00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:29,230
used to be against the law in my country

00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:31,330
as I knew it's law to all the data now

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:34,600

everything you type into search boxes

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,690
about what you believe wish hope fear or

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,390

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,760
as well as every travel reservation you

00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:49,680
make and every piece of tracking data

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,680
coming off your friendly smartphone

00:24:55,909 --> 00:25:02,929
when governments talk about the future

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,819
of the net these days I have on decent

00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:08,449
authority from government officials in

00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:09,799
several countries when governments talk

00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:12,499
about the future of the net these days

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:16,789
they talk almost entirely in terms of

00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:18,739
cyber war a field in which I've never

00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:21,589
had much interest in which has a jargon

00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:23,959
all its own but some current lessons

00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:26,719
from intergovernmental discussions about

00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:34,489
cyber war are probably valuable to us

00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:36,440
here the three most powerful collections

00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:38,539
of states on earth the United States of

00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,989
America the European Union and the

00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:44,539
People's Republic of China discuss cyber

00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:49,069
war at a fairly high Intergovernmental

00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:52,239
level fairly regularly some of the

00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:56,179
people around that table have

00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:59,629
disagreements of policy but there is a

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:02,319
broad area of consensus in the world of

00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:05,709
cyber war they talk about exfiltration

00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:08,779
we would call that spying they mean

00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:12,009
exfiltrating our data off our networks

00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:15,679
into their pockets

00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:17,299
exfiltration I am told by government

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,059
officials here and there and everywhere

00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:22,309
exfiltration is broadly considered by

00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:25,190
all the governments to be a free-fire

00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:27,440
zone everybody may listen to everything

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,329
everywhere all the time we don't believe

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,190
in any governmental limits and the

00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:32,719
reason is every government wants to

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,679
listen and no government believes

00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:38,059
listening can be prevented on that

00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,979
latter point I think they're too

00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:41,959
pessimistic but let's grant them that

00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:44,569
they've spent a lot of money trying and

00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:47,389
they think they know where the

00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:49,459
disagreements currently exist I am told

00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:52,219
by the government officials I talked to

00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:55,819
concerns not exfiltration but what they

00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:59,779
call Network disruption by which they

00:26:55,819 --> 00:27:05,270
mean destroying freedom the basic

00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:08,990
attitude here is of two parties in

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:11,270
balance speech one side in that

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,790
conversation says what we want is clear

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:16,190
rules we want to know what we're allowed

00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,870
to attack what we have to defend and

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,140
what we do with the things that are

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:24,170
neither friendly nor enemy the other

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:27,500
side in that conversation says we

00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:29,030
recognize no distinctions anywhere in

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,070
the net where there is a threat to our

00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,890
national security or our national

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,270
interests we claim the right to disrupt

00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,610
or destroy that threat

00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:42,080
regardless of its geographical location

00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:43,910
I needn't characterize for you which

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,860
among the government's the United States

00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,750
of America the European Union or the

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,660
People's Republic of China take those

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,490
different positions and I should say

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,900
that my guess is that within all those

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,090
governments there are differences of

00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:00,350
opinion on those points dominant

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:02,750
factions and less dominant factions but

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:05,180
all parties are increasingly aware that

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:08,920
in North America is where the data

00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:12,740
mining is and that's either a benefit a

00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:15,590
dubiousness or a problem depending upon

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:19,250
which state or collection of states you

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:23,540
represent European data protection law

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:26,540
has done this much it has put your

00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:29,170
personal data almost exclusively in

00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:31,990
North America where it is uncontrolled

00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:34,990
to that extent European legislation

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,990
succeeded

00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,979
the data mining industries are

00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:43,950
concentrated outside the European Union

00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:47,219
largely for reasons of legal policy they

00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:49,499
operate as any Enterprise tends to

00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:51,450
operate in the part of the world where

00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:56,279
there is least control over their

00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:58,229
behavior there is no prospect that the

00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,509
North American governments particularly

00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:03,509
the government of the United States

00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:05,519
whose national security policy now

00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:08,549
depends on listening and data mining

00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:15,200
everything are going to change that for

00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:15,200
you no possibility no time soon

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,620
when he was a candidate for president at

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,710
the beginning in the Democratic

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:29,080
primaries Barack Obama was in favor of

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,480
not immunizing American

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,210
telecommunications Giants for

00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:37,000
participation in spying domestically

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:40,180
inside the United States without direct

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,590
public legal authorization by the time

00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,950
he was a candidate in the general

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:48,190
election he was no longer in favor of

00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:51,130
preventing immunization indeed he as a

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,530
senator from Illinois L did not

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,490
filibuster the legislation immunizing

00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:58,900
the telecoms giants and it went through

00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,300
as you are aware the Obama

00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,030
administration's policies with respect

00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,220
to data mining surveillance and domestic

00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:09,120
security in the net are hardly different

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,670
from the predecessor administrations

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:20,070
except where they are more aggressive

00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:24,070
about government control we can't depend

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:26,890
upon the pro-freedom bias in the

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:33,250
listening to everybody everywhere about

00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:37,270
everything now going on profit motive

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:39,970
will not produce privacy let alone will

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:42,450
it produce robust defense for freedom in

00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,450
the street

00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:50,700
if we are going to build systems of

00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:52,470
communication for future politics we're

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,610
going to have to build them under the

00:30:52,470 --> 00:31:01,110
assumption that the network is not only

00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:02,790
untrusted but untrustworthy and we're

00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:06,330
going to have to build under the

00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:12,290
assumption that centralized services can

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:15,900
kill you we can't fool around about this

00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:18,840
we can't let Facebook dance up and down

00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:23,340
about their privacy policy that's

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,670
ludicrous we have to replace the things

00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:29,520
that create vulnerability and lure our

00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:33,120
colleagues around the world into using

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,640
them to make freedom only to discover

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,240
that the promise is easily broken by a

00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,240
kill switch

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:47,330
fortunately we actually do know how to

00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,330
engineer ourselves out of this situation

00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:56,790
cheap small low power plug servers are

00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:59,550
the form factor we need and they exist

00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:05,250
everywhere now and they will get very

00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:07,370
cheap very quick very soon a small

00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:11,760
device the size of a cell phone charger

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:16,320
running a low-power chip with a wireless

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:20,610
NIC or two and some other available

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:25,080
ports and some very sweet free software

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:28,500
of our own is a practicable device for

00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:32,910
creating significant personal privacy

00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:36,120
and freedom based communications I think

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:38,690
what it needs to have in it mesh

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,690
networking

00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:46,430
we're not quite there but we should be

00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:48,080
open BTS asterisk yeah we could make

00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:50,510
telephone systems that are self

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,780
constructing out of parts that cost next

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,780
to nothing

00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:03,320
federated rather than centralized

00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:08,300
microblogging social networking photo

00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:13,820
exchange anonymous publication platforms

00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:18,200
based around cloudy web servers we can

00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:21,970
do all of that your data at home in your

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,680
house where they have to come and get it

00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:27,440
facing whatever the legal restrictions

00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:30,320
are comma if any comma in your society

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:35,600
about what goes on inside the precincts

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:39,080
of the home encrypted email just all the

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,020
time perimeter defense for all those

00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,390
wonky windows computers and other bad

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,740
devices that roll over anytime they're

00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,740
pushed that by a 12 year old

00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:56,899
proxy services for climbing over

00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:59,869
national firewalls smart tunneling to

00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:02,239
get around anti neutrality activity by

00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:07,879
upstream ISPs and other network

00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:11,569
providers all of that can be easily done

00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:15,099
on top of stuff we already make and use

00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:18,799
all the time we have general-purpose

00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:20,750
distribution of stacks more than robust

00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:23,720
enough for all of this and a little bit

00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:30,200
of application layer to work to do on

00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:34,149
the top yesterday in the United States

00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:39,139
we formed the freedombox Foundation

00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:41,059
which I plan to use as the temporary or

00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:44,270
long term as the case may be

00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:48,049
organizational headquarters for work

00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:51,710
making free software to run on small

00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:54,710
format server boxes free Hardware

00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:58,190
wherever possible unfree hardware where

00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:01,839
we must in order to make available

00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:04,660
around the world at low prices

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:08,150
appliances human beings will like

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:12,970
interacting with that produce privacy

00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:12,970
and helped to secure robust freedom

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:33,240
we can make such objects cheaper than

00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:36,720
the chargers for smartphones we can give

00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:39,960
people something that they can buy at

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,810
very low cost that will go in their

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,840
houses that will run free software to

00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:50,760
provide them services that make life

00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:52,740
better on the ordinary days and really

00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,780
come into their own on those not so

00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,060
ordinary days when we're out in the

00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,300
street making freedom thank you for

00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,300
calling

00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:10,390
a belarusian theatre troupe that got

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,580
arrested and heavily beaten on after the

00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:17,960
so-called elections in Minsk

00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:21,800
this winter exfiltrate hid itself to new

00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:24,830
york city in january did some

00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,750
performances of palm stop hard and gave

00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:30,320
some interviews I'm sorry of Harold

00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:34,190
Pinter and gave some interviews one of

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,490
the Belarusian actors who was part of

00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:40,460
that troupe said in an interview with

00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:45,160
the New York Times the Belarusian KGB is

00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:49,220
the most honest organization on earth

00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:51,880
after the Soviet Union fell apart they

00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,950
saw no need to change anything they did

00:36:51,880 --> 00:37:00,620
so they saw no need to change their name

00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:06,230
either and we thought that was a really

00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:07,700
quite useful comment we need to keep in

00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,980
mind that they are exactly the same

00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,530
people they always were whether they're

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,950
in Cairo or Moscow or Belarus

00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:18,050
or Los Angeles or Jakarta or anywhere

00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:20,750
else on earth they're exactly the same

00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:23,750
people they always were so are we

00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:26,390
exactly the same people we always were -

00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:29,780
we set out a generation to go to make

00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:33,230
freedom and we're still doing it but we

00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:36,860
have to pick up the pace now we have to

00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:40,070
get more urgent now we have to aim our

00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:44,060
engineering more directly at politics

00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:47,360
now because we have friends in the

00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:51,320
street trying to create human freedom

00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:57,340
and if we don't help them they'll get

00:37:51,320 --> 00:38:02,740
hurt we rise to challenges this is one

00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:02,740
we've got to do it thank you very much

00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:35,869
it thank you very much and I think there

00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:39,400
is enough time for a few questions so

00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:39,400
please raise your hand if you want to

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,319
come in

00:38:53,690 --> 00:39:02,520
I'll repeat the question just wait for

00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:05,130
the microphone it's arriving thank you

00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,260
so the the question was what does

00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:10,980
complete decentralization mean for

00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,690
identity because the state you may

00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,490
believe who you are but the state gives

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,170
you a passport or some other legal

00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:19,049
document that allows you to identify

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:21,690
yourself so in complete decentralization

00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:24,960
how do you identify yourself on that

00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:26,789
network I doubt that complete

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,890
decentralization is the outcome of

00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:31,230
anything but let me tell you a story

00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:35,520
which may help to explain how I feel

00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:38,490
about this we need to go back now by 16

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,559
years to a time when there was a program

00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,119
called PGP and there was a government in

00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,760
the United States that was trying to

00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,619
eradicate it III know this will seem

00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:51,150
like ancient history to many people but

00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:53,579
it's my life so it doesn't to me we were

00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:59,010
having a debate at Harvard Law School in

00:39:53,579 --> 00:40:00,869
January of 1995 two-on-two about PGP and

00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:04,680
the criminal investigation and the

00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:07,500
future of secrecy the debaters on my

00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,140
side were me and Danny white snur then

00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,750
at the Electronic Privacy Information

00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:15,180
Center later at the w3c and now in the

00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,890
United States Department of Commerce and

00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,750
on the other side was the then Deputy

00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:21,359
Attorney General of the United States

00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:25,589
and a former general counsel of the

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,420
National Security Agency we debated PGP

00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:29,010
and their encryption and the Clipper

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,319
Chip and various other now long dead

00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,670
subjects for a couple of hours and then

00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:34,829
we all went off for a friendly little

00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:37,500
dinner at the Harvard faculty Club on

00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:38,910
the way across the Harvard campus the

00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,520
Deputy Attorney General of the United

00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:43,410
States said to me Evan on the basis of

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,270
your public statements this afternoon I

00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:50,010
have enough to order the interception of

00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:52,470
your telephone conversations she thought

00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:55,350
that was a joke

00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:57,630
and the back in 1995 you could sort of

00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:59,160
get away with thinking it was a joke

00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,480
as the deputy erosion of the United

00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:05,430
States because it was so clearly against

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,990
the law well alright so I smiled and we

00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,820
went off and had our dinner and after

00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,800
the plates were cleared and the walnuts

00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:14,550
and the port had been strewn about the

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,110
deputy this former general counsel to

00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,970
the National Security Agency I'm

00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:21,420
concealing names to protect the not so

00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:23,700
innocent here the this former NSA lawyer

00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,380
he looked around a table calmly and with

00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,720
that sort of plum me through the port

00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,700
kind of look and he said okay we'll let

00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,190
our hair down what we we agree we're not

00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,590
going to prosecute your client that PGP

00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:37,560
will happen we've fought along delaying

00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:40,320
action against public key encryption but

00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,210
but but it's coming too and then now and

00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,650
then he looked around the table and he

00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:47,640
said but nobody here cares about

00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:49,590
anonymity do they and a cold chill went

00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,680
up my spine because I knew what the next

00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:54,930
15 years were going to be about so I

00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,880
would like to turn around the thing you

00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,170
said to say what we're really talking

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,160
about is whether there is going to be

00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:04,200
any preservation of anonymity at all

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,050
where power on the other side made its

00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,250
peace in the mid-1990s was with the idea

00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:10,440
that there would be strong encryption

00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:13,140
and e-commerce but there would be no

00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,540
anonymity and in the course of the last

00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,850
decade they picked up a strong alliance

00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,960
with the global entertainment industries

00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:21,690
the things that now call themselves

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,160
content companies which are also adverse

00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,480
to anonymity right because they want to

00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,670
know what you read and listen to and

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,650
watch every single time so that you can

00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:32,640
increase their shareholders wealth for

00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:34,440
them the real problem of identity isn't

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,180
the problem of are we going to be

00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,100
centralized passed the point where we

00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,810
have identity we're not going to do that

00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,090
we're not going to be able to do that

00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:45,540
the real problem of identity is are we

00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:46,950
going to have any of our own or are we

00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,020
going to be the data cloud that

00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:51,330
everybody else is keeping about us which

00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,130
contains where we are what we do what we

00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:56,550
think what we read what we eat and

00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:58,380
everything else do as long as you send

00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:00,210
the subpoena to mr. Zuckerberg who has

00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,870
the one big database in which you live

00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:05,870
your entire life

00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:09,200
I understand the idea that we might be

00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:12,890
thought of or satirically or even

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,810
pointedly claimed to be trying to

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,960
radically decentralize to the point at

00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:19,550
which identity gets lost but if you find

00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,530
yourself in an argument with people

00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,240
telling you you're trying to analyze so

00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:24,380
far that there won't be any name in the

00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,210
passport anymore

00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,830
you can reassure them that meatspace

00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:30,320
will stay pretty much the way it is

00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:33,640
right now we just want fewer people

00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:36,080
ripping fingernails off in meatspace

00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,450
which is why we are busy building

00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,990
freedom boxes and helping people use

00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,150
them

00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:43,160
thank you very much the passport will

00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:46,130
remain pretty much the way it is right

00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,320
now with the RFID chip in it and the

00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:51,290
fingerprints and the retinal scan and

00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,210
everything I'm not worried that we're

00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,040
gonna go too far friends it's the other

00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:57,820
folks who went way too far in our jobs

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,820
to get back home

00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:12,890
Hey all righty bye I'm not controlling

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:16,860
hello I've been I'm here you here

00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:18,510
Jeremie from the lakota gillnet first of

00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,880
all I want to thank you when I will

00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:24,530
never thank you enough for how inspiring

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,530
you are for every one of us

00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:35,670
then by thanking you for inspiring us

00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:38,490
and the engineering perspective as I am

00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:42,420
both an engineering geek and a political

00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:45,030
activist but by what I do I wanted to to

00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,070
stress that the ACTA the

00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:51,210
anti-counterfeiting trade agreement that

00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:54,470
deeply concerned strengthening of drn's

00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:57,270
and the legal protection and also turns

00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:59,850
every internet service provider every

00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:02,370
internet intermediate into private

00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:04,710
copyright police with deep consequence

00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:07,770
on our freedom of speech or privacy

00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:09,750
right to a fair trial and so on the

00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:12,630
actor will be coming to the European

00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:15,030
Parliament around next summer maybe

00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:17,910
before maybe after and it will be or

00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:21,350
you'll team a chance to defeat the thing

00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:24,270
we won in the European Parliament before

00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:27,420
this is a battle we can win and

00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:30,590
everybody here can participate into it

00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:34,530
and I wanted to ask you weapon are those

00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:36,810
legislative fights worth fighting do we

00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,420
still have a chance and especially on

00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:40,980
the front of the net neutrality

00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:44,760
what are your insights what what do you

00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:47,340
think we can still win today no European

00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,000
citizens should need any introduction to

00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:53,190
the Chatham easy member right that's the

00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,080
future of the European Union speaking to

00:45:53,190 --> 00:46:00,600
you your question should we bother

00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,700
fighting in legislature seems to me a

00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:06,660
fair one yeah we should it's unpleasant

00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:09,160
work I worry about you I don't want your

00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:12,420
heart to burst

00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:15,750
I don't want people killing themselves

00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:19,450
over the strain of it it's ugly

00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:23,530
boring tedious work and the other side

00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:27,880
pays people to sit you out to wait until

00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:30,069
you go home to decide you give up think

00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,970
of Egypt as a place where that was what

00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:36,940
was done for 30 years along with torture

00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:38,829
everything stops moving if you read

00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,780
Clark Moore's arrow on the French

00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:43,780
Revolution or the coming of the French

00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:46,359
Revolution as he moves his thousands of

00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:49,539
men and women of freedom towards the

00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:52,299
climactic events of the late 1780s you

00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:54,849
see how deeply the feeling in France at

00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:57,220
the end of the Austrian regime was of

00:46:54,849 --> 00:47:00,760
status beginning to break up into

00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:04,089
movement the work you're talking about

00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:07,480
is work that is largely defensive to

00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:09,609
prevent harm from being done and as you

00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:13,359
say you're lucky when you win after

00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:15,940
enormous effort that nothing happens but

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,829
the good news is in legislative politics

00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,809
that there's a thousand ways to stop a

00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:22,690
thing and only one way for it to get

00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:25,650
done and therefore the side that wants

00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:29,079
to stop things has an inherent advantage

00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:33,940
most of the time that's deeply funded

00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:35,799
capital but sometimes it's us about ACTA

00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,930
I think there is no question it's a

00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:41,349
fight worth fighting everywhere all the

00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:44,619
time because as you say it's really the

00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:47,799
conquer dot the treaty between the state

00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:51,099
and private power for the control of the

00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:53,710
net under 21st century conditions in the

00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:58,809
mingled interests of the listeners and

00:47:53,710 --> 00:48:01,930
the owners if we do beat it water it

00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:05,140
down force withdrawal of particularly

00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:08,890
offensive premises or significantly

00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:12,039
expose it to disinfecting daylight we

00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:14,500
will help ourselves we're not going to

00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:17,099
achieve everything by any means we need

00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:20,200
to turn the international trade

00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:22,240
conversation in the direction of direct

00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,000
support for freedom

00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,730
my line with the trade negotiators

00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,910
around the world has become government's

00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:34,330
have a right to share the sharing

00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:36,849
economy has as much right to support in

00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:40,210
the international trade system as the

00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:43,060
owning economy my colleague mr.

00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:45,339
chaudhary who directs s FLC India was in

00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:48,880
Beijing making a speech on that point

00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:51,580
earlier this year we will be reiterating

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,280
that point in various places around the

00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:57,430
world where strong states with which we

00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:00,310
have other difficulties meet with us in

00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:03,970
recognizing that the world trade system

00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:07,180
is now overwhelmingly tilted in favor of

00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:09,010
ownership based production which is only

00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:13,150
one part of the world's economic

00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:16,540
production we need to press hard against

00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:19,869
ACTA and other Pro ownership trade law

00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:22,320
but we also need to begin to roll out an

00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:25,330
affirmative strategy of our own

00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:28,180
demanding protection for sharing based

00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:31,630
economic activities in the global trade

00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:34,359
system that effort will take 20 years to

00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:38,530
begin to show fruit but we need to begin

00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:42,700
that too now on network neutrality I

00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:46,830
will say this we are going to have to

00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:51,359
establish counter force to the various

00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:54,220
oligopolists of telecommunications the

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,970
regulators believe a lot of things they

00:49:54,220 --> 00:50:01,420
have been told by industry I was at our

00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:04,270
SEP myself in September to discuss

00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:06,540
wireless network neutrality in Paris

00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:10,599
with regulators who are well-educated

00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:13,140
shrewd thoughtful and capable but who

00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:16,750
believes something which isn't true

00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:20,970
namely that it costs enormous monetary

00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:25,330
investments to build wireless networks

00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:29,440
and I said to the are separators do you

00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:31,720
know about open BTS do you know that I

00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,420
can take a coat hanger and a want a

00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,730
laptop and make a GSM cell phone base

00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:41,100
station out of it using some free

00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:43,330
software do you know about asterism I

00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:47,640
suggested that maybe they would like to

00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:51,790
give us a small French city say Grenoble

00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:54,490
we're using the extraordinary high

00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:57,670
quality wired harness that they built

00:50:54,490 --> 00:51:00,010
around the hexagon that is France we

00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:03,490
will create cellphone companies out of

00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:05,500
nowhere using cheap commodity hardware

00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:08,230
and existing handsets and provide

00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,110
service to everybody and then I say it

00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:13,210
will be possible to have a realistic

00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:15,430
fact-based discussion about whether the

00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:18,670
enormous investment necessities of

00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:22,560
wireless network build-out require non

00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:25,030
neutrality in network routing practices

00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:26,740
well the regulator of course nods and

00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:28,300
smiles and thanks me very much for all

00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:31,240
that information and forgets it the

00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:34,180
minute I leave because he still believes

00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:37,150
what are all that used to be France

00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:39,630
Telecom tells him about how you can't

00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:43,480
make wireless networks without immense

00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:45,910
monetary investments we will begin to

00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,859
gain on network neutrality when we have

00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:50,290
a box in everybody's apartment that can

00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:53,920
offer free telephone service over

00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:56,800
tunneling around non neutrality and talk

00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:00,910
to GSM handsets oh that would be the

00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:03,040
freedombox see that's what I want to do

00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,680
I want to build a ring of Engineering

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,220
around the idea of non-neutral network

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,440
management I want to have a box in your

00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,990
house that senses the upstream and says

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,730
oh my God he's stopping port six five

00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:19,450
five I think I'll route that through my

00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:21,150
friend's apartment then I think we will

00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:24,359
get some interesting network neutrality

00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:24,359
conversation going

00:52:29,749 --> 00:52:36,380
you thought when you call for

00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:37,849
decentralization aren't you really going

00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,670
against the trend of history as we've

00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:43,219
seen it for example we used to have

00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:45,199
Usenet which was decentralized but that

00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:51,079
has let's move much more to web-based

00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:55,670
forums or likewise we in victim mail of

00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:56,959
IRC we may go to free node but the

00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:58,729
general public not all know about

00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:02,059
Twitter which is moving into that space

00:52:58,729 --> 00:53:04,069
and I think yeah there are many reasons

00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:06,349
why this could be happening but I think

00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:08,630
the primary reason is perhaps mine share

00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:10,880
the journalists who report this to the

00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,309
general public outside fiefdom know

00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,499
about websites they know about Twitter

00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:21,380
they never knew about Usenet so only

00:53:15,499 --> 00:53:24,650
geeks know about that if we take this

00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:26,660
point perhaps the main share you need to

00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,739
be going for if the journalists who

00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:31,130
report on the net

00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:37,609
get them to report on decentralized

00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:41,959
networks and get the public to start

00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:42,650
using them crucial part of the activity

00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:45,289
that's right

00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:46,579
we're going to talk to people some of

00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:47,509
those people are going to be journalists

00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:48,859
and some of them are gonna be our

00:53:47,509 --> 00:53:50,929
friends and some of them are going to be

00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:52,130
other engineers and some of them are

00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:53,630
gonna be people who when they're

00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,609
wireless router breaks that can go out

00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,170
by freedombox cuz it's cheaper and

00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:59,390
neater and cooler and does more good

00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:02,239
stuff and some of them are going to be

00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:03,859
people gonna buy because they need it we

00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,630
just have to make the software the

00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:07,640
hardware guys will make the hardware and

00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:09,559
everything will happen I don't know how

00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,959
long I don't know with what degree of

00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:13,579
certainty but I don't think it's about

00:54:11,959 --> 00:54:15,140
going against the flow of history I

00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:17,469
think it's about pushing the pendulum

00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,469
back

00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:25,170
the best thing the general public have

00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,250
to know that these options exists and

00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:29,070
will serve their needs

00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:33,540
yes the Apple will always advertise more

00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:35,910
than we will but the general public

00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:38,990
knows about Firefox so they can know

00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:38,990
about the freedombox too

00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:49,029
I think we have to stop in order to

00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:52,049
allow the conference to go on thank you

00:54:49,029 --> 00:54:52,049
very much for your time

00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,020
