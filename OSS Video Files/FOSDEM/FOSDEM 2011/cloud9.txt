thank you nice to be here I'm recurrence

00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:17,440
I'm the CTO of HX a dork

00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,560
and as a check so dork we've been

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,480
working since 2005 on open source you I

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,619
technology in the browser JavaScript UI

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,180
frameworks and that stuff looked

00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:30,070
something like this it's really UI

00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:36,930
framework with trees and buttons and all

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:40,540
that kind of stuff so what we did was in

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,840
beginning of 2010 we pivoted the company

00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,730
and we focused everything on the next

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,170
step in tooling putting the entire

00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:53,260
development environment in the browser

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,330
we're a team of 15 people dedicated

00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:01,600
developers everybody is now working hard

00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:05,280
on cloud nine and ace the editor and to

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,100
show you a little bit so so many tabs

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,070
everything you see from Cloud 9 and the

00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,229
editor you can get from github so HX org

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,770
slash cloud nine it's a local version

00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:20,250
that you can pull in and play with we

00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:24,689
currently support nodejs development so

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,689
that's what you can use it for right now

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,109
the online version is working on now

00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:35,320
we're in closed beta it looks like this

00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:37,960
run cloud nine ide calm and it has a

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,340
very tight get integration you have a

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,950
good project you want to edit it online

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,649
or work on it in your browser you can go

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,039
to this URL put your get URL in the box

00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:51,789
and it'll fork the project to to our

00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:54,130
servers I have two already forked here

00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:55,810
i'm going to show you the no chat demo

00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,359
which is a very basic demo that Ryan

00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,909
made for node and do a little hello

00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:05,909
world here so if you click on on the

00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,909
project it essentially opens up the IDE

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,780
it's very familiar-looking you have a

00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:16,110
file tree on the side code editor

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,450
console menus it looks very much like

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,690
the IDE that you might use or might not

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:25,250
use

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:29,720
and I think one of the most important

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:34,910
parts here is the editor this is a fool

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:39,290
Dom based editor with a really really

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:44,270
good performance so let's see I can open

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:49,180
file here probably I can show you how

00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:52,160
fast it works or just copying some text

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,530
you can see that it can quite readily

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,410
deal with thousands of lines of code in

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,060
your browser this is of course very

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,180
important if you want to have a good

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,780
experience the editor is a separate

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:09,170
component it's called ace it has its own

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:13,070
website as well asa Ajax the dork the

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:15,380
ace project is now the successor of sky

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,750
rider and Bespin and we've joined with

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,960
Mozilla to create coolest and best code

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,930
editor on the web this project is really

00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,720
taking off a lot of people are adding

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:30,080
syntax highlighting debugging all sorts

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,090
of little language tweaks to it or Iraq

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,340
Lee here is doing a vim support so that

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,140
everybody who is used to vim will not

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,440
trip over their fingers and happily use

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,580
it so all that stuff is really cool but

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,550
it's also essential if you're a

00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,450
developer and you want to get the proper

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:50,870
feedback from your ID and have a fast

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:53,480
environment now I'm not sure everybody

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:58,300
here is aware of nodejs no jess is

00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:02,150
actually a very simple concept

00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:06,530
asynchronous i/o based on v8 JavaScript

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:08,840
engine so this is for instance the

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,019
node.js hello world it's very very

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,709
simple it shows you it creates an HTTP

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:18,890
server waits for requests and then throw

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:22,550
us back and message now in cloud nine

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:25,310
you can run and debug node.js code so

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:29,930
I'm now going to start the debug session

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:33,080
on this project as you can see in the

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,160
console we have the console output that

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,750
is running on sir

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,640
so this is a JavaScript process that's

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:43,390
how running on the server and I can open

00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:49,550
the application which says hello world

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:55,490
now let's put a breakpoint here and see

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:59,540
if we can refresh this right so it's not

00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:01,700
refreshing just hit the breakpoint the

00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,130
debugging support in cloud nine

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,290
currently the server side note yes but a

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,220
lot of people are working on Ruby

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:12,340
support looking at Java Python and also

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,110
debugging the browser itself which is

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,140
for Chrome currently fairly easy because

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,880
it has the same debugging protocol as v8

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,370
but for the others there's still a bit

00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,930
of bridge work to do so now I hit a

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:30,560
break point and I can do stuff like I

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,880
can execute in context code just like

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,070
you're used to from if you're using

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,470
visual studio probably here not but you

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,330
can do in context code so here is the

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:45,530
message variable it says hello world I

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:48,500
can assign something hello plus them to

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,620
it alright so now you would actually

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:56,060
expect that if I press play that my

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:59,600
browser here with a chin change state so

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:05,150
this shows that you can debug a node.js

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:09,820
server with full state in cloud nine so

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:15,620
this is only step one great code editor

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:18,530
debugging of node and we've only been in

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,930
beta a couple of weeks I already have

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,930
more than 3,000 people signed up so it's

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,060
going really quickly and there's a lot

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,710
of good feedback coming from the

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,070
community and people adding stuff to

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,140
this ID because this is not you know we

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,970
love to work in it we make cloud nine in

00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,750
in cloud nine but in the end it's a

00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,970
developer tool that should be your own

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,410
it's written in JavaScript so you can

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,660
modify it in JavaScript this is

00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,940
something that is a very basic premise

00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,970
but it's very powerful

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:54,720
for instance I don't have it as an

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:56,970
indigenous demo it's not on it's not in

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,260
cloud nine yet but I've seen that

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:05,610
they've added real-time JavaScript

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:07,860
checking using uglify Jess and narcissus

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,410
running in the background worker so you

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,830
can have as you type nice colored flags

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:21,720
that tell you hey you're missing a well

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:23,820
thank you you're missing you're missing

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,040
semicolons or you know you missing

00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,210
curlies or if you turn on the settings

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,480
too high it will whine about anything

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:33,660
but it helps you type dynamic languages

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,250
dynamic code because these are not

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,200
compiled so your compiler will not

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,460
complain about something missing or

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,650
something being wrong so I think the

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,170
next step for dynamic languages is that

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:46,050
the tooling comes forward and assist you

00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,660
as developers in pointing out errors a

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,800
lot earlier in the development process

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:54,120
so those are things that we're working

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,419
on of course there's the debugger here

00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,510
you can also peek into node itself

00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:03,270
nodejs has almost all of the stack

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,540
written in JavaScript with only a couple

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,700
of hooks in C for the lower level access

00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,110
so as you can see as we end up in here

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,990
in our code there's actually a whole

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:17,280
stack of JavaScript already running in

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:19,110
no chess and the nice thing about the v8

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,850
debug protocol is that you can peer into

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,190
all the code that's running even though

00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,200
these JavaScript files are not even on a

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:32,479
file system they're compiled into no

00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:35,700
Jess itself which is really nice so yeah

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,500
here's her console because it is a get

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,210
project the most basic way of

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:46,110
interacting with get is on a command

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:49,170
line I can now run git commands here on

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:52,440
my workspace actually it's small unix

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,540
process you can just move around but

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,620
this is an essential part of cloud nine

00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,100
as well so you can interact with your

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,290
files

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,500
also a really cool addition from Mozilla

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:09,410
is the command processor which will also

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:11,620
arrive in cloud nine soon and that's

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,110
actually a type based command

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:20,410
autocomplete so if i type git then I'd

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:24,140
get a nice well I can see that see right

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,820
it is not in list but we'll show a very

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,480
nice type system so you can navigate

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:32,030
your commands very quickly I didn't

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:39,770
exactly time this so I think I'm almost

00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:42,770
through so all this stuff is open source

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:45,740
and you can play with it you can apply

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:49,160
for the for the beta on run cloud 9i

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:52,300
calm and play around with it online or

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,040
you can work on the editor component

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:59,180
which is a switch has a different repo

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,790
also here and I invite everybody to join

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:06,700
play with it and see what you want it to

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,700
be and join in the process thank you

00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:19,500
thank you

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,890
