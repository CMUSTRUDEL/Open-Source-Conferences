hello today I'm going to talk to you as

00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,650
he said about rails admin but first a

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,380
little about me I'm a student from

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,480
Romania I'm developer for more geotech

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,039
I've been a student in the Ruby Summer

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,320
of Code of 2010 and the rails admin is

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,900
the project as my project for the Ruby

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,329
summer of code if you have any questions

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,520
feel free to ask at the end of my

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,850
presentation and you can find me of

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,680
course on twitter at at hurricane with

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:47,340
an i so what is the administration every

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,890
web developer sometimes in the past when

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,680
he wrote his first web app thought about

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:57,059
how to do dat administration how to

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,940
manage and control his data so dat

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:04,170
administration differs from web app to

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:08,540
web app but and in the way you organize

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:11,520
your data is and your controller data is

00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:15,119
the way you do data administration so

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,009
you organize your data that's the logic

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,509
of your application and the way you

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,110
control it that is the data

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,390
administration so usually you do this

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,930
via and then min panel so there are a

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,930
lot of types of main panels out there

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:35,759
you can do dat administration in all

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:40,619
sorts of way but how to do it and secure

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,770
in a fast way usually many people write

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,320
their own and main panels so this is a

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,810
little error-prone because you have to

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,270
test it very well it's definitely not

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,750
fast because you have to waste a lot of

00:01:51,270 --> 00:02:02,399
time and it's not always very very

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:04,880
simple other people use CMS's so this is

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,469
usually fast this is usually not fast

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,929
because you have to learn how the CMS

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:13,630
works and everything but it's usually

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:20,020
secure but it's not an

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:24,340
it's flexible somehow also the rails way

00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:28,930
of doing it is using a plug-in or now in

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:33,160
riddles three an engine and this is all

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,410
of three so it's secure because you plug

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,690
in you plug the you know the plug-in

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:41,430
that it's very well written or it has a

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:44,770
lot of tests running on it so it's

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,890
secure it's fast because you just plug

00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:51,220
in the engine and what it works and it's

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,740
also very very simple so introducing the

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:58,450
rails admin you can find the code on

00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:02,140
github at that address as I said it's a

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:05,290
ruby summer with cage 2010 project my

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,530
main mentor was a eric michael Albert's

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,020
Albert so it was very very nice

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,210
collaboration between us also a lot of

00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:17,380
important people from the ruby on rails

00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:19,570
community contributed to to dispatch to

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,900
this project as mentoring and everything

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:27,460
like luda cuts and all the people

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:30,670
mentioned the history of the rails admin

00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,270
is that Eric coded the MER badman that

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:38,020
is a port of the well-known Django admin

00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:43,870
and I had to port murbad went to two

00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:46,690
rails three so the rails admin is in

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:50,230
fact rails engine that is a feature

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:53,190
introduced in rails to and continued

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:57,040
continuing to rattles three so you have

00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:02,140
basic Ruby on Rails application and you

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:06,390
can run that application in a different

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,390
ribbon arias application just

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:13,690
structuring your code a little different

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:16,620
so you have you keep your main logic

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:20,190
with controllers models and views and

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,780
you just namespace your application and

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,300
through many through magic everything

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,460
works so it's very very simple to write

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,490
an engine

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:37,990
this is a controller that is just

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:42,280
namespace and it works also oh you can

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:46,210
do that with the module also and that's

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,340
the basic of rails engines also the

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:52,539
routes that is a pretty important thing

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:56,560
in rails you can also do this and you're

00:04:52,539 --> 00:05:01,199
in your app and everything works out of

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:06,940
magic so it's it's a very nice right

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:09,250
rails engine so real sad min does the

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,729
crud thing very very well it does

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:16,539
automatic form validation of course you

00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:18,970
want to have your data protected by some

00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:21,759
sort of authentication so you we use

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:25,630
device you can do column search history

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:30,430
it's a pretty pretty Oh full option

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:32,889
admin panel so how do you install it you

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:37,060
just write in your gemfile two lines of

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:40,199
code you run a bundle update and after

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,150
right after data just another line of

00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:47,219
generators and that's it you're

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:50,070
administering to your rails app also an

00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:54,310
important feature that is going to be

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:57,520
available in rails 3.1 is mountable apps

00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:01,930
so I have my rails engine that is not

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,080
installed via gem and i only say mount

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:08,409
an application and it all works okay so

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:14,080
i'm going to do a short demo to show you

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:16,380
how um the rumor of the rails admit

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,380
works

00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:34,699
okay so this is my typical web sorry web

00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:34,699
application and I have put the ah sorry

00:06:35,119 --> 00:07:04,369
I don't know if it it's very nice to see

00:06:39,959 --> 00:07:08,699
bad okay okay and if we do okay perfect

00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:11,719
so you just put this two lines of code

00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:17,129
and everything works and you run the

00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:27,649
basic installation so you start the web

00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:37,919
server and it works and in fact sorry

00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:39,599
that's there was there because it's a

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,989
basic rails application does not have

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:47,759
the basic path set out so you run this

00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:50,969
if you have a clean web application

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,269
installed you have drills admin tasks

00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:57,419
asked you for a username and password

00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:59,550
that is done via device and this is how

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:04,439
the main panel looks like i have a

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:10,969
simple post small model and i can view

00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:10,969
multiple columns i can edit a different

00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:18,659
entry and can create a new one also it

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:22,259
maps validations so you if you have one

00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:26,360
too many or many to many of association

00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:29,990
sorry does that or you can put in along

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,050
let's say we do a quick

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,050
a

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:58,060
its present Oh title I think so i put a

00:08:50,110 --> 00:09:02,980
validation there and I hope that I ok so

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:08,470
if I do this it says it could not update

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:11,500
the post because it has a blank title so

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,620
this is the basic rails admin also you

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:19,170
can do searches you can root it you can

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:22,680
select different entries to delete and

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:26,620
you have a history that Israel based so

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,740
every modification to your table is

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:40,540
mapped to the history table so this is

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:43,420
the basics of the rails admin ok so

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,450
we're going to launch the rails admin

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:49,060
one point 0 in a few weeks that's the

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:52,420
main milestone for the rails admin but

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:55,540
if you pull the code from the key to

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,370
avoid Sri its production ready we have a

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,290
lot of tests written so you can run

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:04,750
those tests and see that everything

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:08,380
passes also since I've stopped working

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:11,890
on on the Ruby summer of code in

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:15,340
September we had we have now 1010

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:19,150
hydrant Watchers and github it has been

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:21,760
translated into 12 languages and a

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:24,540
configuration dsl has been written by

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:29,800
the community so a lot of people

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:33,400
contribute to our application and this

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,700
is a sample of the configuration dsl if

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:40,090
you want to hide a modal in your

00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:45,610
application you just do this and the

00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:48,250
model disappears ok so

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:51,670
if you have any questions feel free to

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:54,870
ask there is a lot of debate on our

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:59,519
issue tracker on github because people

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:04,410
don't want a rails admin to use device

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:09,370
because it's normal in some way because

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:11,519
because there every people every web

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:15,790
developer wants to write his own

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:22,029
authentication scheme so it's not very

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:25,630
very used device by the community but we

00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:28,269
use it and the project as the rails

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:33,130
admin has starting to have a lot of

00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:35,200
users permissions we haven't set up some

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:39,640
sort of permission framework for the

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:43,390
application so the user has just one

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:46,930
super the plug-in has one super user

00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:51,370
that does everything the configuration

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:56,130
is being done through the dsl any

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:56,130
questions please

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:15,470
can you repeat the question please no ok

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,690
so he asked that for the rails one point

00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:21,680
a we support polymorphic associations

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:24,320
that's right ok for the moment now but

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,470
if you really need the polymorphic

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,620
associations your fee to fuller request

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,750
and get and do that yourself and we have

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,760
a lot of contributors that are going to

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:40,280
accept your patch as quickly as we can

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:42,140
so we have now seven month since we

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:46,840
started project we're pretty young and

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:51,770
we accept as many contributors as we can

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:53,860
another question no ok thank you very

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,860
