good morning everybody when you add use

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:17,130
one of the editors we are here to talk

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,260
about Android video streaming you know

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,100
it's not a good conversion name but well

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,350
let's try to think about it we are

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,720
talking about Android you know the

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,060
operating the operating system mobile

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,969
phone developed by google in the

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,780
community video streaming we thought

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:40,800
that maybe everyone with mobile in its

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,200
pocket could be a journalist you know in

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,520
each corner of every street they could

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,890
send video to anyone who wants to see it

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,160
and that's a good idea maybe that's the

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,770
future with gaap mad well we are talking

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,949
about Android devices video prosumers

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,190
that's why i said we want the people we

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,670
want people to send what'd they say what

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,470
what they see what the what they'll look

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:12,510
Justin to all around the world on all

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:15,659
the skeletons and this slide I thought I

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:20,460
could use a good parent index but that's

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,500
a good example of nada index I'm going

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,990
to move from past to future of this

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:30,680
prior and talking about the present all

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,229
this started with a very short

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,570
development team just software developer

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,750
and me and I'm a telecommunication

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,750
engineer and we thought about this this

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,960
requirement the people maybe could send

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,479
what they what they see two to internet

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,590
and maybe they could send to their

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,409
friends and who knows to to whom i'm

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,430
working in a chai iberia it's an

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,350
enterprise from spain and we have

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:06,259
developed this this product because

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,259
we've got a client who paid for it so

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:14,210
we have a enough time to develop it and

00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:17,330
that's why we move into into this this

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:20,210
process we are a company who is working

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,090
with ICT companies banking public

00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,160
administration public bodies and R&D

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,650
research and development we are in

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,510
seventh framework programme national

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:34,270
programs regular programs not this kind

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:38,150
of things that's of an enterprise since

00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:40,870
20 years ago we have doing things about

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,890
technology consultancy consultancy

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,440
maintenance of our quality development

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,750
and nowadays we are working hard in

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,830
open-source products and research and

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:56,090
development as I said which is the

00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:58,190
project Orion we were working in a plug

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,989
public project of multiple City Council

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:06,470
in the area in the arts area and they

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:08,840
were they were thinking about using the

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,090
visitors not just saw in to the visitor

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,519
what they have made they have thought

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:17,000
you know they need feedback from the

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,890
visitors so there is an cultural

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,810
institution metadata the Madrid I don't

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,900
know you know Madrid well if you go

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,390
let's see it they need interaction with

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,880
the visitors so they thought they need

00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,390
three columns three pillars they need a

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:36,530
wireless infrastructure because they the

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:38,440
people who goes the needs a wireless

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,380
infrastructure to con it with the world

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,380
they need be the streaming because they

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:49,160
think that maybe all the all the things

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:52,880
that visitors see or think could be

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,400
interesting for anyone duo and we have

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,530
developed a semantic search product just

00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,900
for the archive they have you know they

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,489
they have events they have presentations

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,940
and they have all this kind of video

00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:08,000
things so they want the people could

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,980
find the things quite easy and what's

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,459
the duration of eight month and what's

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,980
completely open source so we've got

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:20,209
about the beta streaming thing a simple

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:23,930
idea it's a it's about Mayan

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:26,509
we r sin the new car we want to buy we

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,380
want to send it to do our to a friend

00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:32,780
and so we've got our mobile that's the

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,970
one i have samsung galaxy s I don't have

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:40,270
stock options in this company but it's a

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:43,789
good mobile phone you could buy it and

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,400
well then send you to capture you record

00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:48,349
the video and you take it in front in

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,410
your mobile phone but you send it to a

00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:53,990
transcoding server and we use the

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:58,160
well-known transcoding application with

00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:00,979
God you know FF impaired and we use god

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,669
I can think on journeys free container

00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:07,009
you know uh fiora Barbies or we got of

00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:11,509
all all the things we've got about Steve

00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:14,060
doc argh so we transcode the day stream

00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:17,090
and we send it to a streaming server we

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,370
use ice custom we use October to send it

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,460
to upload the content to the Australian

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,039
server and if we've got it over there we

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:29,570
can consume it in in the laptop with

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,460
using firefox html5 we else here mplayer

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:35,690
everything we want that's the simple

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,849
idea of their character what then which

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:41,360
technologies we are using well we have

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:45,130
tested in and Android devices 1.6 2.1

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,080
2.2 we use TCP as a transport protocol

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,810
because we do we are doing buffering you

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,000
know and we have no problem about the

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,580
feedback the recent protocol and all

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,590
this kind of thing tcp have but it's

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,449
quite easy for us to send from the

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,060
mobile two days to transporting server

00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:04,250
using TCP we were thinking about our

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:09,080
teepee the teepee on one but we prefer

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:13,520
to use it now we have to convert we

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,979
record the final with the video and the

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,889
audio in a d in different streams I tell

00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:21,620
you later why but well we've got the

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:24,349
container mp4 and the idea with pulse

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:28,150
code modulation PCM in different streams

00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:31,099
and we convert it in with with this

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,720
codex on containers ah and theor for the

00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:36,320
BDM Barbies for the for the idea

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:40,220
we just the transcoding application with

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,470
God FM ampere and ice castle as a

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,920
streaming server and up for what you

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:48,050
send it to upload the content to the to

00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,390
this to the server to strain server we

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,810
just java programming language we love

00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:59,390
out of memory errors so that's why we

00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:02,780
use it and only because we've got a

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:05,450
previous product and we reuse it and we

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,180
just celebrate script into to control

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:11,000
the process of the pipes we used to

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,120
connect Evan pair with Oxford where with

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,700
I cast with your site scripting and the

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:22,820
end user side we could use whatever we

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:26,270
want VLC and player or html5 in a inside

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,940
the Firefox or the browser technical

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,220
details as I said we've got two

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:35,570
different recording threats because if

00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:38,090
we will record them all together we have

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:40,910
problems to send it to the transcoding

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,840
server because we don't have the all the

00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:46,370
headers that the container format have &

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,400
Wesson it we don't have time stamps we

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:52,280
don't have all the things we know we

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,310
need to you know which kind of bites our

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,729
video which kind of bites are audio so

00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,950
we record them separately and we send it

00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:04,400
several it in two different threads and

00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:09,530
busting server we makes them we just

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,930
control port with an XML guide data to

00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:15,560
include the major debt information like

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:18,440
like the author the title of whatever

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,750
the user wants to include and with San

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,600
will respond with the lesson port with

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,090
an ass i said with an the video and the

00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,180
audion different ports we using TCP and

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:32,450
the information which is well-known

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:35,270
transcoding technologies so there's no

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,580
problem about that with it's quite good

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,880
well good test it and there's no point

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,669
about that and the problem here is the

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,930
the audio delay we are its control

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,960
because we are using our own

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,899
time stamps with a fine which kind of

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,560
delight we've got in the record threat

00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,899
and that's why we put in the in the the

00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,020
transcoding server to mix the LD on the

00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:03,209
video and we are using pipes you can add

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,570
the the application where we are using

00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:11,220
ffmpeg or fog well another scan we have

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:15,330
developed and a version of cat called my

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:18,810
cat because we'd really needed to to

00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,640
construct to construct a a stream of a

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,520
bit rate than a constant bit rate of

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,860
bytes and if we reduce cat we are maybe

00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,020
having problems about broken pipe and

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,660
all its kind of things and we already

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,200
develop a little application called chop

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,480
pages we are trying to put in inside fmm

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,330
pair we are talking with them the

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,490
developers and then that's the only the

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:46,890
only thing this application is doing is

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:51,420
to to making pages of our container just

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:54,180
a few little few short because is they

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:58,920
are quite big we have problems with the

00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:01,110
ice custard here we have some

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,880
screenshots of the application you know

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,279
they are known in Spanish because its

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,230
foreign Spanish institution but the

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,020
violence is quite simple you know if you

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,300
have already worked with Android it's

00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,839
quite easy to define with an XML all

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:19,550
these kind of things and we have we have

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:24,000
here to define the configuration of the

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:28,020
server the metadata the vision of the

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,529
camera you know it's quite simple I

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:36,540
thought we could I could do for you a

00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:40,920
life Dima but I didn't know if I could

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:43,850
have Wi-Fi or and I don't have a 3g

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:48,899
connection or roaming connection so I

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:51,839
beg you for trust me I don't know if you

00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:55,380
trust and get like the American do it

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,450
well please in Fernando with trust if

00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,930
you go to Madrid maybe you could go to

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,089
Matt other I don't know

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:04,120
you have ever been the and you can see

00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:05,830
it working over there they are trained

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,720
then when they have an event on maybe

00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,670
the the visitors could they have had

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,050
they have all day all the change you

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,140
know they have the streaming server and

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,540
the transcoding server putting in their

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,430
machines and you could send it they

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,880
define they have posters you could send

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:26,950
your your video to this direction and

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:29,500
you could use it just cases which

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,959
operations more than the instruction the

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,440
cultural institutions we are thinking

00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,240
that maybe everyone could be a

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,970
journalist in each corner of average

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,930
rate we could be recording what we are

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,790
seeing and maybe there's someone in the

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,430
other path at the other part of the

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:52,029
world that maybe could be interesting at

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:55,660
that and maybe for example in in Harriet

00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:58,600
nowadays why not the Egyptian people

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,990
could send what they have what they are

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,820
seen to to the rest of the world you

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,790
know so everyone could be a good

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,330
journalist another another just cases

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:13,839
could be for example the if we want to

00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:16,600
see our our children at the school and

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,690
we are they are playing football so

00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,480
maybe we want to descend this and it's

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:26,140
for this football match to to our family

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:31,500
or anyone so maybe it could be another

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:34,420
good application I'd have thought about

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:38,800
children playing football so I use this

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:42,850
one and I know that was the best moment

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:46,600
of my life last year so another good

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:51,070
application could be oh sorry I don't

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,920
know what happened adult content that's

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,350
that's not a yoke I was talking to to

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,440
adultcon the provider and he thought

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,980
that if anyone in in their house could

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,779
send what they want to to record join

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,140
other people that's a very good

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:10,180
interesting thing Justin I suppose you

00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,340
know Russian Roulette I think it's

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,130
called

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:18,570
but the webcam that it's changing in a

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:21,060
random circle you know maybe that's good

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:24,290
be a good sample of what we can do with

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,060
Android bitter streaming in the future

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:30,210
well we don't know who knows the future

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:34,890
but it's that's why open source license

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:39,020
so maybe you could so you could do

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:42,510
things about this development you can

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:45,780
give up support maybe we are we are

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:48,540
trying to decide to which forge we move

00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:51,330
the the gold but of course it's

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,810
completely open source because it's on

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:57,510
the it's on the contract and we are we

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:00,840
notice about the the open source is the

00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,790
is the best way to develop and if you

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,550
want to contribute or maybe if you want

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,080
to to have you have good ideas about

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,300
this product or about the future of

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,630
video streaming maybe you could contact

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,650
me or or do good and you can enter to

00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:18,510
the to our web back to our website and

00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:23,010
good opinion and good see what we have

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:28,070
done ok so that's all and if you have

00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,070
questions so maybe it's just two minutes

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:38,370
ok why you need transcoding because

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:41,430
we've got if you you see the IPI of

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,980
Android we don't we don't need to we

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:48,240
don't have the possibility to too bright

00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:50,580
with using free codex you know we cannot

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,490
a trend we got me kind of the record

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,710
with a Barbie Cynthia we wanted to use

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:59,130
them because where we wanted to use a

00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:01,110
free free streaming server I scuss than

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:06,240
we wanted to eat so we had to use our

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:08,160
bodies and fear we thought about we have

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,430
to without about a put inside the

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,200
Android the libraries of a diverse is

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:17,790
what's quite easier to use to send the

00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,670
sundeck codec such as in the stream as

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,670
the mobile record you know

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,890
