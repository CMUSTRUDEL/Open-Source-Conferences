Title: devops More than Marketing
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	By James Turnbull 


DevOps is a new concept that has emerged in the Development and Operations community. It calls for closer relations between developers and operations people with a view toward improving the quality of the services we provide.

I'll introduce the tenants of DevOps:

    * Simplicity
    * Relationships
    * Process, automation, tooling
    * Continuous improvement

I'll also focus on automation and tooling and especially some of the more interesting open source projects (and people!) that make DevOps possible: configuration management tools, monitoring, metrics management and visualisation.

Finally, I'll cover some of the critiques, criticisms and FUD throw at DevOps and why the concepts are more than just marketing.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

thank you very much

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,320
good afternoon thank so much for coming

00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,460
along it's a very very big room it's a

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,610
lot bigger room that I'm used to

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,680
speaking in it's not up a little bit

00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,170
about me I've been involved in the open

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,460
source community for about 20 years now

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,960
since I was a teenager and discovered

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,600
this Linux thing was a bit cooler than

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,430
that Windows thing I work at puppet labs

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,860
I run the operations and professional

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,739
services group there I'm an author I've

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,540
written five technical books mostly

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,079
about linux he said been an open source

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,590
set of things I'm a big geek my wife

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,329
would say very much a big geek I'm known

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,670
to buy every single gadget that appears

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,699
on the market I usually buy two of them

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,320
and break them fairly quickly I should

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,149
warn you I do talk funny i'm from

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,469
australia where and pretty much every

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,470
every other part of the english-speaking

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,659
world doesn't believe we speak english

00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,400
so if you find anything you can't

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,890
understand or I find that I'm talking

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,090
very quickly wave your hands frantically

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:18,659
in the air and go please slow down okay

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:21,360
not a good sign i'm also a whinging

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,720
bastard I've spent a lot of years in

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,990
operations working in in some big shops

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,719
and I'm well known for for complaining

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,460
about things I don't like things that

00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,590
are broken I'm a firm believer in

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,299
perfection I don't think you can achieve

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,500
perfection but you can get a bloody well

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:44,159
of a long way towards it so what's

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:48,360
DevOps all about this is a topic that

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,619
comes up a fair bit you know and I don't

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,170
think there's a clear answer to it yet

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,640
so DevOps is about cooperation for me

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,969
cooperation between development teams

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,680
and operations teams and particularly

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,359
important is to why Belgium is so

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,039
important for DevOps is because a

00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,560
gentleman who coined the phrase DevOps

00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,439
Patrick Dubois is obviously from Belgium

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,350
and Chris and I'm going to stop his

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,000
surname up they are also heavily

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,160
involved in the original DevOps movement

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
so the pretty much the original DevOps

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,460
sort of thinking emerged out of a bunch

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,170
of people in Belgium sitting around I

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,640
think drinking beer which may have

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,050
something to do with it well they felt

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,800
the sort of love for one another

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,060
and generally the the whole I guess the

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,560
whole movement emerged had a sort of a

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,680
bunch of Northern European see said

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,780
means so what comes up when you start

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,510
look at DevOps so I did a little bit of

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,420
a key word cloud and I'm afraid that the

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,160
big top bits cut off their the summer

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,020
that the phrases that come up when you

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,380
look at various blog posts around DevOps

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,480
and I look at these sort of things that

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,700
I go will know what does this become is

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,070
this some kind of buzzword bingo where

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,480
you know after after a few after a few

00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,980
phrases you'll all get sit around

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,230
together and go we could talk about

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,390
DevOps and cooperation and ITIL and we

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,460
can talk about you know cross-functional

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,200
teams and then ever somebody can sort of

00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,700
sit in their meeting and go bingo you

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,620
know we've managed to parrot out all of

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,460
the appropriate corporate phrases and

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,380
phraseology is it a pop culture movement

00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,210
are we a bunch of fly-by-night guys who

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,280
are just trying to con you into buying

00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,020
something I've seen a couple of products

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,390
so far that claim their DevOps compliant

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,150
I'm not sure who they were certified by

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,900
but if they buy me beer I'm happy to or

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,930
bourbon even better I I don't think

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,959
we're a pop culture movement I also

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:37,090
don't think that where we're going away

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,709
in a hurry and I but I do have some

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:44,380
caveats before I talk a bit further so

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,630
it's very early days so DevOps is

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,550
probably about two years old in terms of

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,230
in terms of it's sort of thinking and

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,570
it's probably only about six months old

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,090
in terms of people actually sort of I

00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,500
guess more theory sort of theoretically

00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,680
considering all of the possibilities

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,380
that DevOps implies so largely speaking

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,630
the the first conversations about DevOps

00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,880
happened about two years ago I think

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,680
last year they had a DevOps dinner at

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,260
foss Tim and I believe there was about

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,520
10 or 15 people there last night they

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,330
had the same thing again and there were

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,040
60 people so it's a it's early days no

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,510
one has all the answers I don't think

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,880
anyone suggesting that it's a fixed

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,820
movement we sit there and have a

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,050
manifesto or a style guide that says you

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,760
know this is how you recognize its

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,380
DevOps it's painted green and it's got

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,750
little stripes that that's not the case

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,400
nothing's fixed in stone we're certainly

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,370
not I'm certainly not advocating a

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,320
position that are you know that there's

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,800
some sort of doctrinal approach that we

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,270
need to take and at the moment for me

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,280
this is all about outreach it's trying

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,170
to get a message about out about what

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,320
DevOps is and about the community around

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,910
DevOps and you know you noticed a little

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,080
footer on my thing all opinions my own

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,730
may be subject to change without at

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,530
alcohol I think a lot of the dell ops

00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,720
movement has has been about discussion

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,610
about people going well DevOps is a bit

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,320
of this it's a bit of that and you know

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:08,990
let's see let's see how this all fits

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:11,440
together for me I like lists and DevOps

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,540
for me is about is about four things

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,950
simplicity relationships process and

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,010
continuous improvement and I'm going to

00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,840
talk a little bit about each of those

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,980
areas and why they're sort of important

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,150
to me and why I think they're an

00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,640
important part of the ops and why I

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,840
think that makes them up to useful to

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,660
both operations and development

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,250
communities firstly simplicity so we all

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:39,200
work in you know if you work with IT

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,550
then I T is complex you know the simple

00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,280
things some of the simple things you

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,960
know that in an IT shop you know that

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,400
how you build your application stack

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,200
what particular operating system you

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,730
choose can cause a massive amount of

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,250
debate i'm not even going to talk about

00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,660
things like if i sat down and see if you

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,980
vm is the best editor in the world that

00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,050
all the air max people would be stoning

00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,360
me and it's not an uncommon phenomenon

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,820
in the IT world to have hugely complex

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,440
applications linked together based on

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,130
choices that you have to inherit from

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,390
somewhere legacy applications and in

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,400
order to manage those environments

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,050
simplicity is the key so you need to

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,810
choose things that are simple and easy

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,730
to manage those things need to be

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,550
repeatable and reusable it's

00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,900
particularly particularly in

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,180
environments where managing thousands of

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,470
hosts you cannot do something that is a

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,750
one-off thing anymore you can no longer

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,310
get away with saying all about my

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,870
systems are unique snowflakes and

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,120
they're all the all different and they

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,620
need different set of rules you simply

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,270
do not have the bandwidth all the time

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,770
to manage a thousand systems that you

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,190
are considering to be your next life

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:42,140
lakes and simplicity implies easy to

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,669
communicate whatever message you need to

00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,860
communicate about systems whether it be

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,139
there

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,210
state whether it be their configuration

00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,099
whether it be you know how to recover

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,330
them or back them up or secure them you

00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:54,900
need to do something that's simple and

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:57,449
easy to communicate the the key for me

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,650
around this is that if you're sitting in

00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,849
if you're sitting in the end at the end

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,099
of the day we're seeing a room full of

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:04,349
people doing a trying to fix a bug or

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,699
doing an outage you want to have the

00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:08,159
best possible conversation with somebody

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,229
where the end result is that you solve

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:11,520
the problem as fast as possible and you

00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,319
solve the problem in such a way that it

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,849
never reappeared again and if your

00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,590
environment isn't simple and repeatable

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:19,259
then you're going to have a lot of

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:24,599
struggle with that the next things for

00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:26,250
me is relationships so we all were all

00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,689
work in an industry that's well known

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,330
for the fact that we're sort of I

00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:32,099
supposedly misanthropic with supposedly

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,810
this bus that operated from hell types

00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,729
which this had been types and we're the

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,349
ones you pick up the phone and call them

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:39,389
in you go they're going to blame me for

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,800
breaking something or the dev team is

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,500
going to actually know he's going to cry

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,509
out and say here's the guys that you

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,830
know they can't install our latest

00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:48,629
version of the application and they hate

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,900
us and you know we caused them all their

00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:54,029
problems but every single thing that we

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,270
do in the IT world is built is built

00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:59,279
around a relationship with other people

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,979
too many of the the conversations I've

00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:05,129
had over the years in IT have consisted

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:07,440
of you know what I like to call the

00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,599
blame storm so the blame storm is is

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,219
where instead of ascertaining what the

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,199
actual problem is the first thing you do

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,210
is work out who can I blame for the

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,529
problem and who can I make sure how can

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,289
I make sure it's not my fault and

00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:21,779
there's a famous American phrase cover

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:23,580
your ass and that's that's an expression

00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,520
that gets quite a used use quite a lot

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,839
in enterprise IT jobs is your attending

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,370
attempting to rather than solve the

00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,060
problem you're attempting to be the

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,740
person that that is not at fault the

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,039
only way to change that mentality to

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,110
change that conflict between teams is to

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,339
build relationships and there's a

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,779
there's a lot of there's a lot of

00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,860
reading you can do about how to build

00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,529
relationships and a lot of its

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,790
touchy-feely stuff and I now work in

00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,680
America where everyone talks about their

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,949
feelings all the time I'm Australian we

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,899
don't we just get drunk and hit things

00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:56,000
but but generally speaking it's about

00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,340
engagement

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,960
it's about engaging early and often so

00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,270
if you imagine the life cycle of a

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,940
project life cycle peau de loup consists

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,470
of you know if you work in a business in

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,620
the businesses we would like to build a

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,570
product or a service and that product or

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,340
service is going to it's going to talk

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,020
to a new bunch of customers and the

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,460
marketing team you know come up with a

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,140
marketing message and they come up with

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,150
the business comes up with all the

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,890
things they want to do they throw over a

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,290
sort of you know maybe a few scratchings

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,360
on a cocktail napkin that the marketing

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,250
guys came up with between strippers and

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,170
and then handed over to a bunch of

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,610
developers and the developers go we

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,160
can't build this it's impossible that's

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,020
the first reaction almost every time

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,180
they next go okay we can build this but

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,250
it's going to look a bit like this they

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,210
then build the application you know that

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,440
there's a whole bunch of people sitting

00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,360
around and they go this is really cool

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,060
we should use react hear that no SQL

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,620
stuffs really cool and then someone says

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,030
I well we better make sure that it runs

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,790
on this and we better make sure it runs

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,230
on the latest version of Ruby and my god

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,390
we can use this really cool library i

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,250
found and let's install these gems and

00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,870
vendor them in here and and all of a

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,280
sudden and i'm not i'm picking on ruby

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,720
people because i am a ruby person but

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,120
I'm it's true of almost every

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,250
environment the next step that happens

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,960
is that is it the team you know puts

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,040
together this amazing demo and they demo

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,440
it for marketing people the marketing

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,940
people say we hate it they hire a couple

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,770
of you I people and fix that and then

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,630
the application people say we're done

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,940
hand her over let's toss it over the

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,470
fence and the people are handed over to

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,500
operations people the operations people

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,910
take one look at it and go oh my god how

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,440
are we going to make this work it

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,790
doesn't run on our standard operating

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,430
system or requires all these live which

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,290
we don't have how do we back it up oh my

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,940
god it's it's syncing data between three

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,730
data centers across four continents and

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,960
and how do we secure it the application

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,490
architecture is completely different

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,800
from our existing application

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,600
architecture and they model through they

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,160
spend six weeks trying to work out all

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,650
of the bits and pieces they jury-rigged

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,690
things they write scripts they build

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,370
systems that you know it is a special

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,620
unique systems this dick application

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,320
they run it up first day goes under some

00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,940
lawyer and it falls over there's then

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,500
you know we've all sat in that meeting

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,240
where them systems fallen over you know

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,560
that there's 10,000 concurrent

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,820
connections in the developer side should

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,650
support 10,000 concurrent connections

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,160
you guys haven't provisioned enough

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,579
systems you guys haven't worked out

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,259
had a handle this problem and everybody

00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:15,089
sits around and they and basically it's

00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:17,220
an exercise in trying to ascertain whose

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:19,680
fault it was rather hat fixing the

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,600
problem and trying to ascertain how do

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,139
we get how do we get here and how do we

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,670
get out of the hole the key to getting

00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,870
out of that hole is instead of right

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,310
back at the very start where the

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,569
business has a particular need the

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,490
business says we want to create

00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:34,259
something the people they should have

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,970
gone up a conversation with are both

00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,199
developers and operations and if those

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,850
people are in the same room having that

00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:40,470
conversation then all of these little

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,540
things which are called in I to old

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,980
non-functional requirements so

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,990
non-functional requirements little

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,920
things like security and backing things

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:51,240
up and they're equally is an ironic Lee

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,160
called a non-functional but equally is

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,819
important to the process of building an

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,410
application so both if we start from the

00:11:56,819 --> 00:12:00,360
beginning where both sides actually have

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,060
a conversation actually get involved and

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,319
talk to one another then we actually

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,990
have an opportunity to develop

00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:09,060
applications and products where

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,189
everybody gets something at gets what

00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,740
they want out of it so how do we do that

00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:15,930
to start to start to do that both sides

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,490
need to have they taunt and my French

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,699
accent is terrible it sounds much better

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,290
when you actually have a French accent

00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:24,089
but date on is about both sides need to

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,740
understand that they're all in the same

00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,209
problem we're all the same problem space

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,319
we all have the same issues we have to

00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:33,569
deal with we all have the same the same

00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:35,329
bosses the customers we all work for the

00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:39,060
same people we all get paid the same way

00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:41,160
we need to actually get stuck into a

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,079
conversation for another where we

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:48,240
actually don't let out our prejudices

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:49,889
sort of color the conversation and you

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,529
have to have that conversation you can't

00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:55,259
send someone an email that I find the

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:57,000
the classic example of you know someone

00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:58,259
who's wrong on the internet and the

00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,430
reason someone is usually wrong on the

00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,559
Internet is because someone has written

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,689
an email and someone else has read the

00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,610
email and going wow I interpret it like

00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:06,809
this or I speak English as a Second

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,670
Language and I've read this email in a

00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:09,990
particular way well I missed the smiley

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,579
face you suck at the end of that and

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,339
next thing you know somebody's having a

00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:16,259
conversation that consists of of we're

00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,310
actually aggressively pursuing a point

00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:23,050
rather than actually having a

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:24,490
dialogue and I can't underestimate you

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,080
the number of times that I've solved

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,790
simple problems by getting off my ass

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,140
walking halfway across the room or

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,570
getting onto a video conference and

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,950
actually talking to the person involved

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,200
and building those relationships is a

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,580
key part of of any of the of any of the

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,250
steps that that we need to talk about

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:45,640
own DevOps so the next important thing

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:48,640
for me is process so I've spent I spent

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,990
about watching the IT industry changed

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,360
dramatically over the last set of 20

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,740
years when I first started the one

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,600
system we worked on was a massive big

00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,800
mainframe partitioned into a sort of you

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,860
know production and development there

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,990
was a DRP mainframe and there was pretty

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,480
much you know we had a system and it did

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,040
stuff there was no client server there

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,790
was no they were dumb terminals I

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,170
started I cut my teeth on 34 34 70 green

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,350
screens that you can so many green

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,240
screens that's changed dramatically we

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,100
went from a world where all of a sudden

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,660
client-server appeared we had you would

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,920
no longer manage in one big system

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,380
you're managing thousands of small

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,780
systems throw in virtualization throw in

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,570
the cloud if you if you're happy with

00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,430
the term the cloud and all of a sudden

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,230
individual seaside means have gone from

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,120
saying a 1 250 relationship with

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,860
machines to a 125 thousand relationship

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,560
with the machines that's simply not

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,980
scalable I don't know how many hours how

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,330
many hours people spend doing sis admin

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,370
stuff back in the day but certainly

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,930
these days you literally I don't know as

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,760
you said Ben who isn't overworked I

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,670
don't know as you said to me in a big

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,500
shop who isn't constantly looking at new

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,560
technologies constantly having to look

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,450
at at new challenges new products and

00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,920
having to deal with projects in it you

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,839
know far more projects and that they

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,900
used to handling the only way to handle

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,330
letters or automate I cannot under it I

00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,130
cannot under emphasize the importance of

00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,089
automation you're the only way you're

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,709
going to scale up to those three

00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:14,110
environments is is to actually manage to

00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:16,959
all the things that you do should be

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,760
done at the click of a button the other

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,959
thing is is built-in redundancy and the

00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:25,089
expectation of failure for me that the

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,470
classic example of this is is that the

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,390
business comes along and they say we

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,120
would want we want 99.9

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,800
availability and it needs to be

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,270
redundant across all of our data centers

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,400
and if anything goes wrong it needs to

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,580
be up within an hour that's whatever our

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,590
SLA happens to be and then they say you

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,150
know we want this magnificent rolls of

00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:46,150
our solution but here's a budget that

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,890
far as your Morris Minor and that's a

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,110
that's something that we all have to

00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,000
deal with so my assumption is that

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,610
instead of starting from the position of

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,170
let's build the best faucets build the

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,670
most wonderful architecture in the world

00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,710
that build the thing let's make the

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,690
assumption that let's do it from a

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,450
concept of this is going to fail at some

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,940
point so have the expectation of build

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,140
around build your process in your tools

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,220
around the assumption that things are

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,610
going to fail and you need to build

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:14,530
redundancy around them the kit Nick's

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:18,280
the key part of doing that is to test

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:21,130
things so don't don't do your your your

00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,170
testing at the last moment of your

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,430
operation assume that that that's not

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,250
any point in time you should go to pull

00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,980
the plug and say this is this is this is

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,570
broken this is gone what's happened how

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,960
do i how do i resolve this problem so

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:38,590
the next the key part of that is

00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,090
understanding that that if this is an

00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,770
innovative state how did it get there

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,320
and how do i reverse it so you have the

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,910
processes and the automation to say if

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,680
it fails this will this will

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,860
automatically make it heal it make it

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,010
better again the other thing too is that

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,230
remember that processes is processing

00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,790
and the various processes and steps in

00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,920
across both teams both development

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,010
operations is all part of the same life

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,170
cycle so all part of the experience of

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,790
of running an IT environment it's not

00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,720
the signal so if the development team is

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,949
doing testing in their development

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,310
environment if they're if they're

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:14,260
deploying applications then the overall

00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,790
overall it's part of an overall life

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,770
cycle that ends with that application

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,940
going to production so any process do

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,260
you build should be something that

00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:25,630
should be transparent and open to

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:28,000
everybody the key around that is tooling

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,190
and this is where the open source

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,750
community has really come to the fore in

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,940
the DevOps sort of scene and the reason

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,710
that is so prevalent in the debt in open

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,900
source community isn't there are tools

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,110
like puppet and CF engine and chef in

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,390
the

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:44,590
vibration management space control tier

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:47,110
run deck and collective monitoring tools

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,120
security testing a number of people i

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,490
think believe Lindsay homeward who came

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,250
up with them cucumber Negros talked to

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:56,679
you last year about that these are all

00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,990
perceived as ops tools and the reason

00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,510
that that that i put the option ? is

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,190
that the value you get from having that

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,160
having these tools is not limited to

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,080
operations teams development teams have

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,730
a key stake in in building these tools

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,530
and and and the important part for

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,830
example that we we cite as an example of

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,780
why use puppet is that if an application

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,790
developer can build a puppet manifest or

00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,220
a chef cookbook or a CF engine recipe

00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,260
and they can actually deliver that that

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,120
recipe from from life cycle that sense

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,400
they've cut their code they've built

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,980
their associated puppet module or their

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,419
chef cookbook and it ships all the way

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,710
through the life cycles so it gets it

00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:34,660
gets the application development team

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,919
hand that over to a testing team of hand

00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,169
that over to a production operations

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,600
team who actually implement that live

00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:42,669
and it means that you actually have that

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,110
that cooperation have those things like

00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:45,370
you know we are building the

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,540
infrastructure we're building this is

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,190
how the dns looks this is how the

00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,669
backups work this how you secure things

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,080
all the way through that lifecycle

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:55,179
deployment and orchestration you know

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,980
application teams particularly of

00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:00,299
example big java shops there's a very

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,679
very clear way they like to deploy

00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:04,450
deploy and orchestrate applications

00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,580
there's an important opportunity for

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,900
developers and operations people to work

00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,299
together with those tools and actually

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,679
understand what the particular

00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:13,360
requirements the development team has

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,280
and what it requires the operation teper

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,230
have and why those are important the

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,700
other thing is things like monitoring

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,190
and testing is they're not they're not

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,740
solely limited to two one group or

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,880
another so the sort of data that you

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,980
make available your monitoring

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,360
environment is a key piece of data that

00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,400
most of your application developers need

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,600
to understand and troubleshoot problems

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,100
so if you actually go and ask them

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,080
questions about what they want to

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,490
monitor what do they want to see the end

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,210
result is something that you both work

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,210
with in both use

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:52,530
so issues me the other piece of this is

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,700
the lots of things developers do that a

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,750
useful to operations people so smart sis

00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,180
that means for a long time have been

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,960
version controlling things you know

00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,180
everything ranging from dns

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,130
configurations to to whatever it happens

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,190
to be that changes state you want to

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,420
keep track of the last couple of years

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,970
you've seen lots of more operations

00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,610
people understand tools like get and and

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,260
bizarre and the reason they've done that

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,900
is because there's some useful things

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,760
developers do about branching about the

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,679
way that you can actually actually have

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,210
multiple people collaborate on tools and

00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,160
will collaborate on configuration and

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,440
collaboration on code that's useful to

00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,330
both operations people following it from

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,050
that there's also tool things like agile

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,460
and XP and and concepts like continuous

00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,840
deployment that have emerged out of the

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,400
development community that are useful

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,120
things for operations people to know as

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,679
well that's not to say that those those

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,210
concepts are perfect not to say those

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,490
concepts are things that you should

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,100
immediately adopt the new operations

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:53,070
team john all spa from who was it

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,160
flicker and is now at etsy talks about a

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,990
number times about how at i have like

00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,179
used to deploy into production ten times

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,460
a day now a lot of people look at that

00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:04,290
and go those web Ops guys are

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,550
nuts there's no way you're stable

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,200
environment it's going to is going to be

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,510
healthy if you deployed 10 times a day

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,280
into that environment that may not suit

00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,530
your your your particular environment

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,150
but the ability to say go from having a

00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,350
six-week deployment cycle and there's a

00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,429
number of banks and financial

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,710
institutions and insurance companies

00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:21,720
that literally go weeks and weeks

00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,760
between deployments because they the

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,910
processes of deploying an application is

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:31,080
so complex so risky and has such a

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:32,790
potential to to cause disaster that that

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,590
day they're incredibly cautious and risk

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,510
averse there's a lot of concepts that

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,920
come out of that agile and continuous

00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,770
deployment things that can be adopted to

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,360
cut down that time period from

00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,070
application architecture and

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,130
orchestration operations people are

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:50,190
classically bad at documentation i think

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,540
the the you know that the the only time

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,770
the network diagram tends to be up to

00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,860
date is usually after the postmortem

00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,870
for a first for an outage there's a lot

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,430
to be said for for the way applications

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,530
people build architecture the way that

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,500
they are they document architecture the

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,060
operations people can learn a lot from

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,800
another thing is testing methodology so

00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,180
operations people this is something that

00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,490
that's new to a lot of operations people

00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,810
a concept of for most operations people

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,810
the concept of testing things is

00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:20,470
monitoring so is there is the smtp port

00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:22,960
open that is the dns service running now

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,240
can-can I know what's the load on this

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,500
particular machine applications people

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,150
think about testing in a whole different

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,300
way they think about testing in terms of

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,760
is the application functional does that

00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,710
does the result that I input you know at

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,100
run through this method and output does

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,170
that result means something and a lot of

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,910
what summer like Lindsey homework has to

00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,340
say for example about cucumber negros is

00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,410
about understanding that that testing

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,810
things like is the smpte service running

00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,180
is not that important and the reason

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,650
it's not important is because it doesn't

00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,030
tell you anything about the functioning

00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,470
of the application doesn't tell you

00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,350
anything about what the business value

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,000
of that application does the smtp court

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,710
can be open but if it's not sending

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,630
email and that email is not shaped the

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,190
right way whatever letters marketing

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,040
blast that oracle are sending out to

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:11,800
everybody if it's not shaped that way

00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:13,300
then the service is valueless so you

00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,160
need to take your testing up to another

00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,530
layer which is tested business

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,970
functionality so from from an Operations

00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,920
perspective you can learn the lesson

00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,650
lessons that application developers have

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,480
which is that you test the function and

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,160
you return the result that you expect

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,590
the customer to see and in the process

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,360
of testing that function in order to you

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,460
know send a message via thatís input wow

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,050
the SN people has to be open so you

00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,700
actually get all of the base level

00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,990
reporting and I'm not saying you

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,760
certainly turn off the monitoring but

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,770
all the base level reporting you get

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,350
that as well we also get to understand

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,730
that what the customer is expecting to

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:50,710
see what the application is supposed to

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:52,060
deliver actually gets to live it now the

00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:56,950
last piece I talked about is is

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:58,810
continuous improvement so in the IT

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,850
industry before we all have customers

00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,950
the business is our customer

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,020
the doesn't matter what's an

00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:07,210
organization working you have somebody

00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:10,720
who consumes the result of what you

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:13,990
produce those people don't stop asking

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,970
for things you know the the when I first

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,260
started out it as a sysadmin you know I

00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,490
think we fixed a couple of problems and

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,620
I was really chuffed I was really

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,300
pleased no I fixed this problem it's

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,500
awesome you know the customers have been

00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,730
complaining for months that this thing

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,220
didn't do what they thought it was doing

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,930
it was generating a report and they

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,730
wanted the report by you know 730 the

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,900
morning instead of eight o'clock and i

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,090
was really chuffed i did a bit of

00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,610
fiddling around and I know the report

00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,890
generated tweaked some SQL in the report

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,570
generated much faster and I SAT back in

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,590
a way i can have a cup of coffee and a

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,470
cigarette you know I've done a really

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,810
good job and I about nine o'clock i got

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:49,050
an email going yeah we got the report it

00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:51,190
looks like this but now we want it at

00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:53,230
seven because we've actually ascertained

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,670
that that you know it would be really

00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,380
useful if this particular operations

00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:59,140
team in this time zone had it and I'm

00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,640
like you guys where's my thanks

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,440
where's my you know you did a really

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,320
good job now where's my pat on the back

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,000
it never comes because customers never

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,130
happy with the end result they want the

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,350
next best thing and fair enough to

00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:14,620
because they pay your salary they and

00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:16,780
you work for them and I get a lot of got

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,340
a lot of stick for this because I'm a

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,810
firm believer in saying that we all

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,460
deliver a service and the people that

00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,860
pay for that service entitled to get a

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,870
decent service out of us obviously if

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:29,260
they pay like crap then that's whole

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,760
different thing but but those customers

00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,620
don't stand still they have requirements

00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,290
that keep changing kid that you cannot

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,850
sit back and go wow we've done something

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,620
really cool here that's the last time we

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,000
have to worry about this because they

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,260
will come back next week and say well

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,140
you deliver be this I'd like a little

00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:46,780
piece more products don't stands to

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,060
leave that so businesses change you know

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,380
the organization's like banks and I

00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,880
spent a lot of time working banks twenty

00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,490
years ago the concept of online banking

00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,280
completely non-existent now nowadays ask

00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:59,290
most customers to say you know right

00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,580
with exception notable exception of the

00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,560
United States writing a check is a

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,170
foreign concept to most banking

00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,700
customers as a result things become far

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,320
more complex they don't stand still and

00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,740
you need to keep on top of delivering

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,200
things that I knew that are changed and

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,820
that

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,220
that that have unexpected sets of

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,870
requirements technology doesn't

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,870
definitely doesn't stand still either

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,789
you you have things like virtualization

00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,679
of comic come for a rude shock for a lot

00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,779
of shops you know sis admins have gone

00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,370
from saying you know we can manage the

00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:31,220
50 systems like this to managing that

00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,649
5000 system model and your team doesn't

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,630
stand still either people get bored and

00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:37,549
there's nothing worse than it then a

00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,679
bunch of people who are who are bored

00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:40,850
and disinterested by their jobs if you

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,440
provide people with the right set of

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:45,470
challenges the right sort of sort of

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,299
things to learn then then you can you

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,659
move forward quite rapidly and you're

00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:52,399
able to if you're able to improve on

00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:54,289
things move forward and look at things

00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:59,840
in that sort of continuous improvement

00:26:54,289 --> 00:27:01,460
light then it then it's a it's an

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,399
opportunity for both people to learn and

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,500
had people to develop the strike often

00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:08,870
strike hard and be aggressive is that

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,190
you can't sit still in an environment

00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,169
like this you can't sit still wait for

00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,610
things to happen to you so that the

00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:15,500
continuous improvement piece needs to be

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,850
you know think about what would go wrong

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,169
here think about the failure you're

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,630
trying to resolve think about the issues

00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:22,669
you need to deal with and deal with

00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,639
those first the more problems you solve

00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:27,409
upfront the more time you spend putting

00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:29,809
into making things better is the letter

00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:31,610
is that and my boss lukinhas has a

00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:34,039
phrase the faster you get to the pub and

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,139
I'm a firm believer that if you if you

00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:38,960
if you address things aggressively and

00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:40,730
quickly and and actually think about the

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,120
problems first you're able to get to the

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:46,820
pub much faster the big thing about

00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,769
about DevOps for me is that it's a

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,870
cultural change it's not it's not a

00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:54,380
series of technologies and tools and

00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:56,360
processes alone and Kadre change is hard

00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,460
people don't like thinking about things

00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,370
differently they don't like looking at

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,500
things in a new way the not invented

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:07,039
here syndrome is is very strong in a lot

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,809
of organizations people hate change it

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,399
even little changes people don't like

00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:12,710
little changes in their life we like

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,980
routine we like things to be normal we

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,480
like things to be consistent and as a

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,700
result when you make change people don't

00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,260
like you so I've worked in a lot of

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,680
environments where we're introducing

00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,140
changes like DevOps where we know that

00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,790
that the coordination between teams the

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,680
the the first thing that comes out is

00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,240
that why do I have to talk to him that's

00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,620
the guy that wrote that code that really

00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,720
sucked an ayah but woke up at four

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:38,740
o'clock in the morning with a pager and

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,360
as a result you know people will respond

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,520
to you in a fairly aggressive way when

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,890
you make changes like that that fear of

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,530
change is largely irrational it's

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,360
largely a you know I don't know where

00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,590
this is leading I'm largely I'm going to

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,330
be concerned about I'm concerned about

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:55,180
my future where this is leading what

00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,890
happens to me the best way to deal with

00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,540
that fear of change is to listen to

00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,800
people actually have a conversation with

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,540
them about what's what they're worried

00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,340
about what's going on provide concrete

00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:07,120
examples of how things help how things

00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:09,640
change I think the the classic example

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,410
for a lot of people is is is presenting

00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,630
to them this is that this solution will

00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,460
actually result in improved availability

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,320
will result in a better at better SLA

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,180
actually demonstrate how the change of

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,290
work of them other thing is you can't

00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:24,400
just stand up and say make

00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:25,570
pronouncements so as a you have to

00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,100
actually be in the guts of things act

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,930
act to be solving problems actually part

00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,740
of the problem part of the solution

00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:34,810
rather than a problem the worst thing in

00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,480
the world for for any I tea shop but you

00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,160
know that the classic example is the is

00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,230
the development team who don't get woken

00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,000
up before clock in the morning who are

00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,410
who are able to come in you know ten

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,210
o'clock or whatever happens to be and

00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,800
and they get that they'd see the ticket

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,570
they go you know something's broken oh

00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,610
well whereas development team have been

00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,840
awake for last fight the operation team

00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,080
of the wakeful us five hours trying to

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,400
resolve that issue if you wanted to make

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,710
things like cultural change in essence

00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,120
of space give developers pages make them

00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,500
on call make them responsible for

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,190
service levels and availability that

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:09,550
they won't otherwise be so I also wanted

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:13,960
to talk a little bit about some of the

00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:15,850
responses to the DevOps movement and I'm

00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,120
very fond of the classic danger Will

00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:22,090
Robinson with Robby the Robot talking

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,140
about talking about what some whatever

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,140
unknown dangers around

00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:31,080
it's also my favorite thomas paine coat

00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,160
when we were planning for posterity we

00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,370
ought to remember that virtue is not

00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,690
hereditary so when i first started out

00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,270
in the IT industry the guys who taught

00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,740
me about IT ops were all in their 50s

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,620
that all come from that mainframe world

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,730
they were very serious guys who are like

00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:47,910
availability is the key big iron is the

00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:50,460
only way to do it and the virtues they

00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:52,670
taught have not passed on there's a lot

00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,020
of people who come from coming to the

00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,790
operations and development world with it

00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,100
with a very very different perception of

00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:03,020
how our availability how operations

00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:06,410
works you need to actually actually

00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:08,520
provide that that concrete that concrete

00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,740
set of planning in order for people to

00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,890
to continue to understand can you

00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,990
understand what's important so some of

00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,970
the classic responses to dev ops that

00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,900
I've been is good systems Syd mins have

00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,050
been doing this since they came down

00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,000
from the trees and for me this is really

00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,400
this is really something that that I

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,720
look at in fear leader horror there was

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,670
this very small percentage of the

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,440
sysadmin community and our development

00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,750
community who look at this stuff and go

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,180
we've always done this and those people

00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,620
sort of go shrug as a result of that I'm

00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,450
not going to make any changes outside of

00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,610
my world so the other part that they

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,960
completely ignore that eighty-five

00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,340
percent of the community that has no

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,260
idea that there a better way of doing

00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:49,020
things no idea to or that automation

00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,370
will make you free that that that there

00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,010
are ways of different ways of looking at

00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:55,050
things the next response is that that

00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,360
you know my organization is different

00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:59,310
that can't work here and that as I said

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,410
earlier that whole unique snowflake

00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,940
world that's gone there's no there's no

00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,860
way that you can look at an environment

00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,970
and say we're going to manage everything

00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,540
differently we're going to be different

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:12,210
from everyone else that that that that

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,980
thinking is something that that will

00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,360
become you know that comes from that

00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,370
whole bus that operated from hell view

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,900
of the world and that that that's no

00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,720
longer something that's feasible in a

00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,070
modern environment the next one is all

00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,320
about one particular group or the other

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:29,220
so I concentrate on operations that's

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,520
the area that I work in and the response

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,690
here is that that operations people are

00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,970
going to have to become like developers

00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,100
to develop it we're espousing that

00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:39,630
development methodology is is is the key

00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,870
for the way forward

00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:45,930
and for me that's that's that's that's

00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:47,310
simply simply not true the thing for us

00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,170
is that when both sides need to learn

00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,580
from one another so for us for me it's

00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:52,770
understanding that both sides need to

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,440
actually collaborate both sides and it

00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,910
can learn from one another and yes

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,920
someone actually posted your a bunch of

00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,570
elitist European wankers which I was a

00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:05,730
bit horrified by because I'd love an EU

00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:08,990
passport and only have one so the other

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:13,350
danger is that that we're devops ends up

00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:14,670
and for me that as i said earlier

00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,140
there's there's been a couple of

00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:19,020
products that have said they devops

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,970
certified that the new the new hotness

00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,760
is DevOps and therefore we know my

00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:25,530
product does devops i've also seen

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,080
Forrester and garden I both have DevOps

00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:29,310
events I know speaking to Patrick and

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,020
Kristen either of them were invited to

00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,780
that and it's always fascinating with

00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,100
analysts some of you may understand the

00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,480
analyst market is very soft serving down

00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,100
the analysts get a question from

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,420
customers saying I've heard about this

00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,470
develops things what's it all about and

00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,930
they all go around ask all the questions

00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,950
of their other customers and their feed

00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,810
the result back and it becomes a

00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:48,120
self-fulfilling loop the key thing for

00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:51,420
me is that around around DevOps and

00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,650
understanding how how how to avoid that

00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,270
for DevOps is to make it more than

00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,230
marketing speak so actually put these

00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,270
things stuff in practice in

00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,370
organizations to actually solve problems

00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,990
using DevOps concepts to solve problems

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,540
by actually making operations and

00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:05,070
develop work better together other thing

00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,230
is it's very easy to pay lip service to

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,850
this it's very easy to say we're going

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,770
to have a role called a DevOps person or

00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,270
gonna have a dev ops team it's not a

00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,790
role it's not it's not a thing you can

00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:18,080
build a team around it's about different

00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:18,080
way of looking at IT and IT operations

00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,379
it's also a concept that's very easy to

00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:25,139
cause disenchantment amongst people

00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:26,460
mostly because people are uncertain

00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:29,399
about those changes that are uncertain

00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,020
about how the world will will change for

00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,820
them in that sort of dopes environment

00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,379
it's very easy for people to lose faith

00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,210
in the organization that they work for

00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:38,520
because they don't feel that they're

00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,620
going to get anything out of this and

00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,990
that whole disenfranchisement of people

00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,389
is something that that I think every

00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:47,970
organization struggles with and it's

00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:49,470
something that that I think DevOps has a

00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:51,690
real opportunity to change that that

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:52,639
frustrated mentality is a lot of CCC

00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,289
means having the frustrate

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,079
mentalities a lot of developers have

00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:59,690
dealing with Isis admins and that that

00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:01,670
changes around is around that whole

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,230
learning understanding from each other

00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:07,549
and understanding what's what's what's

00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:08,869
going on I've found the last few years

00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:10,819
that I spend a lot of time cutting code

00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:12,319
where I didn't used to I used to spend a

00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:13,940
lot of time writing writing baskets I

00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,829
now find myself cutting Ruby code

00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,240
learning things learning new things and

00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:18,650
I get a lot of a lot more pleasure out

00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,900
of my role and he did previously and

00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,250
last one anti-business diluent Arianism

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,369
I just wanted to put in cuz I'll I can't

00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:27,380
it is just a limit arianism so I think

00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:30,619
I've spoken very quickly and I think

00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:33,019
rather poorly unfortunately but I did

00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:39,010
want to ask if anyone had any questions

00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:39,010
before we go on okay

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,359
when you when you look at the role of

00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,340
development and operations in your

00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,650
environments what are some of the

00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:02,670
tangible things that change about their

00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:04,230
roles like i like i know for agile

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,599
principles for example i mean things

00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,340
like between agile and testing tend to

00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,460
blur the lines what about in dev ops

00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,990
does it change the relay how'd it does

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,220
it change them the activities as a blow

00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:18,500
some of the lines between development

00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,640
and operations so I think classically

00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,020
the whole I think configuration

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,510
management the prime example there so

00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,390
that the we used to spend a lot of time

00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:29,670
doing things like creating users

00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:31,980
installing packages managing services

00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:36,000
monitoring things those are not cool

00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:38,070
things those are boring tasks the thing

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,780
about that the DevOps allows you to say

00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,460
let's take all that stuff let's make it

00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,410
automated let's make it something that

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,520
we don't have to worry about because the

00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,440
really cool thing I'd like to do is

00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,140
learning how to scale this particular

00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,790
application or I'd like to learn how how

00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,369
the new no sequel stuff that the

00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:55,140
developers have introduced works I think

00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:57,000
the tangible outcome for for a lot of

00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,859
organizations is that you get away with

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,160
with saying that all the boring the

00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:04,290
stuff that has occupied your time fixing

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,119
things installing things change changing

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,970
basic configuration things that are just

00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,960
filled instead of boring and monotonous

00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,180
you can actually work on the projects

00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,339
that are actually interesting the other

00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:16,230
thing is that being for a lot of

00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:17,760
organizations having that conversation

00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,140
with development teams means that you're

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,760
actually in the guts of the development

00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,619
process that's part for me is a far more

00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,720
interesting activity than sitting around

00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:26,670
being an operator and watching watching

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,230
the you know that the the meat is and

00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,180
run it if you run a whole bunch of

00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,220
people through through and for example

00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,420
look that we have I have a couple of

00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,920
organizations we work for that have

00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,020
invaded operations people into the

00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,270
developers scrum right they can't

00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,440
necessarily cut the same code but that

00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,400
part of the actual develop the

00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,200
application while the time the

00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,150
application gets to production those

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,830
guys like this is really cool and they

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,810
become evangelists for the for the

00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:50,520
applications developed not only do they

00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,440
they understand the application better

00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,210
and they understand the metrics and the

00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,950
basic concept the developers put into

00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,220
the thing but they actually care about

00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,690
it and I think that's a really important

00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,359
I've seen too many applications to get

00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,400
thrown over the Fen

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,499
you go I don't really understand what

00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,579
this does you know I don't understand

00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:08,980
why it breaks all the time I don't

00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:10,059
understand why performs like but if

00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,559
you actually involved from day one you

00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:13,660
can go well then we made a compromise

00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:15,339
here we actually decided to do it while

00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,049
it like this instead of this because of

00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:18,430
this particular reason and you know we

00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:20,289
can make a better like this is this but

00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,849
here's that the cabinet's we had I think

00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:24,249
a lot of that sort of knowledge is not

00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:25,420
you know that sort of that so knowledge

00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:31,660
is not something that gets passed on

00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:33,489
otherwise when will your a big and

00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:38,589
explicit book about puppet will be

00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:40,809
finished finally so I'm Heasley

00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:43,180
jet-lagged and I'm that that time that

00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:48,519
question has been asked 17 times and the

00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:52,210
since I landed on Belgian soil march or

00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:54,160
april may be no unfortunately yeah I i

00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,309
think i spent about 20 hour days the

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,890
moment and it's almost done almost two

00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:01,210
chapters left and i had to help a very

00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,630
good colleague who is so pushing along

00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,630
so

00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:19,280
hello obviously one of the keys behind

00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,260
the verbs is a better collaboration

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,290
between the development and the IT

00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,810
operations guys coming from the idea

00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:29,750
operations field yourself what would you

00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:32,600
expect from a development team in order

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:35,690
for you to relate better to it what

00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:38,870
would the developers do to ease your way

00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:41,390
towards this collaboration so I talked

00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:43,280
about invading operations people in the

00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,930
scrum land or until you can ban or

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,330
whatever we're developers do do it the

00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:50,420
other way around as well so drag

00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:52,130
development people into into incidents

00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,320
and outages we know if you have an

00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,090
operation stand up drag the developers

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,670
in make them understand the sort of

00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:00,860
problems you have a lot of developers

00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:02,360
are operate on the principle that we've

00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,710
built something that's really cool it's

00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,540
really hot and then we piss off down the

00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,280
pub and the operations people have to

00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,990
manage it if they actually understand

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,570
that the there are implications and

00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,860
consequences to their choices that they

00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:15,110
choose a particular application

00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,690
architecture is going to it's going to

00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:19,400
have an impact on the operations team at

00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,780
the end of the day the number of

00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,960
developers I have a conversation with

00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:26,120
who go oh oh you didn't tell us that

00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,860
that that you you know you don't do

00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,540
things like this or it's hard to package

00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,820
this or we this set of Java libraries

00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,890
like this if you actually have teams

00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,480
involved on both sides from day one of a

00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,230
project there's a far greater

00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:42,170
appreciation for for how that works

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:44,750
developers also stuff like the

00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,190
developers are like you have a

00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,960
particular operations problem we spend

00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,670
to be fairly metric centric people

00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,840
operations people we're interested in

00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:53,270
metrics we interested in measuring

00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,230
things developers are also interesting

00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,520
that sort of thing and they also have a

00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,630
set of things they'd like to know when

00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,170
something goes wrong something's

00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,700
performance falling badly they have that

00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,960
that desire for that information if you

00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,820
have a conversation with the developer

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,770
that says let me tell you about the

00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,150
metrics I have you can tell me about how

00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,530
your application is instrumented and

00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,910
then I can tell you how I what I'd like

00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,990
to have added to that instrumentation

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,970
you can tell me what data you'd like

00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,740
from my end those sort of conversations

00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:18,410
are really powerful and I found that a

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,650
lot of um a lot of developers are sort

00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:23,540
of stunned by the by the i guess the

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:25,550
depth to which operations people use

00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:28,030
metrics and and and they're sort of

00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:30,170
under appreciated our perception of that

00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,850
so that this I guess there's some

00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,260
there's some conversations around that

00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,910
that happens that are really healthy and

00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:40,520
it promote promote that sort of

00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:42,830
cooperation so this sounds really

00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,870
interesting and it sounds like what we

00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,960
did actually what I've done actually in

00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:49,760
some of the companies have worked and

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,070
it's it work so do i but does it first

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,250
does this really scale at all so does it

00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:56,960
scale to bigger team and the bigger

00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:59,450
teams of operations and development

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,890
people because that's one of the main

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,270
problems when the teens become big

00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:06,260
enough it's really hard for them to

00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:08,720
mango and the other thing is mostly if

00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,720
you've done this but I have this very

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,390
work observation that development people

00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:18,230
think for example that CPU memory and

00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:20,450
hard drives are infinite and most of the

00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:23,480
resources are infinite and this is one

00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:25,270
of the main issues with working with the

00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,650
point deploying their software so if you

00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:31,730
manage to teach anyone that that's not

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:35,000
exactly right now I think the challenge

00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:36,530
and and you said I certainly you can see

00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,120
a lot of pushback around DevOps in the

00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:40,010
fact that it works best in in small

00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,300
teams example you know people say it's

00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,470
much easier to do this if you haven't

00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,020
got your not an enterprise and you

00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:46,490
haven't got 500 people I think that's

00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,410
it's true you it's easy to have

00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:52,160
relationships and small teams I think

00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:53,450
the larger teams you do things like you

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,430
move whole groups of people through

00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,900
through through different teams and

00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:59,180
different eyes ations you shuffle people

00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,770
around you keep you keep people actually

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,390
actually learning new things you don't

00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,920
you know its silo things I think that

00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,660
the key mistake people make is you build

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,180
silos you build a group of people who

00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,380
are all the Java developers and you

00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,510
build another group of people that are

00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,060
all of the web ops people and then to

00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,040
build another to that that is it and not

00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,230
only an unhealthy way of building teams

00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,520
but it's a way that doesn't promote that

00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,520
sort of cooperation in coordination

00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:31,060
his counsel of his class

00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:40,000
hi have a quick question over here when

00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:42,010
would be the exact perfect time to

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,570
really start doing devops when you're

00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,890
doing a start-up when you're doing a

00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,150
beginning of a start-up being founded

00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:50,620
yourself you don't have that much

00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:52,540
capital I can't see why for example of a

00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,160
whole bunch of things are useful but the

00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,290
whole configuration management and all

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,030
that might just be a drag in the

00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:00,490
beginning but you really need to move

00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:03,370
quickly quickly forward in order to get

00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:05,140
capital and first clients and Angel and

00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:08,740
whatever so how would you approach that

00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:10,270
one so I think I think green fields

00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,770
green fields is far easier so if you

00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:13,780
have a green fields environment it's far

00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:15,250
easy to introduce new concepts people

00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,570
don't have that it's not invented here

00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,610
or we've always done it this way

00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,980
mentality in a green field sort of

00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:23,170
environment I think though there are

00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,060
real advantages to look at something

00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:28,960
like Davis DevOps in legacy environments

00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:30,760
so legacy environments you know we've

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,160
all got them we've all got you know lots

00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,450
of organizations have have you know that

00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,620
their collection of rail for machines

00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:37,210
that have been living there forever and

00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,580
they can't change or upgrade them

00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:41,110
they're bunch of windows NT machines

00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,420
that they've ring ring fenced off from

00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:45,760
the rest of the environment those things

00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:47,440
cost lots of money to maintain because

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,060
they're all sort of that they've become

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,560
sort of boutique or no one wants to

00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,060
change anything there's real

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,830
opportunities in that sort of

00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,630
environment to actually actually you

00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:57,820
sort of if you automate stuff in those

00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,290
environments to save a lot of money and

00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,330
to become a lot more efficient but it's

00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:03,010
a lot harder to do because making those

00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:06,730
changes tend to be systems like that

00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:08,860
tend to be sort of very fossilized they

00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:10,180
tend to be sort of things that have the

00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,310
organization has become risk-averse

00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,420
about we can't change that no one the no

00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:16,270
one who works you understand how that

00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,860
works anymore but as a result the

00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:19,300
opportunities they are quite large but

00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,410
the risks are quite high the green

00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,980
fields is certainly is if you're a

00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:26,560
startup from day one if it's the classic

00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:28,390
example is agile if you start from day

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,310
one using agile it's far easier to go

00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:32,260
from a legacy development process to an

00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:34,120
agile than going from a legacy to an

00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,290
agile process if you start from scratch

00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:41,020
there

00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:41,020
I think those are genuine character

00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:51,830
no I'm in operation myself and in

00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:54,530
yaariyan is not uncommon situation where

00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:56,960
all the applications are all we all the

00:45:54,530 --> 00:46:01,640
applications that we are deploying we

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:04,370
are not developed in-house so is DevOps

00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:08,930
still relevant and how do you trigger

00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:11,660
this cultural change about automating

00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:15,800
things because we can only automate some

00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:18,470
baseline basic things like SSH

00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,920
configuration vm provisioning and very

00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:24,590
basic stuff all the rest is too diverse

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,310
and too complex to automated to do it

00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:29,810
automatic deployment so I'm I deal a lot

00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:33,440
with customers that about source stuff

00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:35,300
to India and China and its really

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,120
interesting this outsourcing a lot of

00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:40,520
cases it's a very bad name know that

00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,960
people are it's the lowest bidder who's

00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,940
who's outsourced to outsource your stuff

00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,310
too and they've no interested in quality

00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,020
or changing things i think it's it's

00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,460
it's that's the wrong attitude to take

00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,950
the opportunity is there for you to

00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,660
infect those organizations if they

00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,100
understand and there's a couple people

00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,600
here I know there's one person you from

00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,180
India who works in a big Indian IT

00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,860
company who actually can tell you that

00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,270
that those guys are interested in

00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,310
learning new things they want to work on

00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,720
cool technology and if you have an

00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:07,430
opportunity to infect them with a whole

00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,110
different idea about how to do things I

00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,880
think those things will be picked up and

00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,320
there's big cultural barriers in any

00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,370
outsourcing arrangement but I think

00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:18,290
those are also opportunities and it's

00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:20,060
also about demonstrating value so if you

00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:21,170
can demonstrate that that it's a cheaper

00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,210
for the organization to do it a

00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,440
particular way then they're going to

00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,640
jump on that because they want to

00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,650
deliver the service and make a bigger

00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,670
profit I mean if you can deliver you get

00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,230
something out of that you get better

00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:32,210
availability you get a better quality

00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:33,890
service you get a better SLA and they

00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,750
get to do it cheaper or faster or

00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:39,040
whatever it is it's a win-win situation

00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:39,040
for both organizations

00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:58,340
hi I luckily started two weeks ago and

00:47:55,770 --> 00:48:02,580
I'm responsible for implementing

00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:04,860
application monitoring in quite very big

00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:06,810
corporate Belgian environment which

00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:11,690
already says a lot for people know about

00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:15,990
that and I'm facing the fact that the

00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:18,660
operation people have a solar system to

00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:20,520
be able to participate in that but on

00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:23,460
the other hand they saying if don't

00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:27,090
flood us with all your application level

00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:28,920
events and what all the business process

00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:31,350
metrics that you would like to see on

00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,110
the dashboard for the business do you

00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:37,350
have any comment on that or you just

00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:39,240
want to show some empathy so I'm not

00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:43,290
sure I understood the question toilet at

00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:45,240
11am I think again it's about it's about

00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:47,250
demonstrating what what so if you

00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,450
demonstrate that that it was a question

00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:52,320
was the question if I'm paraphrase

00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:53,820
you've got that they're not interested

00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,080
look into business metrics they're not

00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:58,280
interested in looking at the application

00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,280
metrics was it

00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:06,520
well the developers and the business are

00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,740
but the iOS people they want to limit

00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:12,460
the number of events that will go

00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:14,950
through their monitoring systems so what

00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:16,630
I am trying to promote is that to help

00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,160
them changing their mind in such way

00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:22,000
that except that monitoring should go a

00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,680
bit a higher level yeah um I think it is

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,320
about that demonstrating the value of it

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,510
so demonstrating that that that it's

00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,700
that monitoring the CPU the memory and

00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,410
the disk is not the it's not what's

00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,640
important about the application what's

00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,410
important about the application is what

00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,050
business results had delivers still want

00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:39,730
to know about the other stuff but if all

00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,650
of those those metrics are perfect of

00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,180
all of those dashboards are perfect but

00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,260
the response time over here and the

00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,540
other application doesn't do what it's

00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:48,490
supposed to do then then it's not

00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,780
working so they need that you need to

00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:52,090
demonstrate that that if they have

00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,470
another picture of that man necessarily

00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,700
be the same metrics that all the

00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,730
dashboards and the business people look

00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:59,349
at but our view of that and how it links

00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:01,720
to those other metrics that they care

00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:03,369
about infrastructure metrics that's

00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,589
that's that's a way that that you can

00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:07,150
set say you you know this is the picture

00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:10,060
your customers get this is the picture

00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:12,490
that they're seeing and and and they pay

00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,750
your salaries they pay us and we have to

00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,950
work together and solving that

00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:18,710
particular problem or giving that

00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:20,359
particular view thanks probably

00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:27,890
I think there's time for one more

00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:30,070
question any more questions here thanks

00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:30,070
very much

00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,380
