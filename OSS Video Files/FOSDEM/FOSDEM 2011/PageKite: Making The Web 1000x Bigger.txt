	By Bjarni Runar Einarsson
This talk briefly discusses the motivation behind the PageKite project, introduces the software itself and touches on some of the possible use cases for it.

PageKite makes it very easy to run a publicly accessible Web server on any device, including mobile devices such as laptops or Android phones. Instead of relying on traditional dynamic DNS and manual port forwarding, Pagekite creates a zero configuration tunnel between your Web server and a remote front-end. Only the front-end has to have a route-able IP address; the server itself can reside on a heavily firewalled computer, a mobile device, or even an anonymous node on the Tor network.


FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org
