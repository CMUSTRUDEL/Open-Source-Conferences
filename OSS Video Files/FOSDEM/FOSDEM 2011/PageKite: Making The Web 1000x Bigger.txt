Title: PageKite: Making The Web 1000x Bigger
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	By Bjarni Runar Einarsson
This talk briefly discusses the motivation behind the PageKite project, introduces the software itself and touches on some of the possible use cases for it.

PageKite makes it very easy to run a publicly accessible Web server on any device, including mobile devices such as laptops or Android phones. Instead of relying on traditional dynamic DNS and manual port forwarding, Pagekite creates a zero configuration tunnel between your Web server and a remote front-end. Only the front-end has to have a route-able IP address; the server itself can reside on a heavily firewalled computer, a mobile device, or even an anonymous node on the Tor network.


FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

questions well his um he was just asking

00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,820
me why

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:19,520
luckily that's my first topic of

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,680
discussion and the reason is because it

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,539
fits on one slide

00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,480
the Internet's become in some ways

00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,950
really really centralized and Ivan

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,539
Mullen talked about that a bit earlier

00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,780
today and a lot of people are becoming

00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:35,059
more and more worried that these people

00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,699
these these companies really good

00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:40,790
companies doing wonderful work but the

00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:43,250
fact that things are so centralized has

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,030
certain implications and that's sort of

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:50,660
a summary of my opinion on it speaking

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,070
of getting into more detail when I say

00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,870
the way of a centralized what I mean by

00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,059
that is most of our computers most of

00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,699
our devices are not part of the web

00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:00,649
they're consumers so you're running a

00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:03,199
browser and if you want to communicate

00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:06,200
on the web you have to take your data

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,759
your blog post or your photo or your

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,610
video or whatever and you have to upload

00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,369
it and usually you're uploading it to

00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,160
somebody else's computer and even if you

00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:17,270
rented a virtual machine somewhere you

00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,860
know you're still uploading it to

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,380
someone else's computer and if you get

00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,119
in trouble with that person you violate

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,680
their terms and conditions or they

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,619
change their terms and conditions and

00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,509
you're in violation all of a sudden they

00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,860
can shut you down and remove your

00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:34,189
content from the web effectively

00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,229
censoring you if you're using the web

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,509
for personal stuff for private

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:40,759
communication which a lot of us do

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:42,079
thanks to things like Facebook then you

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,610
need to worry about privacy policies

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,579
what our company is going to do with

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,119
your data and most of us have responded

00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:49,119
to this by

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,680
just shrugging not reading the policy

00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:56,409
not worrying about it and hoping we

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,649
don't get burned people who are doing

00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:01,780
sort of I don't know shall we say

00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:04,810
controversial things they might have to

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,580
be actively worried about censorship you

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,440
might have to worry about the DMCA if

00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,970
you're trying to remix content that

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,760
somebody has copyright over and there

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,709
are questions about fair use data

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,140
retention laws bother some people here

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:19,390
in Europe you know issues like that it

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,340
would be really nice if everybody had

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,860
the option of running a web server if

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,450
they wanted to and then there's a

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,049
question can we do that is that possible

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,000
and a little bit of history on why

00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,350
that's generally considered a hard thing

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,450
you know we're we're raised with the

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,930
idea the servers are hard clients are

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:41,280
easy and that's it's a cultural thing

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:44,170
and it's not really true client software

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,299
is no simpler to write the software

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,380
complexity is no lower for a client than

00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:51,670
for a server and you know we can do this

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,720
web servers used to be high-tech you

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,400
have to know how it used to have to know

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,820
how to compile a C program to do it

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,440
today it's built into everything we have

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,850
more processing power in our pockets

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,459
today with our cell phones than the

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,530
WorkFirst web servers had and our

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:07,780
desktops although there's still some

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,090
security issues we now are comfortable

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,790
sharing open Wi-Fi with the room full of

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,970
strangers so we understand security

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:18,130
better but we have this problem left

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,690
we've run out of IP addresses and that

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,560
problem is not getting better any time

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,450
soon last time I gave a variation on

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,250
this talk we hadn't technically run out

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,609
of IP addresses yet but now I can say

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,230
that we have but in practical terms we

00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,900
ran out of IP addresses a long time ago

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,970
because from the point of view of the

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,500
consumer and the average person you've

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,579
never been able to go to your ISP and

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,590
say hey I want 10 IP addresses your ISP

00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,700
would say no no that's not a service

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,680
that's available unless you're willing

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,870
to pay the prices the companies pay for

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,250
you know dedicated leased lines the

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,430
average person never had enough IP

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,750
addresses to run a few servers at home

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,420
so that's that's the issue that I'm

00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,470
trying to work on with pagekite you know

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,230
overcoming this

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,030
so assuming we had a web server on every

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,100
single device how do you make it

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,630
reachable how do you put that server

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,720
actually on the web where people can see

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:13,330
it and the solution that I'm working on

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,190
is based on you know fancy word protocol

00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,040
layer routing it's really just tunnels

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,840
and proxies and there's some existing

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,780
code that you can sort of pack together

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,030
to achieve this if you set up an SSH

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,370
tunnel from your laptop you can do some

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,200
ports and forwarding logic in Apache you

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,570
can make a website visible but it's a

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,680
lot of work and it's not very stable and

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,130
it's certainly not something the average

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,470
person is going to do if your anonymity

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,330
person then you might like tor and you

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,120
might know about hidden services and

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,920
those are cool they get the job done but

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,050
you're stuck with a really slow website

00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,200
with a really really ugly name because

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:53,470
every single hidden service has an md5

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,660
hash for a name you can go closed source

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,490
and use opera unites that means that

00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,280
your web server is living inside a web

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:03,430
browser which just seems weird to me or

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,740
you can try pagekite which is a dual

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,180
project of company that's doing a

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,140
service and then an open-source

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,669
implementation which is completely free

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,790
one of the questions I get is you know

00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:18,190
isn't ipv6 going to solve this problem

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,750
and I say no and the reason I think IP 6

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,960
won't solve this problem is because of

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,580
two things firewalls and mobility people

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,500
are not going to stop putting firewalls

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,410
on their networks because they're afraid

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,870
of the internet and rightly so so you're

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,370
not going to have unfiltered access the

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,320
ISPs are going to do this for you

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,460
they're going to block access to port 80

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,159
because they want to sell you that

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,439
service

00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:42,599
and your mobile you're changing networks

00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:46,020
three or four times a day you don't have

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:48,449
a static IP address most of the time so

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,999
here's a little diagram of what protocol

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,319
layer routing you know looks application

00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:55,679
layer routing looks like from the point

00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,719
of view of Firefox so that green thing

00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:59,759
there represents the tunnel that we

00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:01,580
would establish between the laptop and

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,229
and something I'm calling a front-end

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,249
browser looks up the domain gets an IP

00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:09,749
address contacts it requests a web page

00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:11,580
that just gets forward and the data

00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:13,439
comes back now the important thing about

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,119
this is you know most of you know how

00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,249
this works but the important thing about

00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:19,139
the solution is that from the point of

00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:21,089
view of the web browser this is exactly

00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,009
the same nothing's changed the fact that

00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,699
the request goes over a tunnel and comes

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:29,189
back the web browser doesn't even know

00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:31,999
so I can't tell how much time I've used

00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:36,269
but start talking about pagekite itself

00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:37,949
so pagekite pi is a single file Python

00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,569
program I've tried to keep it as simple

00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:41,639
and easy to install as possible because

00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,679
I want this to be able to run everywhere

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,149
and you forgot a Mac you already have

00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:48,779
Python you can run it without installing

00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:50,279
any dependencies it's free software it's

00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,939
supposed to be easy to install and use

00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,959
it does HTTP it does HTTP and it also

00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:56,429
does SSH

00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,319
so if you have a machine somewhere

00:06:56,429 --> 00:07:00,749
that's stuck behind a firewall and you

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,459
want to be able to SSH in pagekite it's

00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:04,559
probably one of the easiest ways to make

00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:08,309
that happen today

00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:09,569
the tunnel itself is protocol agnostic

00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:11,309
so we can add support for other

00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:13,949
protocols as people become interested in

00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:16,289
those and it compresses the traffic

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:19,050
because people generally have limited

00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:20,759
upstream bandwidth

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,590
this single Python program will

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,180
implement both ends of the tunnel so on

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,590
the diagram before you had one computer

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,900
in the cloud and one computer at home

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,280
the same piece of software and

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,759
influenced both ends this is all you

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,800
need to use this that has a HTTP server

00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,340
using Diagnostics and eventually might

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,870
allow you to reconfigure it some

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,490
limitations I'm not going to dwell on

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,570
this but I'm going to acknowledge them

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,810
they don't have much time most telling

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,979
when there is the HTTP limitation where

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,199
we basically have to wait a few years

00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,810
for everybody to upgrade their browsers

00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,259
and things like that for in order to be

00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:01,289
able to do reliable name based protocol

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,580
level routing of HTTP requests but if

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:03,960
you can convince the people that are

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,150
visiting your website to install Chrome

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,270
or use a recent Firefox then it's not a

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,060
problem and of course there's this one a

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,300
lot of people just don't like the idea

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,099
but it does work really really well so

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,979
here's an example of what you'd have to

00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:22,650
run on your server on the Internet

00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,870
I'm running that as route because it

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:28,620
needs to bind port 80 and 443 you can

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:30,240
also use some IP tables tricks you know

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,870
kernel level stuff to get around that

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,580
but this command will work and this is

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,339
what you would run on a laptop so

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,440
basically the same stuff you know the

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,300
name of the domain which services you're

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,570
interested in publishing and then you

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,940
tell the the backend pagekite where the

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,320
actual server is and it doesn't have to

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,080
be on localhost it can be some other

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,860
device on your local network but

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,000
localhost is the common case

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,340
then there's the other half there's the

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,860
the service the company all that stuff

00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,390
and I'm trying to do this because I want

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,920
to accomplish two things you know I want

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,570
to be able to fund its further

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,610
development of pagekite and I want to

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,020
bring this technology to the average

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,200
people not just to the geeks in this

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,020
room and that means that someone needs

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,910
to provide these front ends and the

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,580
front ends they cost bandwidth they need

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,960
some resources so I'm trying to build a

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,880
company and some sort of business model

00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,720
around making that service available to

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,580
people because it doesn't exist today

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,950
some features that the the service and

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,930
the company provide the one I'm really

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,640
excited about right now which is also

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,140
going to be controversial and hoping to

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,970
have arguments with some security people

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,300
about this is I would like to provide

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,380
SSL to everyone all the time and I can

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,500
do that by putting a wild-card

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,360
certificate on the front end terminate

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,890
the encryption there and then make sure

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,960
that the tunnel itself is encrypted as

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,490
well and this of course means that the

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,650
front end can spy on your traffic but

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,030
nobody else can and that's a significant

00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,930
improvement for think people that are

00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,930
worried about things like Firesheep

00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:06,000
there's the business model we have today

00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:09,810
it's really simple I don't know if

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,120
people are going to like it this is an

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,950
example the same thing because before

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,770
except this time you just say - -

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,450
defaults and I'm showing you here at the

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,060
bottom how you would actually expose

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,410
your sage server as well because it's

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,280
turned out that's one of the things that

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,280
gets the geeks excited

00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,480
so this is simple long-term I would like

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,190
technology like this you know I'm not

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
just selfishly saying I want everyone to

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,240
depend on my company but if we can put

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,910
technology like this things like the

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,750
espera or status net or those things we

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,640
can start getting some really

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,920
interesting innovations and you know

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,170
what people do with these servers

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,630
now once the web server itself has

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,190
direct access to your web cam has direct

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,500
access to your media library has a

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,630
terabyte of hard drive space you've

00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,100
avoided a lot of limitations that these

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,990
cloud providers have to deal with every

00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,610
day and we can start implementing

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,530
features that are just too expensive for

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,810
them to implement in their centralized

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,480
networks so we can start competing on

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,280
something else some other message than

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,710
just you know it needs to be private

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,840
because message doesn't resonate with

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,640
everybody but if you tell people hey you

00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,900
can share your files with your family

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,730
and you don't need a separate

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,900
application to do that then a social

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,350
network starts becoming pretty

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,420
interesting I've seen some other use

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,040
cases this is stuff that I've done I've

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,240
run it on my phone I did that at a

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,760
conference just to show off that it

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,340
worked I've got four Linux virtual

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,260
machines running on a server in a corner

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,880
in my living room and they're all

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,320
visible I didn't have to reconfigure the

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,790
router I didn't have to do anything I

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:44,100
just ran that Python command the guy who

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,570
does the web designs for me he's really

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,420
excited about this because he can show

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,220
off his work as it's in progress he can

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,390
just call up a client and say hey just

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,640
visit this website this is what I'm

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,710
doing right now he can avoid completely

00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,270
the step of uploading and copying and

00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,460
you know going through some sort of

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:01,950
publishing rigmarole which he just has

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,080
it on his laptop I've seen teachers

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,850
publishing you know plasma Tyrael off

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,830
recycled Hardware pulling up some old

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,360
machines they just install this they

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:13,570
never have to talk to the network admin

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,880
it just works and that appeals to them

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,370
Sene Arduino hackers sending weather

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,930
information to pachoo because again they

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,000
didn't have access to reconfigure the

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:26,019
Wi-Fi they were using so they couldn't

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,959
do the port forwarding trick and this is

00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,850
the one that surprised me and it was

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:33,519
guys that are cutting chicken we're

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,800
using automatic machinery in factories

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,600
they were like hey this this means we

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,630
can just give every single chicken

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,550
cutting machine a name and we can use

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,380
SSH and we can use VNC and we can just

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,850
get right go right in there some home

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:51,190
and save thousands of dollars on plane

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:52,899
tickets and I was like okay do that so

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,149
anytime your router or firewall is in

00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:58,089
the way of publishing a server this

00:12:55,149 --> 00:13:00,100
could be a useful tool and I said it's

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:02,470
open it's free and I would really need

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:07,209
more users to test it and and help me

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:09,610
figure out what to do with it so I think

00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:13,840
I have time for questions I'm not sure

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:18,130
yeah honey

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,340
I can encourage you by doing the bonus

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,340
slide

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:29,310
all right check it out like we have

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,740
twitter account name pagekite and i

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,760
tweeted the location of the slides if

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,130
you want to go over any of this stuff

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,720
again and of course you know there's the

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:41,809
website and so forth so

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,809
