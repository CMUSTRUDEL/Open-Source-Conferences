Title: Liberating Open Office Development
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	By Michael Meeks 

LibreOffice is the most powerful and viable Free Softare office suite, available cross-platform. As well as a few demos showing its joys, we'll understand the history, and rational behind the LibreOffice project and its relation to OpenOffice.org.

We will survey the threat to the Free Software ecosystem that poorly managed, corporate dominated, copyright assignment based projects can cause. Then we'll get stuck into new features, our development roadmap, and how to get involved develping with it - even if you are not (yet) a super-star hacker. Come and get involved with something exciting, and help make tens of millions of user's first experience of Free Software something to be proud of.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

welcome back to the Janssen room now on

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,799
to office for the final half of the day

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,060
michael meeks is here to talk about

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,859
libre office so yeah hello hello hello

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,830
hello hello one two three four five six

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,210
brilliant excellent thank you well thank

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,760
you so much for coming it's fantastic to

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,699
have you all here and isn't fossum great

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,219
i love for stem hey ah brilliant

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,809
excellent so this is what i'm going to

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,370
say i'd like to persuade you it's worth

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,250
staying and listening but maybe it isn't

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,320
who knows let's see um yeah these are my

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,059
views just so you know that Libre Office

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,070
is better and fun so I'll persuade you

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,410
hopefully of that first and then I want

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,420
to talk about licensing and how licenses

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,570
should apply to everyone not just most

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,100
people which is really important um and

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,809
then I want to say yeah basically thanks

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,460
for your help and show you how to get

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,699
involved which would be great so that we

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,050
get perfect so what is the office on the

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,140
document foundation well finally we're

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,240
doing this thing right you know we hope

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,470
now if we're not at least we have an

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,780
open process so you can come and get

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,760
involved and help us out and show us the

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,619
light which is cool so a vendor-neutral

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,640
no one's in charge I happen to work from

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,890
the velvet spot the Libre Office

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,409
t-shirts and the D Brandon slides good

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,970
excellent so it's a real free software

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,320
and hackers project this you know you

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,180
can get stuck in and get your code

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,650
included quickly and we have loads of

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,720
people involved primarily the volunteers

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,159
i love volunteers i love to employee

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,170
volunteers but then they're no longer

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,759
volunteers which is there's one of those

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,490
tragedies you know that you hire the

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,869
best people anyway so but we have some

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,460
great volunteers obviously there's red

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,500
hat enough L debian canonical just hired

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,790
a guy which is great google provides all

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
sorts of support through google Summer

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,360
of Code and so on but just give you some

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,549
idea of you know that this is an idea

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,079
whose time has finally come the people

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,570
supporting our launch were boycott

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,829
nevell and the vel so that's pretty good

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,770
you know if we can agree on something

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,079
then that's pretty good um the FSF and

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,630
the OSI you know traditional lovers of

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,680
each other both in our press release one

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,299
at the top and one at the bottom you

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,530
know does it this is pretty cool I mean

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,670
I just thought that the widespread

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,119
support we've had has been fantastic

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,250
free desktop hosting us the lgpl v3 + +

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,959
MPL for new code key commercially

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,890
friendly license in some ways I guess to

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,780
try and keep

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,959
the door open for Oracle to come in and

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,780
IBM and so on and yet you know obviously

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,340
stick with the GPL we love that's only

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,080
for new code suddenly the code from

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,819
Sony's license with a non plus license

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,910
the lgpl v3 but I'll get on to that

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,110
later so yeah and this is our goal we

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,150
want a beautiful office suite that we

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,580
can be proud of now there are several

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,160
views on open office and they range

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,510
geographically it's interesting it's

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,800
interesting obviously if you live in

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,630
Africa you moan about the performance

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,880
problems and your hardware is slow maybe

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,950
you know that that's bad as a gross

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,780
stereotype business um if you live in

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,150
hamburg you have this view that it is a

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,489
beautiful but misunderstood thing you

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,260
know it's funny that um but the rest of

00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,150
the world thinks it's about the best we

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,530
have as of now but it's really not as

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,239
good as it could be you know this is

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,310
this is something that I ought to

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,459
encourage my friends and family to use

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,680
but i feel kind of a bit you know again

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,180
I cope with the support costs of this

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,310
you know the the emotional capital you

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,810
know so we want to improve it we want to

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,790
make it into something beautiful and

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,019
reliable a high quality and something

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,630
actually we can be proud of and that

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,459
works not just well but better than

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,570
anything else there is and there are

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,250
lots of projects out there that do this

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,810
I mean you know you take a look at GCC

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,430
maybe it's not beautiful inside I

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,829
actually no it isn't beautiful inside

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,840
but it is the leading cross-platform

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:32,220
compiler tool it's just just nothing

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,989
else there or you look at the linux

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,579
kernel i mean the people don't even

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,410
bother marketing against it because they

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,090
just look silly you know i mean you want

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,100
to bring a performance comparison come

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,840
on bring it you know and we'll fix it

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,610
and blow you out of the water so i think

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,500
we can be there you know and that's

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,329
that's where we want to be and we're

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,010
shipping on windows mac a new gnu/linux

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,620
just just so you know we you know we

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,920
love the FSF we're even willing as you

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,810
know to to bow to the slash you know um

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,250
which is good you know I in Free

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,500
Software Foundation is fantastic we're

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,910
not formally affiliated with them but we

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,160
love free software so that's where we're

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,840
at and of course ODF enables you to move

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,209
in and out of LibreOffice really easily

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,380
so another thing that people often come

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,560
and say to me because they're bitter and

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,940
twisted even more than I am they say is

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,530
it'll Oracle's fault you know say nasty

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,180
things about racal and you know Oracle

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,470
have some serious serious problems to

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,940
wrestle with them it's not really

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,340
anything to do with Oracle actually

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,349
literally profits um there was always

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,940
this hope for a foundation this passion

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,750
that we would actually get there you

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,210
know that the

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,760
miss of a foundation which was given as

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,070
the project was created would actually

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,380
be fulfilled but all these excuses you

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,030
know the time is not yet ripe what does

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,460
that mean you know right i mean the

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,070
problem is time tends to go bad and rot

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,080
before it becomes ripe often so anyway

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,760
perhaps perhaps in another few years and

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,710
so on but our patients is essentially

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,390
not inexhaustible but it had pretty much

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,400
run out and then oracle it's going to

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,660
buy Sonnen was this great hope that you

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,550
know don't be positive change so we

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,650
waited and waited but in the end the

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,419
change didn't come so luckily we've been

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,169
left with some fantastic opportunities

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,970
for improvement which we'll see later

00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,980
but the key key improvement is this

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,780
vendor neutrality no copyright

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,060
assignments particularly to corporations

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,430
and just a much lower barrier to entry

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,750
you can get your code in we want you to

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,550
contribute we'd love to have you

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,710
involved it would be fantastic if all of

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,390
you guys contributed we wouldn't have an

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,590
obvious problem in the next year in a

00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,540
year's time I could come here and tell

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,400
you the end of you know the end of

00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,400
proprietary office software was was nice

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,080
so that's cool so it's really unrelated

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,120
relatively unrelated to Oracle start a

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,650
vision is its own separate thing it does

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,510
what it likes and this is what it likes

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,250
and they have hard problems I mean you

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,250
know they have nasty business numbers

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,229
they have to make and and honestly the

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,840
community has failed them from their

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,580
perspective actually you know because of

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,510
many of their decisions and I would

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,130
argue that these are the kind of

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,350
decisions that really screw up a

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,240
community but they've tried in all

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,440
honesty and they haven't got a whole lot

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,690
out of it you know it's in more pain

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,310
than is a shame when you're trying to

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,810
say look do more of this openness and

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,820
they say well we tried and it didn't

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,290
work so I'd like to persuade you that

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,880
there's a local minima where you get all

00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,640
of the negative effects and none of the

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,540
positives if you try and over control

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,020
your project if you're thinking of

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,160
opening sourcing something don't own it

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,070
give other people license that you

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,860
accept yourself actors appear and that

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,720
seems so scary but go all the way don't

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,610
go halfway and capture all the negatives

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,930
of giving a product away and get none of

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,750
the positives of getting other people

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,160
involved so so you see anyway and there

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,720
are great friends and hackers in Oracle

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,070
I love Stefan Bergman is sitting here

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,780
listening to my every word he's

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,090
fantastic and well there's probably some

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,280
other people I can't see because sir my

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,110
eyesight gets worse and really this is a

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,639
good motivation you know then do things

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,990
because because of other people

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,780
just do it because you love freedom and

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,280
not not heating ism we deliberately

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,659
trying to keep the door opens Oracle so

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,520
they can join we would love that that'd

00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:54,810
be fantastic so on a negative side um a

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,999
lot of people come to me and they say

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,229
ìwell LibreOffice yeah it's all nice and

00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,460
all that but it's irrelevant the web is

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:01,949
going to swallow everything you know

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,560
this giant blob that is the web is going

00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:05,580
to come and roll you flat you know it's

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,560
interesting because I've been hearing

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,060
this argument for many years the first

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,189
time i heard it was the smartphone thing

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,360
give up on desktop applications the

00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,680
smartphone is going to be the whole

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,199
market in the next you know two years

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,389
hey i heard that in about year 2000 or

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,729
was it 99 good thing i didn't invest

00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:23,039
then huh anyway so finally it's come

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:24,479
coming more true um but you know that

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,360
adds a new tension to the web

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,400
development but anyhow so the logical

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,050
conclusion of a fully functional offline

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,240
office suite if you want all of the

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,409
features to actually work is you need to

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,400
rewrite everything in JavaScript well I

00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,360
mean you don't have to write in

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,919
JavaScript you could write in something

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,529
else and then compile it to JavaScript

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,240
you know maybe when the GCC JavaScript

00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,069
backend arrives you know that we'll

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,110
we'll just have it you know the awesome

00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:50,699
I'm a best of luck with that project you

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,979
know we have plenty of bugs as it is

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,300
with our typesafe checking and all the

00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,710
sort of thing so I don't think that's

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,669
going to work but the other problem the

00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,740
other reason why it's not going to work

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,810
if you don't do that and you leave a lot

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,399
of it online which can work that that

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,779
would work you have this problem of

00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,310
internet connectivity and I must say I

00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,599
was the speaks dinner last night with

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,550
the people doing the infrastructure here

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,779
it's fantastic this is the first college

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,460
lab you know actually you have fast

00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,919
internet and actually works I hope it's

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,629
actually working for you um this is the

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,069
exception not the rule I would hasten to

00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,599
act you know and it would be bad if I

00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,129
were presenting at the front here from a

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:24,659
web app and I couldn't get a domain name

00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:25,919
server you know or a dhcp lease um or it

00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:27,389
comes with customers site and 3g in

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,529
effect the most interesting thing is

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:32,039
that the people who are supposed to

00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:33,300
believe most in the web don't so the

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,459
people who you would think believed in

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,039
always on connectivity would be say 3g

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:40,740
data providers mobile companies making

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,539
mobile phones right so they believe that

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,459
you're always on the internet course not

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,990
they put loads of software on your

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:49,079
device where is your address book does

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,819
it live in the cloud no course not

00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,170
because i'm going to lean how the window

00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:54,240
like this to get a signal so that i can

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,020
use my landlines that you know it you

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,850
need

00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,300
data locally it makes sense to have fat

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,350
clients so yeah and i think you know of

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,420
course there's a lot of good on the web

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,530
don't let don't get me confused but i

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,880
think at the end of the day the cloud is

00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,980
pretty much a rent vs buy thing

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,690
brilliant for service stuff brilliant

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,240
you know for that sort of thing but for

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,280
desktop applications it's not there yet

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,380
and anyway my phone is makes you super

00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,080
computer yeah you should have been using

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,760
them they're great um and so we can run

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,620
you know something like libre office on

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,210
the phone starting actually very quickly

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,010
because it's usually have their flash in

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,380
them a lot of our start time is just

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,030
seeking on slow disks so actually you

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,150
can start LibreOffice honor on a you

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:35,550
know shop arm-based handheld device as

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:39,870
quickly as you can on a relatively fast

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:41,130
one laptop so WYSIWYG yeah and some

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,110
things are basically just impossible in

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,720
HTML for in html5 they become more

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,590
possible and actually I think html5

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,780
school so they go how's it going well

00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:53,910
extremely well we have 100-plus entirely

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,140
new code contributors so I'm watchin you

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,580
can't see this in the graph because it

00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,290
doesn't tell you if this guy here the

00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,940
the 40 people are committed in this week

00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,130
that we'd never ever seen before we

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,110
launched with the same as the you know

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,750
thought 35 they committed in this week

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,300
or the you know 41 the committed nuh so

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,190
this is just people per week this is

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,390
Christmas incidentally and what this

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,920
tells you is that commercial people go

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,560
on holiday Christmas but volunteers you

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,180
know yeah so these are presumably the

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,470
sociopathic fringe here that don't talk

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,950
to their family I don't know something

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,390
like that anyhow yeah and yeah thanks

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,340
all good we appreciate people like that

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,720
um and it's coming back up to Christmas

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,760
actually we did our release here so some

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,260
of this is trailing off because the 300

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,340
release and it's taken a great thing

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,960
jump again offer release but the

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,030
punchline is there a hundred hundred

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,730
plus in tithing eco contributors with

00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,540
code included those whose patches have

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,220
been reviewed and got into the

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,440
repository of course there's companies

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,450
as well Oracle novelle of the Oracles

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,900
cadriah emerging when it comes from them

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:51,810
I'm Red Hat Annabelle and of course

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,480
canonical now and so there's this

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,130
considerable growth here half a

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,720
translator every day so 50 plus new

00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,160
translators again with stuff in these

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,550
are the the concrete numbers the real

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,170
numbers may be bigger so that's

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,390
fantastic the encouraging I'm encouraged

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,410
one you developer each day approximately

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,660
since we launched and the

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:14,500
still room for more really there's a lot

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,180
of room for more so yeah develop ace and

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,829
we thought this great new release to do

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,449
which I talk about later sadly Oracle

00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:21,129
want joining us in name directly

00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:22,990
although they clearly contribute via the

00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:24,040
inclusion of their code and which looks

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,029
like it's getting smaller here but

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,740
really that's because they were working

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:28,660
on their stable development branch as

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,189
well so I don't think their contribution

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,100
of shrunk that's just an artifact of the

00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,360
graph so what are we doing well we're

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,329
trying to pay down some of the vast

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,620
technical debt that we've inherited so

00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,850
you know if you're a proprietary product

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,019
and you're working to commercial

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,160
deadlines and so on there are many

00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,100
things you just don't do because they

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,089
don't make commercial sense such as

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,459
reading code to make you look pretty

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,259
that's a total waste of time trying to

00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,730
remove cruft from your code refactoring

00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,560
old stuff out doesn't make any sense

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,879
commercially but it certainly makes

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,189
sense in terms of the long-term

00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,079
sustaining of the code and try to

00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:01,060
persuade management to let you do things

00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:03,220
that don't generate value or parent

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,329
value it's really hard you know with

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,850
these people their short-term horizons

00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:08,620
but our community we can do that so it's

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,680
been 20 plus years of organic growth

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,389
maybe 25 now and without any refactoring

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,480
with a generally a total lack of code

00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:18,069
review and you know it's quite an

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,420
interesting code base and one of the

00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:20,560
things I like is the optin approach to

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,910
life cycle management you know if you're

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,009
a Java programmer you have a garbage

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,149
collector which is great you know you

00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,490
know you don't have the free anything

00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:28,420
and if your C++ programmer you can

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,889
believe that you have a garbage

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,930
collector you know that deals with

00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,610
reference loops and you know free stuff

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,959
automatically but unfortunately you

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,300
don't so this here is a beautiful graph

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,620
as produced by IBM and what they do is

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,470
they have a basic script that loads of

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,759
documents saves it and closes it and it

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,470
does this for some documents and doesn't

00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:47,199
little do this is the number of times of

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,790
open and close closes very mind at the

00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,430
end of this there's nothing in there

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,649
that's just an empty frame right so you

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,509
would hope it should be flat and it used

00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,759
to be fairly flat but now we're up to

00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,649
sort of well huh no for Oklahoma's 31

00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,059
was up to 250 megabytes instantly the

00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:03,880
the end of the line is wrecked crashes

00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:06,069
so you know that should say you know so

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,569
um we've been trying to get the slope of

00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:08,649
this curve down that's one of the things

00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:10,389
you're doing Quinlan's me doing some

00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,220
fantastic work there with valgrind and

00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,829
tracing reference leaks and part of that

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,750
is because actually open office would

00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:20,829
routinely crash when it exited which is

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:22,240
fine for weird weird weird reasons often

00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:23,620
you know you have many threads and the

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,970
pthread Mutis ease are holding them

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,740
stopping them doing anything dumb and

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,600
then they're automatically deleted

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,910
because they're C++ objects right so as

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,380
you exit cleanly they're automatically

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,660
deleted in these threads suddenly race

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,970
on and do dumb stuff right ok our

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,529
scribbling over and that's fine for me

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,310
because mostly we never see that but red

00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:40,959
hat we're getting all these crash

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,540
reports you know that crash reporter was

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,770
filled full of you know crashes on exit

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,510
and so on and it's bad when you have

00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,149
unit tests because unit tests are meant

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,589
to exit cleanly and if one in three

00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:52,510
times you run it it just crashes

00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:54,310
everywhere this is not good so we've

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,470
done a lot of fixing that other problems

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,209
translating the the code so yeah you

00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,890
know it's virtually useless comments you

00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:01,870
know the cups cups style of commenting

00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,510
if you haven't read cups you know if

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,820
you're feeling sad you know and you all

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,899
your unit you have getting just really

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,610
low and you think you're not a good

00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,430
programmer go and read the cups code in

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,529
it just it just warms your heart you

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,470
know in I this is an integer variable

00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:18,820
you know I mean it just I learned so

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,589
much programming just by reading cups

00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,660
yet anyway here we also are somewhat

00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:24,730
more useful often with you know date

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,220
stamps and authors muscles things that's

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,630
pretty cool and they're a lot more there

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,310
are really useful but unfortunately a

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,290
lot of them in German German and so we

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,700
have a fantastic German comment detector

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,800
that uses Libra offices language

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,360
detection code which will detect

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,850
languages and blocks of text so you can

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,079
do the right spell checking on them and

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,000
yeah we possible comments I got hard

00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,700
German comment so if you're German and

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,770
you can read this we need you we need

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,089
you and it's easy to contribute you know

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,399
make a difference making the code base

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,899
more useful another thing is revision

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,899
control so open office had a chequered

00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:57,550
history of revision control and it's

00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,140
migrated several times pointlessly

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,450
losing revision history left and right

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,130
he used to be horrendously slow multiple

00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,010
hours to tackle the repository just for

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,020
one module like writer after years of

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,670
pain we had analysis and rejected get

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,589
because they wanted really to use

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,810
mercurial but they moved temporarily to

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,579
subversion and then from subversion onto

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,140
mercurial and routinely lost history at

00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:18,490
each of these steps and so a reliable

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,470
work around if you're a programmer that

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,820
cares about how the code got there was

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,060
to add all of these comments the code

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,910
saying things like ah you know this

00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,980
changed in 2005 12 12 with this issue

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,209
and so on and so on so at least you know

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,800
who did what right i mean you can

00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:34,660
usually get some information out of it

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,100
and i'm watching this whole lead of

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,360
issue trackers well

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,329
the internal issue tracker we have no

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,279
insight into but it's so we're removing

00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:44,230
cruft to make the code easier to read

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:48,190
now things like you know cop I'm new

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:49,959
years since 2008 05 you know you laugh

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,850
but you know there are tens of thousands

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,620
if not you know hundreds of thousands of

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,540
lines of code things ISIL the Chinese

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,490
did a huge refactor but obviously they

00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,709
didn't trust the Chinese very much they

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,259
hired so they encourage and add comment

00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:04,600
china and the number of the change that

00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:05,769
they did at the end so routinely again

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,380
hundreds of thousands of lines of code

00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:10,029
with random it was done by a chinese guy

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,370
like I like Chinese people I think you

00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:15,459
can trust them so we removed all that

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,870
and if zero you know if the code is not

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,339
in use and you don't trust your revision

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,660
control system it's very sensible if

00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:21,730
you've got a nice piece of tested code

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,829
not to actually remove it from the code

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,839
but just a you know either comment out a

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:27,190
shift if it out so you know it's there

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,959
you know you might need it later right

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,899
you wrote it and tested it why get rid

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,000
of it so this really again tends two

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:36,819
hundred thousand lines of code of just

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,339
not compiled and it's a sad because we

00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:40,899
use git and we think it's cool and so we

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:42,399
just we're confident that it will

00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:45,339
continue to be there are history and so

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,990
we remove this stuff with great glee so

00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,370
what are we doing well we're trying to

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,870
make it easy to contribute so people can

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,060
actually get involved and be effective

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:55,540
and do good things so have a wiki page

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,459
full of easy hacks and you can go there

00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,899
and you can you can do what random stuff

00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:00,130
but more than that I mean if it's not an

00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:02,800
easy hack and you have something that

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,539
you want to do we give permission we

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,980
encourage you to change and break and

00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:08,380
fiddle with LibreOffice the sender's

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,880
patches we'd love that and you know we

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,919
will almost certainly be merging them in

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,530
somewhere unless their scrutiny mental

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,559
right but so we really want people

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,419
involved I took about unit tests the

00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:20,559
were virtually none unfortunately runs

00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:22,600
during build for various reasons I think

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,490
there's some now in the the Oracle tree

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,260
but we have a number that are doing

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,289
quite a lot of good things every build

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:32,830
on every platform yea votes is an object

00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:34,450
a system a system abstraction library

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,640
that was deprecated nearly a decade were

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,230
probably more than a decade ago bang us

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,360
there when we first released a open

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,130
office and someone finally wrote it out

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,140
of the code which is great because it

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,179
was all duplication of other stuff while

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,080
they wrapped around that and we've

00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,360
merged a whole load of outstanding

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Debian RedHat and avail patch sets so we

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,700
have a single bed

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,769
we're all working on that which is great

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,529
and lives of community features so RTF

00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:58,450
exports refactoring the code fixing

00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:00,549
hundreds of bugs sharing the export core

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,080
and so on reducing cave duplication and

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,850
poking that's just one guy Niklas has

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,110
been doing that in line interactive form

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,460
you're editing and these two google

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,169
Summer of Code guys who have our

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,490
outstanding done by eunice so you can as

00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:11,200
you edit your formula in your document

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,390
rather than and some kind of like

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,309
formula language at the bottom which we

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,500
kept but you know you can choose and

00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:19,630
things like running Lintz on amla code

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,360
is just an example what's all the people

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,590
look at my graph of a hundred entirely

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,059
new code contributing they say are but

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,519
the only consumed contributing a

00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:28,990
one-line change you know and it's

00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,950
meaningless you know what's a one-line

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,470
change why does that mean anything

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,700
you're just inflating the figures I have

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,799
a lot to say to that I mean first of all

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,110
I think if you get no one contributing

00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,360
one line changes you have a problem with

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,559
your process yeah because some bugs are

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,389
one line change here's one of the mic

00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,639
particularly like so this bug was opened

00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:48,639
in 2007 with a test case which said

00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:51,970
basically run this macro and um yeah so

00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:55,120
we have 9999 we add one to it and we get

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:57,850
one good isn't it particularly useful in

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,750
a financial application you know boom

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:04,389
and and thus Enron was born yeah yeah

00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:07,029
yeahs drat that was my was my donors hey

00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:08,409
how so um so I don't know this guy turns

00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:10,059
up this is his history he writes on the

00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,409
list he commits his first trivial patch

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:13,269
of total meaninglessness you know I mean

00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:14,380
fixing a comment or something but the

00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,909
thing is this is how people interact

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,769
they push on the door and are you going

00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,720
to sit down a write a month of work and

00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:22,450
then post a monster patch the mailing

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,250
list no that would just be ridiculous

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,179
right I mean you might write took

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,440
through the wrong thing they might not

00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:28,779
even accept your code they might leave

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,190
it lingering in a bugzilla for years

00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:31,480
without merging it why would you waste

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,039
your life like that instead what you do

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,019
is you send a small patch they go way

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,360
good to see you're cool I love it what

00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:39,820
about just this minor tweak and you get

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,080
you know if you love so two days later

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,610
you know he sent some warning patches

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,830
then he tries to do a word count there's

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,929
some idiot fix in the word count for

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,220
each others butts um sadly someone else

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:49,299
has done it so he goes away asked you

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,100
know what should I do they're just

00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:53,289
appears later having analyzed this

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,899
beautiful analysis exactly what's wrong

00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:58,360
it's a missing equals or less than in a

00:19:55,899 --> 00:20:01,149
less than or equals anyway one line fix

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,679
the bug open since 2007 with the test

00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,879
case so the other thing that people like

00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,259
to say is that Lieber office

00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:06,759
just open office it has no new feature

00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:07,899
so I have a whole load of random slides

00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,489
in between my talk just that new

00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:12,609
features that are actually kind of

00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:14,919
useful SVG was the number one wanted

00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:16,809
user feature so this is if you look in

00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,729
the votes of issues or there are two top

00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:20,289
features that's number one it's been

00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:22,359
like that for years and not being fixed

00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:24,609
it's not perfect but it's a lot better

00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,349
than nothing if you have an SVG file um

00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:27,849
another thing that happens is because we

00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:30,099
have this wonderful meta component

00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:32,289
technology which is actually far harder

00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:35,919
to use than the native c plus plus sadly

00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:36,940
we bundle everything's extensions you

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,039
know which is good it's worked for

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,659
Firefox so it must work for us right but

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,119
the problem is we put loads of

00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:44,829
functionality in this repository that no

00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,599
one goes to and all the downloads

00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:48,579
statistics are there some tiny fraction

00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,499
of our users less than one percent of

00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:52,119
our users actually download the

00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,919
presenter console so I compared the

00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,529
daily downloads on the daily extension

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,209
Alison it's ridiculous what you know

00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:00,129
this is kind of a useful feature if

00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:01,659
you're presenting so we bundle things

00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:03,699
that make sense so that people actually

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,019
get them instead of not knowing they

00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:08,349
even exist because they're in some

00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:09,909
random place oh yeah I talked about the

00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:11,079
inline formula editing and this

00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:13,089
highlights another thing we have an

00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:14,979
experimental mode now so you can turn on

00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:16,809
enable the crazy features you know the

00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:18,099
stuff that doesn't quite work yet there

00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,319
you can even crash your office suite if

00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:22,029
you do that I think there's probably

00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,190
some corner cases breaks but anyway so

00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:26,469
you can go and turn these things on and

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,319
in fact it turns something's off so you

00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:30,489
know we've done some features into

00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,289
experimental features because they never

00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:34,719
worked that well anyway like macro

00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:37,599
recording so yeah so that's pretty cool

00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:38,469
and again a volunteer did that but one

00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,119
of the things I really want to talk

00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:42,759
about and perhaps this is not to

00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:44,859
everyone's taste is what happened here

00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,359
what changed you know is it just a list

00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,709
of easy things you can get involved in

00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,999
because any idiot can tell you that's a

00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:50,889
good thing to do right you don't need to

00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:53,619
be a genius to blow the barrier to entry

00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:55,679
but what really happened here to make

00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:59,440
the project actually starts to exist I

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,659
don't like spot the difference let's see

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,519
so I'd like to argue that what changed

00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:06,279
there was really primarily around

00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,499
copyright Simon it's really around

00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,409
vendors owning and controlling your code

00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:12,729
and people asking to have special

00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:15,069
exceptions from the license that

00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:17,229
everyone else has I think this is one of

00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,680
the most problematic and subtle threats

00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:19,900
we

00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,520
the free software movement today and I

00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,980
think synapse has an article he's going

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,110
to publish soon about the backgrounds

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,430
and I try and summarize it's quite a

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,730
complicated issue but I think basically

00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,990
check the license applies to everyone

00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,700
and if you've assigned your rights to

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,530
somebody else the license doesn't apply

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,450
to them they can do what the heck they

00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,720
like with it and you need to be

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,250
concerned about what they do so

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,360
traditionally people have just looked at

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,160
the license of a project and said oh

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,960
that's fine it's a GPL license GPL is a

00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,120
great license I love that that's cool

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,190
we'll go with this project and I like to

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,930
persuade it in fact you need to check

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,040
more than the license of course check

00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,680
the license licensing is really

00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,600
important but also check the snow back

00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,080
doors around it you know there's no I'm

00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,370
I'm the special guy so particularly

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,260
assigning ownerships companies is a

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,270
problem the FSF demands assignments you

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,970
know apache demands a license that's

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,440
like assignment and i will say copyright

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,660
assignment by mistake sometimes what I

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,420
really mean is allowing a single

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,850
corporate entity to have an ownership

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,290
like right so there's many ways you can

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,850
do that you can do it without assignment

00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,650
if you're if you're a big company you

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,840
can say give us your code under a very

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,640
liberal license and we'll give you our

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,440
code under a much more restrictive

00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,330
license then they have a special

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,960
ownership right it's it's pretty much

00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,130
the same thing so you know you see these

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,930
these words in these licenses a

00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,790
perpetual irrevocable worldwide no

00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,680
charred royalty-free under stranded bend

00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:44,020
over might choose the angle this sort of

00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,970
thing you know licenses why should I

00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,620
care well yeah it's good to care about

00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,500
licenses but I think the problem is that

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,360
other people work in an ecosystem with

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,650
you and so you get the license which is

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,830
what matters to you but other people

00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:59,140
also can get a license a special license

00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,870
from the person owns the rights and that

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,490
is what creates a huge problem so it

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,560
creates this barrier of entry and delay

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,330
in conflict it creates conflict because

00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,400
isn't there's a property that's owned

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,380
specially by someone when you have this

00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,300
kind of thing you get conflict I'm sorry

00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,250
you have armies and Wars and locks and

00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,740
you know it's done but you know why do

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,090
houses have locks on the front door if

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,770
everyone in the house there wouldn't be

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,890
perhaps anyway I'm not a complete

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:25,870
communist but anyhow it also creates a

00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,250
barrier of delay and entry so you

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,600
actually have to sign something in many

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,310
jurisdictions and actually either post

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,270
it or fax it to get it to the other side

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,070
see you talking

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,620
you know several days if you're not

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,930
lucky but also ain't much more

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,470
concerning you for us it disrupts quite

00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:43,030
a delicate hacker suit balance so I like

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,340
businesspeople and I have to report to

00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,480
them but there comes a certain strata in

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,820
a company where you're totally

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,110
disconnected from any of us you don't

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,010
know who's done you a favor you don't

00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,840
know what company is really you're

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,220
working with you want money that's what

00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,340
you're there for right money it's all

00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,390
about money and luckily in most of the

00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,860
world's there are people at the bottom

00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,750
who say well you can do that dumb thing

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,030
but then no one will do it with us you

00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,980
know they'll all run away and screaming

00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,180
and so there's this nice tension whereby

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,850
hopefully the people who bottom have

00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,860
some power but unfortunately when

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,090
there's an ownership property issue here

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,800
you get a whole lid of lawyers and

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,990
business people starting to say what you

00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,260
can and can't do in your free software

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,940
project which is really really unhelpful

00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,800
but certainly it excludes competitors if

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,540
you want a dynamic project with lots and

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,610
lots of different companies contributing

00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,160
effectively to it not just little ports

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,630
the benefit just them but actually

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,000
investing in the project you really want

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,140
something that includes competitors does

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,030
your licensing set up does your

00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,310
ownership structure allow people to

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,250
compete with you this is a great test of

00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:45,250
whether you got it right if it doesn't

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:46,840
then you have a problem so try try and

00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,460
look for that maybe one day your project

00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,950
will succeed and you'll want to start a

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,500
company and you know working it is the

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,360
structure there I think perhaps worst

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,800
for me it creates fad around free

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,450
software licensing and practices so

00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,000
people say oh well you can't trust the

00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,310
license so you better assign us rights

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,300
and we'll look after things for you you

00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:08,380
know let's see so the delay in conflict

00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,560
there's some really good papers on this

00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,350
the top example is well-known XE max

00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,850
versus Emacs interestingly a champion of

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,290
assigning rights to some of that stage

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,060
wouldn't assign rights even to the FSF

00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:21,280
into the shame sometimes some people

00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,390
think this is a bad thing more

00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,710
interestingly perhaps is a very good

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:27,700
paper call the best of strangers who has

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:30,130
read the paper the best of strangers no

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,510
one perfect ok so when I published my

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,190
slides can click on the link it's really

00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,870
really fascinating basically it tells

00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,330
you why you shouldn't have legal art

00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,250
legalese on facebook why this shouldn't

00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,420
be a click-through eula why there

00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,240
shouldn't be any of those things because

00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,800
as soon as you do that people will not

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,100
give you information their expectation

00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,490
approve

00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,990
see is triggered by this this sort of

00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,490
thing so they did a study and first of

00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,049
all they ask these people all these

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,549
questions you know what's your name your

00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:56,380
age where you live what your parents

00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:57,460
call their maiden names and then they

00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,830
start on you know when was your first

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,660
sexual encounter do you like you know

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,940
the Christians get increasingly risque

00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,620
and they throw all of the answers away

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,980
and they only record the answer where

00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,840
you stop right so this gives you some

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,970
idea of how your expectation of privacy

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,860
and so they did that for a whole lot of

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,650
students on a university website and

00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,059
they got the number right and then they

00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,559
did this exactly the same study exactly

00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:22,570
the same questions but first they put up

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,850
a great blurb saying your data is safe

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,679
it has been encrypted with 100 and

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,059
million bit encryption none of the

00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:29,740
results will be shared with anyone the

00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:32,220
data will be burnt after you sit will

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,909
bow or all of these reassurances right

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,789
what do you think I'm to the privacy

00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:39,669
school no one went into anything in this

00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:40,929
form at all you know I'm much lower so

00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:44,080
then they tried it again with you know

00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:45,880
demon calm how bad are you at a random

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,650
site on the Internet you know somewhere

00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,059
else and people there was no limit to

00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,380
what people are willing to fill in the

00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:52,720
questions and go far enough you know the

00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,400
scores were maxing out which is

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,690
interesting in itself right i mean so

00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,799
this is why facebook's eula which you

00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,080
should read incidentally because it

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,940
makes a difference is you know i'm not

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,380
shame to you clearly and in fact is

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,669
designed to drive away people that care

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,840
about privacy because they only create

00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:09,130
problems right um arguably but that the

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,080
problem is that if as soon as you engage

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,460
with the project you get this huge you

00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,470
know this assignment perpetual

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:17,500
irrevocable and reversible worldwide

00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:18,760
whatever what happens well you don't

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,919
need to be a rocket scientist to apply

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,659
the paper i think i think we value your

00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:23,890
contributions and hence do not require

00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,480
copyright sighing this is a very

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,370
succinct pithy statement for learners

00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,659
that i happen to like i'm actually your

00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,190
contributions are valuable whether we

00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:33,220
own them or not and we want to make

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,419
people so i think i talked about this i

00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,669
don't want to get too bogged down in

00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:38,799
these slides because they're not that

00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:41,380
interesting generally i think this is

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,240
this is perhaps particularly important I

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,039
work in an ecosystem with redhat guys

00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,870
who I love you know they're just

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,490
fantastic i I work with some of the best

00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,110
programmers in the world in my company

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,780
and also invest burglars the world in

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,010
theirs and we don't fight over business

00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,770
how about if you move up our company's

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,630
towards the top there's a whole sales

00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,700
organization and a fight

00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,780
public organization the go out there and

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,220
persuade people that you should

00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,720
passionately you should definitely buy

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,180
our product and not their product their

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,860
product just sucks I mean I losers right

00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,360
into something and so you know they're

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,590
the two salesmen arrive and do pitch

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,580
warfare in the customer count and

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,470
eventually they buy one or the other

00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,130
right the problem is when you start

00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:19,450
owning code and the code becomes ours

00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,580
what happens in this pitch warfare gives

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,410
more like our but this is our code we

00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,510
own this we should another guy gets on

00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,100
that sucks we should own some code you

00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,040
know like why don't we own it you know

00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,570
okay the pitched warfare unfortunately

00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,550
of all this mess out there gets imported

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,860
into our world where we don't want it

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:38,320
we've really don't want it it's really

00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,880
really done and worse than that pitched

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,590
warfare it then extends into other

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,360
technical decisions you know what

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,100
technology should we use but this

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,770
technology is kind of nav why don't we

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,230
use that technology oh they own that

00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,280
technology we own this neff technology

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,590
but we're going to make it better this

00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,450
is our swamp we are going to build the

00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,940
house in our swamp it's ours you know

00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:01,170
and and just it just imports a whole

00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,400
load of inter-corporate conflict and

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,750
also gets rid of transparency because

00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,400
the agreements that happen behind the

00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,380
scenes to allow one company to have

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,440
another company's code are confidential

00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,820
non transparent and so on and software

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,680
patents pay into this play into this

00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,360
unfortunately and so you get these I

00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,980
know nothing about this project and this

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,870
slide may be entirely wrong that's

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,250
that's my caveat but just think it

00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,370
through with me you get these apparently

00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:27,010
open source projects open spark great

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,590
it's gplv2 licensed and it's got a

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,390
sharing contributor agreement if you

00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,770
want to take things from people it's

00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,840
important you call the process sharing

00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:36,880
or joint or something like that you know

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,020
it sounds good um one contributes to

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,570
open spark this is a direct quote from

00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,380
their website to represent the code base

00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:46,660
and to give the community flexibility

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,670
yeah well so i don't know i'm not in

00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,320
software i'm not in hardware luckily so

00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,350
i can say this but it seems to me that

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,370
has been some patents filed on

00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:58,150
microprocessor architecture in the last

00:30:54,370 --> 00:31:00,430
20 years and maybe that's just me I mean

00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,020
I I suspect there has been so you can

00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,460
you can use their code under this

00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,560
license that means that you can't make

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,410
hardware without being sued to death not

00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,790
by them but by everyone else so that

00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,110
would be fine you know I mean you know

00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,310
you can be sued to death by everyone

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,200
that isn't distributing

00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:17,530
open spark which is going to be all the

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,030
competitors um or you can just safely

00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,470
license from Oracle and pretend to be a

00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,730
no in an open community but actually

00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,280
have behind-the-scenes licensing

00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,810
agreement so I think it's wonderful to

00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,120
have free software it's wonderful to

00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,470
have it under the GPL there's nothing

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,710
wrong with a license it's not the

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:34,300
license that's the problem here it's the

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,680
asymmetric relationship that drives

00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,720
people behind the scenes to seek

00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:42,070
proprietary licenses which are bad

00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,720
here's another example you know GPL

00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,670
makes everyone in it together but here

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,040
is the the public face that we actually

00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,480
know about and it's simplified of the

00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,120
patent wars in the mobile space in the

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,010
moment it's good isn't it I don't know I

00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,590
just I I should update it I'm sure

00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:58,180
there's some more arrows um but the

00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,160
problem is if one of these players comes

00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:02,050
to you and says hey use our technology

00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,120
it's really cool you know if someone

00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:08,370
comes this is use our technology oh it's

00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:10,360
l gplv3 like L GPL license whatever um

00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:12,460
that sounds like a good deal right

00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,960
you're getting the lgpl it's emotionally

00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,130
for mu license so you doing but the

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,390
problem is if there's any patent

00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,420
infringement in it they're the only

00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,820
people are can settle our nakia or Apple

00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,310
or HTC right the actual owner of the

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,050
code so they have this this they're not

00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,430
in it with you then are in it together

00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:30,310
with you they have these special rights

00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,360
and so yeah sure if you're friends with

00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,970
them today you could build your

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,350
technology stack on their technology

00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,670
okay let's hope it doesn't infringe a

00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,200
patent oh and by the way they don't care

00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,790
if it infringes the patent because they

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,680
can settle so they actually have no

00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,600
incentive to be in it with you and

00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,000
actually help make this clean and safe

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,680
for everyone so it's just excessively

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,060
dangerous and there's some really good

00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,660
examples that I'm I won't bore you more

00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:54,370
with us um open call special indemnity

00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,990
in open court allows you to have a

00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:58,060
special indemnity that others can't get

00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:00,040
cuz read Hatton the vel offer indemnity

00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,480
for all of you guys code well maybe not

00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,340
all of it but if we're shipping it you

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,020
know will offer indemnity for it because

00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,730
it's the right thing to do some people

00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,590
have that concern but there's special

00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,180
indemnity how can you have a special

00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,580
indenting well if you own the code oh

00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,410
you can have other funky licenses behind

00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,900
the scenes and this is part of what's

00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,610
driving this thing called open call and

00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,860
how do you market an indemnity product

00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,420
like this now will you go around scaring

00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,710
people and saying the license isn't good

00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,840
enough you're not protected there are

00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,480
probably problems in it and

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,190
we hear this happening why is that the

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,390
Java is not on your phone with a free

00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,659
software license rather than a

00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,340
proprietary one you tell me what's on

00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:38,919
that there's all sorts of fud around the

00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,570
place so people typically don't choose a

00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,919
plus license because they're terribly

00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,500
scared of what the FSF will do next

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,000
right it could like I don't know at some

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,309
terrible tools so what they do is they

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,529
choose a non plus license which makes no

00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:52,419
sense at all unless you own the code if

00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:54,309
you own the code of course you can move

00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:55,929
to another license at your choice in

00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:58,270
choosing and not when the community

00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:59,890
chooses so you know you have control but

00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,929
you know these great arguments are well

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:04,330
but we need copyright assignment so that

00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:05,500
we can move to the next license she'd

00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,390
only copyright cycle that just choose a

00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,820
plus license using MKL if you

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,609
particularly need to use the GPL use a

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:15,310
CD dl even if you well I use the MPL v2

00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:16,780
let's say um and suggest cheers cheers

00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,879
Cheers a license allows you to do that

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,399
with the community and try control him

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,139
um and people like Apache sadly if

00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:25,149
Apache had a plus licensing clause we

00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:27,010
would see very many fewer clas today I

00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:28,419
think because that's what they used

00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,710
their ownership right for an Apache use

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:32,080
to basically move to the next license

00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,669
but they didn't leave that there's a

00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,300
standing chestnut there where people say

00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:40,510
oh well but we can't defend the code but

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,980
it's just rubbish basically and then

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,050
there's all this other fudge around the

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,270
license that says deep you know in this

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:48,700
weird country with this extraordinary

00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,320
broken law it's absolutely vital that we

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,540
have a copyright sound because you can't

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,679
write free software alright well yeah

00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,750
but you know in some countries you can't

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,609
even speak without being beaten to death

00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:59,080
you know I mean lately you know we can't

00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,089
adapt everything that we do to these

00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,430
other companies broken jurisdictions

00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:04,930
right that they need to fix their law so

00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,780
that actually we can write free software

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:09,880
why should we compromise the safety and

00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,760
integrity of what we do to meet some

00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,650
random jurisdictions problems so there

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,609
we go there's a lot of fun but actually

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,400
we do have a contribution agreement

00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:20,470
every contribution is under the license

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,119
that we use and it's a beautiful unfair

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,230
symmetry the inbound agreement the

00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,060
contribution agreement is the same as

00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,950
the outbound it's the same license now

00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,810
I'm not a lawyer so ignore everything i

00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,790
said but listen to Richard Fontana who's

00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:33,190
worked for the sflc and now works for

00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,630
Red Hat and he's got a great talk on I

00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,030
gonna read the slides they're here about

00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,920
project harmony which is in this area

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,609
and he says these bullet points

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,319
basically

00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:43,749
the legal benefits of greater control

00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:46,630
there are some legal benefits are

00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:48,789
sufficiently dubious to not justify the

00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,739
harm done to the community by copyright

00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:52,720
assignment okay well that's a great

00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:54,220
quote what about contributor agreement

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,779
seems to suggest that free software

00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,670
licenses are not good enough for the

00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:59,799
model this is a lawyer talking regular

00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,509
loser you know the ethical concerns

00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:03,039
involved in terms the unequal bug yeah

00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:04,749
so I've done my bit on contributor

00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,720
agreements there are some other things

00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:11,739
in the slides blah blah blah fired about

00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,749
its applied blah blah blah blah blah

00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:14,920
okay the trend is away from it read the

00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:16,690
kinome guidelines on copyright

00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,190
assignment they're really good redhats

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,019
dismantling their a site copyright

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,390
assignment agreements niveles drops done

00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:23,920
I left and right Revolution the loads of

00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,470
projects failed that tried this in the

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,660
past so this is non use so we need your

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:33,249
help I have five minutes left of talking

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:34,839
in 10 minutes of questions so so this is

00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:35,950
just a random new feature I keep trying

00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:37,569
to put the message across that we

00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,130
actually have new features we're not

00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:41,950
just the same RvB a support is much

00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,269
better so they get you love vba right

00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,710
did i mention that we have every

00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:47,049
programming language so almost whatever

00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:49,029
you program in there's something good to

00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:52,180
do in LibreOffice you know that's cool

00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:55,960
so anyhow can you mirror you know it's a

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,640
plus huh yeah anyway so can you mirror

00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,809
will translate well mirror mirror admins

00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,069
we have something for you there's a

00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:01,509
great mailing list here if you if you

00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:02,920
have a machine and a great fat bandwidth

00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:04,630
connection i know some of your sis

00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,549
happens here I know you guys creep in

00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:08,920
everywhere um and hold the world

00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:10,989
together um so we're small you know

00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,119
we're only 11 gigabytes for release it's

00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:14,950
ridiculous isn't it um it's much too big

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,619
we're going to make it a lot smaller but

00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:20,019
the alternative is 76 gigabytes you know

00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:21,789
so you know switch today mirror us

00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:23,799
instead and you're free up 65 gig on

00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:25,599
your server that's good and it turns out

00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:29,410
that the the the downloads on the other

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,749
side are only 160 146 meg and we are 200

00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,549
and 200 max so we seen bigger but the

00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:36,039
reality is that if it's 200 Meg out of

00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:38,230
76 gig so she's slower to download I

00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:40,539
have people saying i downloaded in 30

00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,390
seconds you know 30 second download of

00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:45,759
210 okay so this is not characteristic i

00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:47,259
would say but but nevertheless you know

00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:49,450
being able to distribute these builds

00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:50,890
much more quickly everywhere and making

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,820
the small and having a bigger mirror

00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,920
system is brilliant and we've got

00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,750
fifty-plus mirrors but we'd love more

00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,490
it's always good to have the guy in next

00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,380
door to you in the next room so you

00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:02,210
actually get that 30-second download so

00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,130
you can update and sprint translators

00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,200
yeah we have a no language favoritism

00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:08,810
policy so we bundle all of our languages

00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,700
we split the help out so it's separate

00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,140
you have online help but if you have an

00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,480
active translation and you have good

00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,740
good coverage and you know you're you're

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,170
working hard you will be in the default

00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,730
install so if you speak up a side luteum

00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,650
someone came and told me they were from

00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,510
up asylees or after I'd given this to

00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:25,850
last night I'm sure it's a great place

00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,530
um but you know we can get your language

00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:29,420
in if it's Welsh or whatever will ship

00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,250
it by default it's actually very small

00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,380
translation so we're working to make

00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,850
them smaller and what's more than that

00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,410
we do quick releases we do monthly

00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,850
releases and we'll back pour your

00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,800
translation to the stable branch so

00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,840
you'll see it in a month actually in a

00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,880
shipping product so that's cool now

00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,920
here's another nice feature Microsoft

00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,900
Works file you shouldn't be using them

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,940
but we can luckily convert them to ODF

00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,500
that's all these are distinctive

00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,890
features you'll find in LibreOffice only

00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,240
can you program we don't need ultra what

00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,620
we do need ultra elite programmers

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,420
actually we have some big heavy lifting

00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,070
tasks we need but there are plenty of

00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,470
entry-level problems it turns out that

00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:05,900
superstar hackers start by doing easy

00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,070
things first so we'd love you to start

00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,660
in our project and become a superstar

00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,730
hacker that would be cool you know we

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,680
want to go change the world and we've

00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,450
plenty of level entry level problems we

00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,610
have this easy hacks page and like you

00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,720
know some of them just simple removing

00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,520
pointless comments you don't need to be

00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,170
a programmer to do this and it's useful

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,810
it is actually useful to have clean the

00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,040
code just requires some simple brain and

00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:28,280
I'm fortune when I was young I learned

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,990
programming by typing in basic games you

00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,330
know the magazines used to come with

00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:34,730
type in program I see some older heads

00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:36,260
nodding here unfortunately typing in

00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:40,130
program you know begins there's no

00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,900
longer a growth industry but if you can

00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,550
fix dirty code you can learn to read

00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,800
code and learn the syntax and you get

00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,540
into unit so Gilliland's program but I

00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,040
language you can help with yeah we've

00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,140
have all the languages and leads of

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,630
simple task but or you know interesting

00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:56,270
task too we have for duplicate base64

00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,350
implementations for example I think we

00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,730
just removed one so we only have three

00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,440
now but there's another two to kill

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:05,930
right this is not a complicated thing

00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:09,260
basic spree um uncalled code we have 650

00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:11,600
we're down from 1400 unused known unused

00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,950
methods to only 850 or something but

00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,500
they're still whole load of dead code is

00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,970
never called we know it it can't be CPP

00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,470
check we're running lint tools over it

00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,730
and getting warnings of leaks and

00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,620
crashes and all those things that need

00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:25,670
fixing obsolete macros that are never

00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:27,260
called um yeah multi second sleeps from

00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,820
the queue 80 we have this great q8 all

00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,160
that presses buttons but unfortunately

00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,690
due to race conditions it sleeps almost

00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,250
all the time between every button click

00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,290
in case you know something slow happens

00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:38,150
this is a more advanced programming task

00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:40,130
involving main loop integration and some

00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,770
even some who knows stuff and this be

00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,820
cool this will help us speed things up

00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,930
threading the spreadsheet computation

00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,960
engine this is getting quite advanced

00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:49,160
this is a really interesting problem in

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,340
multi-dimensional dependence season you

00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,660
know it's quite funky writing unit tests

00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,700
stopping the thing waking up constantly

00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,440
and leaking these wake up's they'll chew

00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,570
your battery life let's try a new does

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,980
feature this distinctive styles okay so

00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:02,750
styles we have a style based word

00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,830
processor and it's brilliant it's a

00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,560
clean way of doing things but

00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:08,210
unfortunate makes some things very hard

00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,260
like doing title pages so here this

00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,730
brilliant new feature and this is like

00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,740
one of the number one bugs and writer

00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:14,480
how can you get my title page numbering

00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,310
to work and there's frequently asked

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,450
questions about it and click this and do

00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,070
that in this dialogue and change that

00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:21,110
style in the evening long oh it's so

00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:23,630
goes on we have a dialogue like this

00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:25,370
that does it trivial a again distinctive

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,680
libre office it actually makes it work

00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,750
very easy can you integrate maybe you

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,670
have some web thing everyone has a web

00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:33,020
thing now right you know but your heart

00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,370
is in the fact line you know you want to

00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,560
integrate your content management system

00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,700
don't write some extension and hide it

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,560
somewhere where no one will ever see it

00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,900
get it integrated in LibreOffice and

00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,700
deployed to millions of users so it's

00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,400
just built in it's just a feature that

00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,810
we have there and yeah whatever service

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,150
you have we'd love to do it we'd love to

00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,760
love to get people integrated and you

00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,900
know it's a lesser gplv3 which is sound

00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,850
in some ways but we're competing with

00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,430
Microsoft Office which sadly is

00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,720
everywhere unfortunately well not quite

00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,070
everywhere there are some niches of

00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,810
software freedom that are growing and

00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:05,420
we're growing them but the problem is is

00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,800
DS think Microsoft Office is there they

00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,960
just think it's down so they write

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,400
things for it and we want to change that

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,050
we want to make sure that they can write

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,940
them for us and at least push that stuff

00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,940
out in terms of software freedom

00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,560
strategy so ya know another nice feature

00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:21,380
moving from latest word

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,780
odf that's a good thing to do right who

00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,730
uses Lotus wipro anyway are you German

00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,570
if you're German we have special

00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,890
opportunities for you um but but but

00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:34,160
let's not go there first I see the

00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:37,160
journey excellent anyhow if your

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,360
academic we you know so get involved

00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,250
help us translate the source code it's

00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,930
easy I this is a USB keys with a source

00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,180
code on it at the other desk up there

00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:49,850
and it can be easily you know you can

00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:52,580
you can easily improve things I'm sorry

00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:56,410
you know so what does what say this one

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:59,240
here I ok so this is a German joke

00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:01,670
Germans like it it says everything has

00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:05,420
an end Alice have an Ender only the

00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:10,340
sausage has two so they go anyway and

00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:12,200
they'd say it's an important I don't

00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,390
know maybe it's not anyway let's think

00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,700
about the academic opportunities in in

00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,100
LibreOffice you know actually we are the

00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,480
last large application that believes in

00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,300
component programming you know it's

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,130
amazing can a human KDE both used to

00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,540
believe in abstract component models and

00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,660
they've both got rid of them they just

00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:31,370
have in process C++ now firefox after a

00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,890
great long struggle with its internal

00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:36,410
xpcom wonder has also realized this is

00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,730
just a bunch of waste yeah this k parts

00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,320
but its native c++ right you have

00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:43,490
abstrait interfaces new you just use

00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:45,410
them yeah perfect ok so either way

00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,820
Firefox is dropping its own internal

00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:48,380
component model and rewriting out where

00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,240
the last one that hasn't realized that

00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,010
it's just a total waste of time anyway

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,270
so there's an academic paper to be

00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,670
written here called the death of

00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:56,990
component based software free software

00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,640
is the magic bullet for carries a my

00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:01,550
speakers one who wrote a component model

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:09,350
system and a part of a book on it yes

00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:10,970
okay yes very substantially that's true

00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,830
it's about codifying a contract between

00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:14,960
two things but that's only one of the

00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,820
big problems there are hundreds of you

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,080
know like the confusion of concerns why

00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,120
why didn't we use like a model for

00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,770
thread safety why don't we use utterly

00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,450
generic interfaces so everything turns

00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:25,670
into a single method do something that

00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,840
gets passed an abstract anything and you

00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,310
know your whole code is sort of do

00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,470
something methods so how the heck do you

00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:32,450
find what what's going on you know how

00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:35,060
can you follow the flow of code

00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:36,530
you know it's just it's a disaster from

00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,970
beginning to end but anyway there you

00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:39,619
get it is good for some things like

00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:41,690
scripting bindings but anyway fair

00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:43,640
enough so hopefully we can get academic

00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:45,380
symbols we can get translators

00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,540
programmers Germans oh here's another

00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,369
nice new distinctive feature yeah those

00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,680
WordPerfect files or the legacy now we

00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:53,510
can suck even the images and they've got

00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,369
some weird image meta file format that

00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,930
we now convert nicely and you can save

00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:59,119
those and move them to ODF it's

00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,920
beautiful and if your user you can file

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,140
good bugs with a clear description

00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,480
better than it doesn't work and a test

00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,160
documents that actually is minimal that

00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,200
has just the feature that we need in it

00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,510
and if you do that we can fix the bugs

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,099
much more quickly instead of having

00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:16,369
programmers on whatever programmers earn

00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:18,200
which is what um doing you know chopping

00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:20,150
bug documents chop the bottom half out

00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,890
does it still crash yes excellently was

00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,839
in the top half chop the top half of you

00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,430
know that are in a whittling down this

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,890
document by binary chopped you the one

00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,839
piece that break stuff instead of paying

00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,609
someone fortune to do that this is some

00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,960
way you can really help we have bug

00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:34,849
documents of the huge the break stuff

00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,770
this this is a really good way that

00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:38,690
people with no snow real skill can help

00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,310
but triaging and you know working on

00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:41,510
bugs is great and just downloading and

00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,980
running the latest release candidates

00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:45,109
we're going to have nightly snapshot

00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,819
soon this used to be a distinctive

00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:48,050
feature but then oracle rewrote it

00:45:46,819 --> 00:45:50,810
because they wouldn't accept our code

00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:52,550
under the GPR v3 or the MPL which is a

00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:54,200
shame so what we're working on now we're

00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:56,119
working on scaling growing this thing we

00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,230
have lots of patch review coming in I

00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:59,210
spend a lot of my time reviewing

00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,980
people's patches building our easy hacks

00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,780
trying to mentor people and trying to

00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,760
scale that process so we get more people

00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,530
like I guess like me like quail or

00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,300
lights on the Red Hat guys that can help

00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,880
mentor people and grow this community we

00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,839
love super experience ace free software

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,760
developers that help that process

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,460
because we're getting a lot of people

00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,260
and they need love and help um yeah

00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,700
easier build cross-compilation so we

00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,579
don't have to compile on windows which

00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,630
is a disaster hourly snapshots

00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:25,819
improvements with user interface can we

00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:27,859
make builds making the code suck less

00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:30,200
you know there's lots lots of work there

00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:32,210
we talked about the smaller download

00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,589
footprint so that it's you know we're

00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,930
even smaller week do you think we can be

00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:37,550
smaller and have more features and more

00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:39,470
translations than the competition and

00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:40,640
you know we're moving up we're starting

00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:42,170
at the bottom we're getting the code

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,300
right we're getting the code clean and

00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:45,349
we're moving up to the user interface is

00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,190
starting to change things in the UI

00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:48,110
improve them

00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,660
I think the full blown reef actors and

00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:53,540
new metaphors will come but first let's

00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:56,210
get the foundation stable oh Beautiful

00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:58,250
Mind beautiful beautiful icons yeah

00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:01,790
there's more coming it's kind of a

00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:04,580
contentious because we have a graphic

00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:06,350
design team that likes these an inane oh

00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:09,170
I put two at the same one there are more

00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:14,660
of them why do we choose colors artists

00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:15,920
do that not me but who knows that would

00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,530
be totally irrelevant any of our

00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,690
thinking I row map to the future I say

00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:22,070
we have a release release train so you

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,090
know it's not a blocker bug if you

00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,290
didn't fix it by the time you're

00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,020
released obviously no one cared enough

00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:28,280
about it and we release incrementals

00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,540
stable updates so people need to

00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,520
understand both of these things the

00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:34,280
release train means check the release

00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,330
notes on the point zero release okay so

00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,010
if your enterprise user maybe you don't

00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:38,930
use the point of release although our

00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:41,180
sins very good nice to added relatively

00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,740
bug free um but the point one release

00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:45,920
which is coming out freeze Monday

00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:47,270
release middle of next week is it's

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,160
going to be even better and even better

00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:50,360
on a monthly basis and we're going to

00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,040
synchronize our release plan with the

00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,930
wider free software desktop so we'll

00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,730
release at a time that makes sense to

00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,430
get into your distribution so you get

00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,990
the latest invest office suite and it's

00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,670
pretty rapid fire there's the this thing

00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:04,070
basically we're just going to be a

00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,380
normal free software project so here are

00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:08,660
my conclusions we want to be a big and

00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,550
cool and fun event a neutral and

00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,050
vigorous and turn this thing into

00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:13,610
something that kicks ass like you

00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:16,310
wouldn't believe now I think we can do

00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:18,320
it with your help we're going to be

00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,640
ungrateful to corporate control projects

00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,130
actually if you have a corporate control

00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,170
project it's not fair to say oh but that

00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:26,000
company they invest so much they're

00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:28,760
doing almost all the work in the project

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,850
isn't only fair that they have copyright

00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,680
assigned to them they so what this is

00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:35,450
totally broken they're the only one

00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,070
doing all the work in the project this

00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,810
is ridiculous it should be a wide open

00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:40,790
community full of people contributing

00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:42,620
this is a weakness how can we have this

00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:44,600
one person controlling it it could fail

00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,250
that company could do something dumb we

00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,350
need to be ungrateful and positively

00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:51,680
discriminate in favor of projects that

00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:55,190
are actually proper community projects

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,310
so postgres iced tea and a libreoffice

00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:59,630
encourage you to use these projects

00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,410
libre office also has a

00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,300
you know you can strike a

00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:03,920
disproportionate low for freedom here we

00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,240
have loads of users we have a

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,000
hundred-million-dollar user base to

00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,380
cannibalize most of it on windows we

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,270
love you guys to help us in that process

00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,520
and we want to grow that we think we can

00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:15,080
go two three four times as many as that

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,520
without much difficulty and we want to

00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,450
get people excited about free software

00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,920
you don't want your friends be

00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,300
embarrassed you don't want them to have

00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,400
crashing bugs you want them to say this

00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,280
LibreOffice thing is cool it really

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,720
works it's stable it's sexy wow it does

00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,910
this thing I just discovered you know oh

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,530
you can't do that in the alternative

00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:31,940
Microsoft world look look isn't this

00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,440
cool that's where we want to be we want

00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,910
to have a cool project people get

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,710
excited with and the way to get there is

00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:39,230
just try an easy hack get stuck you know

00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:41,330
put one hand the other hand foot and let

00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:42,800
you know get stuck in and thanks for

00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:44,630
helping support we would be nowhere if

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,310
it was not for people like you helping

00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:48,560
us supporting us and we really rely on

00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:50,060
you you know we're betting a lot the

00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,430
LibreOffice will demonstrate the power

00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:54,710
of freedom and openness to change

00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:56,990
software projects and of course to

00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:59,470
change the world so please help us do

00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:59,470
that thang

00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:14,109
well thank you we've got time for two or

00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:16,299
three questions meanwhile I would like

00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:18,549
to ask the next week to already step up

00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:21,160
to the desk any questions questions

00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:22,119
questions oh we have stickers as well so

00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,499
these one of your people are going to

00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:25,059
run up giving you stickers in case you

00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:26,670
don't have them your laptop's this

00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:39,279
equation I'll promote LibreOffice ah

00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:41,769
gentlemen ah hello and do you have any

00:50:39,279 --> 00:50:43,539
plans well do do you have any plans

00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:45,730
related with accessibility with

00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:48,400
LibreOffice do we have accessibility

00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:51,400
plans future plans to improve Texas with

00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,680
report on LibreOffice yes on Linux yeah

00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,630
yeah so I personally wrote at least half

00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,549
of the accessibility bridge for linux

00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,960
that allows you to use the native

00:50:57,549 --> 00:51:00,640
accessibility stuff instead of go to

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,319
java and then to the native stuff and

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,269
we've done quite a lot of work to

00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,099
improve that so yes it's not perfect we

00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:09,130
would love your help it's not a lot of

00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:10,599
code it's like a 500 500 thousand lines

00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:13,960
of code does the whole accessibility

00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:16,809
bridge five hundred to a thousand you

00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:19,239
know it's a talisman why they mean

00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:21,249
future work i'll relate together sweetie

00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:24,069
because I mean that you have to talking

00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:26,589
about the current support that Larry up

00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:29,579
his class right oh you are I mean I am

00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:32,170
asking about future plans about toxicity

00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:33,730
so I didn't hear any of that but we have

00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,989
a great accessibility story asked me in

00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:39,609
the end is there anyone else that has a

00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:42,789
question quickly I'm sorry I mean scare

00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:45,880
you off I just couldn't hear so I want

00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:48,099
you if you could have a question did no

00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:53,230
more questions perfect well okay so just

00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:55,390
one here no I'd nearly escaped are there

00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:57,069
any plans to improve the build my laptop

00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:59,559
needed six hours to compile the whole

00:51:57,069 --> 00:52:01,509
thing yes so it turns out that this is

00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:02,739
not our fault the c++ compiler should

00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:05,140
compile instantly right you know

00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:06,759
everyone knows that um so yes we have a

00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,859
lot of code we're reducing the amount of

00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:11,499
bloats you know so it compiles quicker

00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:13,509
but we have a better build system

00:52:11,499 --> 00:52:14,710
actually being done my Oracle although

00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:18,309
the guy doing that is now working for

00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:19,960
canonical so so we will have a faster

00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:20,140
bill to a parallel is much better but at

00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,280
the

00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,430
the day if you're compiling a million

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,320
lines of c++ c plus plus i add it's

00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:30,520
going to take a while so we're trying

00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:33,820
thank you cool maybe one more last

00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,290
question oh so based on your comments

00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,570
are would you characterize the business

00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:40,870
model of masculine cutie when they were

00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:43,780
dual licensed as a narrative bad can I

00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:47,380
can I say what about them based on your

00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,700
comments about contributor agreements

00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:51,820
yes would you consider the business

00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:54,580
model of MySQL and QT up dual licensing

00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:57,040
yes so I didn't mention those things by

00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:58,900
name but you'll notice but I think you

00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,480
need to think very carefully about dual

00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:03,370
licensing business models I think there

00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,630
are acceptable ways to do dual license

00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:07,120
business models and if you read the

00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:09,010
genome contribution agreements it

00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,260
codifies the kind of things the help

00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:13,420
protect against the worst excesses here

00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,860
so there are ways of making sure that

00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:19,090
those companies are in it together with

00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:20,560
us still but I have not seen one yet I'm

00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,690
not seen a contribution agreement that

00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:25,180
actually does that so yes be very

00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:26,920
careful and I speak as one with some

00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,360
experience here are being a massive

00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:32,260
advocate of contribute agreements and

00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:34,860
now being wise up so thank you alright

00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,860
well thanks again

00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,030
