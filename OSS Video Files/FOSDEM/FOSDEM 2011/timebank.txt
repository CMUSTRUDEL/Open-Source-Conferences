I

00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,520
you

00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,830
and

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:19,779
the origins well first ethical can is

00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:23,020
the creator of the mother time bank idea

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:27,340
his he was working in social services

00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:31,890
for a lot of time and he wanting to

00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:35,680
improve the how the organization's of

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:39,550
social services organizations work and

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:43,180
he not assist noticed that they work in

00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:46,570
a deficit based approach to social

00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,960
services in which DC people in the

00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:52,629
chance of the you need into instead of

00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,859
the in terms of the what they can

00:00:52,629 --> 00:01:02,589
provide and what can they apply to

00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:05,290
themselves so the idea is that everyone

00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:07,870
can contribute like just like in open

00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:13,380
source and this can foster the community

00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:17,260
and it's it's sad that many people

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:22,750
didn't didn't even asked for the chat

00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:27,250
next door for even a bit of sugar and so

00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:30,250
in 1980 him coins are invented the idea

00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,920
of time man keen so what's this thing

00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,970
and talking about what is really simple

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:40,450
it's just to be been able to exchange

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,540
services using China's currency so and

00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:47,530
and that's how what the time bank opens

00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:50,740
free software project is about and you

00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:53,770
don't even do the need to to think that

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,470
is this is going to to be another

00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:02,010
currency you're not instead of using

00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:07,200
money using time but it is just a way to

00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:10,780
didn't demise the the the way an

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,690
organization works you use the time so

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:18,310
that everyone can contribute to to the

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:21,010
community equally and and it this can

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,810
can be used not only for social services

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,660
but

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,319
for any kind of organization for example

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:32,890
we are going to use the this software in

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:37,360
in our local you local linux user group

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:39,760
in seville where I come from and the

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,650
thing is that for social services the

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,709
idea main idea was that lots of people

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:48,670
don't have lots of money but they have

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:53,950
time and a lot of time in their hands

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:56,230
and they they know how to do how to do

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,430
things they know for example they can

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:02,019
provide service a lot of a lot of

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,510
services for example they can help you

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:08,200
with your cooking if you are not very

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:11,950
good like other good cooker like me or

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,920
if you are a computer a computer person

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:19,510
you can help them with the day with a

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:24,430
computer or you can fix the the bike if

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:29,470
he is not working or even you can

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:34,209
exchange the time for trans transport ok

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:36,790
not a taxi where you pay money where you

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:40,709
pay money for the transport that just a

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:45,640
change time one people one person can

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:48,489
give you right and another will maybe

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,049
give you some classes of cooking and

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,370
then you will fix the computer of

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:57,760
another person so this this is working

00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,639
for local communities of people who work

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:08,380
together and know each other this is the

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:13,540
main the main idea son data well they're

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:15,850
more than 100 active time banks in UK 53

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,989
officially recognized time bank in USA

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:23,260
as I said earlier there this idea came

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:27,970
back from the 80s and now that we are in

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:31,960
the economic Chris it creases is coming

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:35,000
back and a bit out of the play the sofa

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:39,350
pry it well this is the

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,680
the main page of a time bank using the

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,520
software we've developed it's just lists

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:51,560
lists the services some news it's lat

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:55,040
actually it's a it's a social web page

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,810
and the updater of the allow the

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,970
technical details while it's written in

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:04,280
general in python python is it was first

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,620
localization is translated to spanish

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,960
and english and actually also to spanish

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:14,840
with natural gender for that place

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,650
migrations we suppose all we use self

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,530
and is even tested with sqlite I'm

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,270
posterous and for dependencies for in

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,419
solid the dependencies of this software

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:30,710
we use built all and for those who use

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:34,700
jungle pipe Python might know what was

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:37,700
that then our idea is that it must be

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:41,660
easy to use and deploy easy to use

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:47,410
because the people working well the

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:47,410
people that you can use the dis offer

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:54,260
maybe they are all typically they're all

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,169
because in social services there are

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,060
lots of a lot of the people that in

00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:04,220
these communities are older and they are

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:06,710
not compute computer wise and and it

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,860
needs to be easy really easy to use but

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,919
also if you have a small organization

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,550
you typically done don't have a computer

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:18,860
person that can help with with the

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:25,450
software so it needs to be really easy

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:28,810
to deploy and for doing that we we use a

00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:31,610
well we we use the technology I

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,120
mentioned earlier and the status of the

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:37,930
project is that in January last last

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,360
month we released the first version and

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:44,060
this week this week we have released the

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,599
next version 101 and is completely

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,800
functional and well we have already two

00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:50,629
organizations

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,909
in in the south of Spain using this

00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:58,849
software and many more come in because

00:06:54,909 --> 00:07:02,330
there are lots of interest with having a

00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:06,229
software that works because there are

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,440
other projects that that provides time

00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:13,220
banking but they are either not well

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,409
known or all then no really working and

00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:19,190
we want to have a good community we have

00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:23,629
a mail list user list weeki track we

00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:27,860
used it for development and well because

00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:32,419
as I said organizations they don't know

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:35,810
a lot about computers either we provide

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:37,610
the service to create your own time bank

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,319
just like you can create your own

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,379
WordPress well you can create your own

00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:45,710
time Mac but as we have in what double

00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:50,710
mag and company we have that we are

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:54,680
developing this over in watauga we have

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:58,569
limited resources because of that we

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,270
only can provide the the free service to

00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:04,250
some nonprofit organizations but if you

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,099
want you can request your runtime

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,169
mankind will we will study your case or

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:11,060
you've caught you can do love the code

00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:14,690
and install you eating in your servers

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,960
and we will if you are asking ask us in

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:21,379
the mail list we can help euros your

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,779
problems of course for most hype most

00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:26,779
services like custom development and

00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:30,229
hosting and deployment in support for a

00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:33,740
bit of money we can we can give you all

00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:37,010
this kind of services future of the

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:40,699
allotment we have we are thinking about

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:45,410
adding plugin support so it's easier to

00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:49,130
extend the the software and for example

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,890
one idea is that is to create a time

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:55,850
banks only for transport that's one of

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:58,699
our our diaz and then it a lot more of

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,040
ideas that are coming so we might

00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:03,220
develop it

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:08,459
I'm going to do a bit of a demo if

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:11,079
possible and I'm going to use the the

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:14,620
demo time man that we have in our

00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:18,130
service this is the web page and a half

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:25,509
for example i'm going to show the admin

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:30,459
user log in here or is in spanish i'm

00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:34,149
going to put it in English ok so here we

00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:36,519
see a photo of me and the list of

00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:40,680
services I at this moment there's only

00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,389
one service in in this demo server and

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,389
because I'm an administrator I have more

00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:51,940
touch like this one here I can see all

00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:57,220
the people that are in this server and I

00:09:51,940 --> 00:10:01,209
can locate all the people click click

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:05,019
here and see the profile all the

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:10,540
information i can write a message to

00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:12,279
this person if i want and of course view

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,920
his services but his know providing

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,839
anyone so for example if i want to

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:22,000
create a new service I clicking here in

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:27,250
service services and create a new

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,480
service and then I oops here it's not

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:34,170
this one is not translated and and I can

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:41,740
create a new service for example I can

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:44,439
help you with your cooking and on well

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,230
with you cooking and I can choose a

00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:51,910
category because the there are

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:56,110
categories for for the services but in

00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:59,740
the server i have only one the area you

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,630
might have multiple areas if you have an

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,630
organization that is bigger and it's in

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,519
a city for you could provide only your

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,490
service to one part of the city you

00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:12,959
don't want to move and it could be

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,959
either an offer on a demand

00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:24,040
so my service is already created and now

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,880
I have these two services now for

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:35,830
example another and in another browser I

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:38,230
can list the services here and request

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:41,170
well send a message to this person that

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,260
is offering us a service and talk with

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:47,500
hand say okay what kind of cooking do

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:55,810
you know when can we meet everything

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:58,390
some message here man can meet so it's

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:03,670
kind of really we're trying to make it

00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:06,360
really easy to use and now if I I go to

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:11,890
the other browser where is the I mean

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:15,690
the main user locket locked and i click

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:20,970
anywhere now I have one I have 1 message

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:24,850
okay and then finally I might I might

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:30,100
finally request the service well this

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:33,970
one is in Spanish also i finally kind of

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:38,650
requests requests the service some

downloaded the software here and have it

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:24,760
has an install document and it's really

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,990
easy to install you just need python and

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:31,860
then execute this common here set up and

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:36,060
it downloads all the dependencies

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:40,180
locally in the in this directory then

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:42,190

securities comments or sam being

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:50,340

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:54,250
walk in and then install the database

00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:56,550
lot the the sample data and then run the

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,530
