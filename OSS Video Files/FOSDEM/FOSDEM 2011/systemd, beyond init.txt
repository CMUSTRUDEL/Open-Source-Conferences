systemd is a system and session manager for Linux, compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.

Wow, what a paragraph! In case I lost you half-way: in our presentation I hope to explain in a lot more detail what systemd is really about, and parse with you the paragraph in a way that is hopefully more understandable.

Both the Fedora and OpenSUSE distributions (and many others, too) are working on making systemd the default init system in their next releases. Since the init system is a core part of the operating system and systemd a major change that will impact what we consider a Linux system quite a bit this talk should be interesting to all developers, administrators and users alike.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org
