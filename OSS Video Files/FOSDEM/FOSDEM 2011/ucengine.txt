you

00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:20,400
hello I'm Roman go Jay and I were 4 AF

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,670
83 and I'm you see engine core developer

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,340
so i will show watches you see engine

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,170
and on what kind of thing you can do

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,930
with it use engine is a

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:36,059
publish-subscribe server clients push

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,360
events to the server which has

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,600
dispatched to other clients it's allows

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,129
you to build valentime applications such

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,769
as collaborative budget services games

00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:55,140
live meetings or anything else that fits

00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:59,400
in the even driven filter philosophy but

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:03,330
what what makes you say engine different

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:07,130
from others is its persistence ability

00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:10,979
its native persistence every advance

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:14,310
pushed to the server is stirred and time

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:19,710
coded so you can finally search for

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:24,479
events for example you can specify a

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:28,219
temporal frame or specific type of event

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,530
or retrieval this kind of native ability

00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:38,249
allow you to think our features like

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:41,340
replay use engine is will to be

00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:45,719
developer friendly so we will try to

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:50,219
keep things simple we have reached a

00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:54,420
REST API on top of an errand curl which

00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:58,920
design is a primary action format and as

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:04,289
its http-based it's simple on you have

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:07,319
tons of library to play with so you're

00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:11,610
not not tied to a specific language

00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:14,150
because your engine has been designed to

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:18,420
be technologic at mystic and

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:21,239
interoperable so you can use the

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,390
roadways you want to play to play with

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,390
it

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:35,080
most of your code will run server side

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,050
most of the time because for the moment

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,370
we have to buy new libraries or will be

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:45,870
one and in JavaScript one which is a

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:49,050
focused on the browser interaction and

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,330
there is no intermediate between the

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:56,590
JavaScript library the rock cod archeron

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:59,620
learning cut client-side on the servers

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,140
are using engine server but sometimes

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:07,470
there is some some things you can do

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,470
with the brother for example there is a

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:16,780
convention of PDF to images that you can

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:21,040
do with JavaScript API Wizards having a

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,860
client-side logic so 12 this you write

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:30,400
the demon clients in allison language to

00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:33,400
speak with it a new song join jee main

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,550
client is what we call a brick a process

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:44,410
certain least that needs to be alone to

00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:47,980
do a specific things ok setting with a

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:51,460
classic the chat example let's imagine

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,850
you want to charge with a friend but you

00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,940
know how do you manage to do to do this

00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,400
with us engine it should not be more

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,700
difficult that send an even to your

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:08,020
phone right and it's exactly how it

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,690
works with youth engine it lets figure

00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,660
you not so free on to speak with your

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,989
French number so you want to translate

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,780
automatically your sentences to the

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:24,580
appropriate language so write a demon

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:27,820
clients which subscribes to all such

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,520
events ask Google for the translations

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,800
and then push new it on to your friend

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,800
it's simple right

00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:44,490
users own you something is going to be

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:47,730
generic as I said so here you have the

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:53,700
behind of the site protocol for example

00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:57,720
of messages events which use of the sack

00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:02,040
that message that you even skype but

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:05,370
when using genes see the messages these

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:10,200
events they don't know what kind of

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:13,740
event it is it should eat just evens so

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:17,250
it's completely generic this you can

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,890
build your own protocol and it's the

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,470
true power of use engine because you can

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:26,460
will you know your own interactive

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:32,670
protocol this can lead to a huge

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:36,300
ecosystem you know how using gene works

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:39,840
a perv subcellular as I said and you

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,910
know what it's supposed to do but what

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,520
kind of thing you can do with it first

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,760
moment we have a demonstration available

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:52,170
on your site which is users and at work

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,540
and we show a very subset of what you

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:59,370
can do with it but actually we want

00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:02,460
developers to imagine imagine and find

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:06,600
their own usages r1 real-time

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,690
application and by the simplicity on the

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,220
generosity of you changing the

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:16,200
limitations are certainly on

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:20,010
imaginations I with some links to dig

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,260
further in the ecosystem your orchid is

00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,690
ungettable and we are a lot of

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:28,230
documentation to dig further in the

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:31,470
ecosystem of use engine using Jim is a

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:35,910
young project it is fun and it is free

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:39,960
free as in freedom and it has been read

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:45,620
for developers you so contributing are

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,620
very welcome thank you

00:06:49,590 --> 00:07:04,169
now I have Flint yota of time for

00:06:52,750 --> 00:07:11,680
questions is there any questions yes I

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:16,990
don't get it and the question is our the

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:20,110
persistence is done right and so we have

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:24,520
multiple backends but primarily as we

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:28,570
have an encore we use knizia and mogu

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:50,440
tebe of double bacon you can choose one

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:53,430
of them yes yes yes as we have

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,880
persistence we can have replay etc and

00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:00,490
we are which we really think we are

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:04,780
simpler than google wave because we are

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:07,419
not the federating aspect but which one

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,360
really to keep things simple on to start

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:14,349
really fast for example most of your

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,199
code is a JavaScript so you can starting

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,570
really fast with it because we're which

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,330
an ecosystem of widgets with which are

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,880
available on the demonstrations so you

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,699
can perch with it you can put your

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,650
widget on your site and it works because

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:31,650
you can talk directly to the server

00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,220
this

00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:03,870
and it's a good question because I don't

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:13,640
really know about this but we maybe we

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:13,640
can chat with it later because the call

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:21,150
dispatch is evil to the clients but on

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:24,810
the con side I don't know if you can see

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:27,690
if there is even that you are Avant

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:31,140
because this is a call with which manage

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:35,060
this so maybe it's more complications

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,060
that than that

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:47,139
okay no more questions going once going

00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:49,379
twice thank you very much for your

00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:49,379
