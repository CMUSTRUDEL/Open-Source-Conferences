hey good morning everybody my name is

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,850
Lori Tchaikovsky I'm going to be

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,960
speaking about is the UK government

00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:18,330
backing free software so historically in

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,450
the past no they've not while they have

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,880
said that they do have policies in place

00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:26,759
and to provide and back open source they

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:32,700
actually have never implemented it but

00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:34,470
this is going to change here we go so

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,660
for the previous 13 years you've had the

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,950
Labour government in power where they

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,290
want to proceed be perceived as

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,840
pro-business and pro-business meant that

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,400
they were bridge on Murdoch which are

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,570
usually large multinationals and like

00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,460
multinationals meant that they were a

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,470
vendor locked in and usually not very

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:58,470
fun in opened open source there were

00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,940
policies in place and what with that

00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,440
what that meant was there was not

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,769
actually anybody willing to actually

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,140
implement them at the low scale back

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,840
when they're at the low ends like the

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,750
civil servants whether a response for

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,840
buying the open for the products the

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,150
system integrators wrong majority not

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,260
very open source friendly and so that we

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,180
do actually have the open source

00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,150
policies in place but they haven't been

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,010
implemented and that was basically due

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,500
to prior the prior governments and what

00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,290
you hoped I actually does change so with

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,320
the new coalition in place and they have

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,970
been looking at open source alternatives

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,030
and this is at all levels including

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,040
senior level there is a senior minister

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,780
in place who deals with actually open

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
source and that their sole job and roll

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,560
it's a look at open source in government

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,880
where they've set of think tanks to

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,880
actually provide open source solutions

00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,350
Oh

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,189
so how has actually changed well the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,990
back she started to go commitment from

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,759
political level so the politicians in

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,680
power at the moment actually want to see

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,030
open source in play they're looking at

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,910
all their alternatives they don't want

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,170
to look at just the same ol ding-dong

00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,519
they want to actually change the rules

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,099
and how they're going to do but that is

00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:16,230
actually and talk to open source

00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,209
developers here in the UK they're going

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,760
to actually ask for help and they are

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:25,140
doing that present so what a change is

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,880
going to happen is that on the eleventh

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,110
of februari this year there's actually

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,390
events they're going to take place in

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,250
the UK to make this happen there's a

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,350
small to medium enterprise so much

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,130
taking place with francis maude at the

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:40,470
Treasury where members of open-source

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,599
agencies in the UK and people who are

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,910
very well respected in the UK are coming

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,500
taking part in those discussions and

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,880
hopefully they'll be able to persuade

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,780
the government that they actually should

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,030
be looking at open-source alternative

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,010
other than just the usual system

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,630
integrators so the art looking are

00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,030
changing again in February these just

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,850
been released is that the there is a so

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,060
much taking place in the 21st which is

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,950
basically going to have members of

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,840
open-source advocacy groups including my

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,940
company and other companies taking part

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,609
in the event and they will be talking

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,630
with procurement people and explaining

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:18,359
that they need to look at all their

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,829
alternatives and the areas they're going

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,970
to look at obviously is there they

00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:22,470
looking at strategist how they can

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,019
actually change things how they're going

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,819
to actually make a difference but it is

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,670
actually happening a place in the UK

00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,139
we're very fortunate already kind of

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,670
cancer going to take it on workshops

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:33,870
where they want to set up their entire

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,109
infrastructure using open source

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,609
technologies the Ministry of Defence has

00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:42,299
just taken on a workshop and is looking

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:44,549
at trying other solutions and the mess

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,139
for your for the weather they're also

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:47,579
looking at changing so there are a

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,290
change they are looking at alternatives

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,530
it is going to happen very very slowly

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,680
though

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,120
but I'm one of the leading councils in

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,190
the UK Bristol accounts which is one of

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,920
the largest ones there has just rolled

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,350
out and their entire infrastructure will

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,640
be using open source technologies that

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,790
it's one of the largest ones the UK to

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,260
roll this age which is pretty good to

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,390
see that it's finally happening it is

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,330
going to be slowly happening but at

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,750
least it is happening that's willya

00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,750
thank you

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,080
okay so the question was as individuals

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,509
how can we actually help this happen

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,620
well talking to your politicians talking

00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:44,060
to your local governments or if you have

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,250
any contacts with the small to medium

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,630
businesses talking to them and explain

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,520
that there are other alternatives other

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,900
solutions or if you know if consultants

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,600
that are in the areas then talking to

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:58,729
them as well right yeah gives me a focus

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,750
on the back office are you making no

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:05,460
goal headings on the dead stop fighting

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,570
focusing it an open source into the back

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,190
so the question sir is the main focus

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,710
again the back offers are the desktop

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,750
and it is both actually defining

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,420
yourself so bristol as an example it's

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,500
as I back end is also open source and it

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,050
will be slowly integrating into the

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,510
desktop so start back in and go to the

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,230
front end if we possible but start one

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,730
way and then we're glass if possible yes

00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,140
it is a massive challenge but I mean

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,060
it's like supposed to look and do I

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,830
don't see any reason why other councils

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,240
can't do it he finding some of these

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:46,240
functions is going to I think it's

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:47,650
Bailey yeah no you're right so I think

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,670
the case is i bristle is actually

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,530
pushing for they're actually having

00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,210
other events to push for and they are

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,980
the leading councils are doing this and

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,450
other councils are asking about it which

00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,430
is the reason why we've had a kind of

00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,080
workshop at least I'm not another

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,720
councils are looking for the exact same

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,120
kind of what can we do how can we do it

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,020
please set us down and tell us so there

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,360
is interest out there oh dear you just

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,900
read the outline what the pitch is there

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,180
goes what's the advantage

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,960
and who who is the person your targeted

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,960
Matthews

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,580
you

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,090
professor you finding it the best person

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,090
speak to

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,120
who's the best person to talk to and

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,730
well from well from what I know is I've

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,830
just writing my company and what we have

00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,300
done is targeted the actual procurement

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,610
people and talk to them and set them

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,390
down because sometimes the IT manager

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,800
didn't really know what other

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,960
alternatives of the were and if that was

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,180
the key blockade then you can't get in

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,650
and if they are aunty open source then

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,480
that means it's not going to get into

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,400
the company even if the people be above

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,750
him actually like open source so you

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,050
need to target the IT managers in

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,910
certain cases due to cultural change

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,250
them about start working for a bit of

00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,530
council and they're telling us that due

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,600
to the availability to enforce

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,340
encryption and things like

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,570
all those laptops we have two windows

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,350
we're not gonna be allowed to use this

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:16,130
now to combat that how do you combat

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:18,050
stupidity I'm not entirely too sure to

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,310
be honest I know that in the case of so

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,710
the next two summits that are going to

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,910
happen in the UK this month is when it's

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,250
going to come down from government level

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,570
telling this into civil servants we did

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,250
the people are gonna be responsible for

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,990
buying and promoting open source within

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,010
companies they have to actually look at

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,630
alternative so they can't just come up

00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,440
with excuses like that anymore they

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,280
actually have to sit up and pay

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,840
attention yeah you may want to look at

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,180
what the European Commission is doing

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,070
its been working a lot to give a

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,630
procurement guidelines for open source

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,250
we want to invite them in that summit

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,250
because they've been

00:07:49,280 --> 00:08:00,930
okay thank you homework hello entally

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:03,820
yes vacation before open source

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,850
government become a process

00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,850
I

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,870
questions about how our workshops

00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,180
actually work close the latter Andre and

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,100
they actually work with clients where

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,660
our company goes in and talks and sits

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,130
down with the counts and see what kind

00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,960
of requirements they actually want and

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,960
how best they can actually be matched

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:34,570
okay with regards to education our

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,520
company is actually helping organize the

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,649
senior leader conference on april fifth

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,839
in the UK we're hoping to educate the
