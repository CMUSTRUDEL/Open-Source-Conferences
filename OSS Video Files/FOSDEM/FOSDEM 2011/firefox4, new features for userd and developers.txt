so good afternoon I'm crystal Nieto

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,220
president and founder of a nonprofit

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:23,100
organization called Mozilla Europe you

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,070
may have heard about our main product

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,390
called Mozilla Firefox and i'm here with

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,630
a Antony Antony Enrico here on stage who

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,640
was a web developer and open source

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,520
contributor he has a history of

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,899
contributing to what's this name of this

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,239
browser again it's a fruit company I'll

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,940
remember anyway so he used to contribute

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,760
to Safari but he's seen the light and he

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:59,000
came in in contributing to Firefox now

00:00:50,760 --> 00:01:02,129
but I I like him anyway so apologies for

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,790
this this presentation which is quite a

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,680
mess I was told yesterday I think around

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,590
seven that there was a slot available

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,659
and it would be nice to have a firefox

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:19,500
presentation and so I had like literally

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,920
no slides nothing to show and I would

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:29,070
like to thank Anthony for joining me we

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:31,049
had room service lasagna in in my room

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,700
and so we created this this presentation

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,340
yesterday evening instead of going to

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:41,970
the beer event and so it's a kind of a

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:44,520
big sacrifice so I know what we did have

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,310
a bottle of wine anyway so no beer but

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,520
wine instead it's but it was not really

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,520
a party

00:01:51,170 --> 00:02:01,979
well I am I'm going to talk to you about

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:04,350
me mostly three things the one is the

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,220
cloud phenomenon and what's what's going

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:12,209
on how Firefox is changing in this

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,520
regard with Firefox 4 and we'll also

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,060
talk about the browser as a as a

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:25,050
platform and this will include

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:29,459
demonstrations by Antony I was actually

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:32,820
very pleasantly surprised this morning

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:35,760
by a eben mogollons talk who in this

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,760
room has attended eben mogollons talk

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,010
this morning raise your hand well not

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:49,050
enough people let me tell you well it's

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:52,950
better than nothing Emlyn who's a an

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:58,980
amazing guy actually had a very nice

00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:04,250
words for Firefox that was cool but also

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:08,790
mostly he had he had a discussion about

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:11,070
privacy and network centralization which

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,640
is very close to my heart and so it was

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:17,310
a pleasure that you hear a Ben discuss

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,650
these in my opinion very important

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:27,329
issues so whether we want or not the

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:31,280
cloud the cloud paradigm is is taking

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:36,840
over information technology everything

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:42,510
it's it's the big big trend this decade

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:45,739
of you know moving to the cloud and I

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,739
don't think we can stop it

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:55,110
but if we cannot stop it how can we make

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:58,830
sure that we as users as free software

00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:04,260
developers and citizens of the internet

00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:10,050
how can we ensure that we have maximum

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:12,990
control over what's going on so this is

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,260
this is one thing I want you to keep in

00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:20,390
mind during this this discussion today

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:23,550
is the cloud is happening but firefox is

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:26,960
the product that we Mozilla's own

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:30,020
organization are producing in order to

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,950
remain in control as much as possible

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:41,250
with our data and our future so while

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:45,150
the cloud is taking over IT the browser

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:48,450
needs to evolve like remember at the K

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:51,690
to go the browser basically was

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:55,860
something to display a web page a static

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:57,660
web page like a Wikipedia web page I'm

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,180
not dismissing Wikipedia in any way but

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,060
you know it's very static document that

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:07,820
evolves maybe a couple of times a day or

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,820
a month but it's a very static document

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:17,580
now we're talking about web applications

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:22,530
how many of you use a web mail raise

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:27,720
your hand all right so many of you know

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:29,760
what a web application is firsthand so a

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,680
web application is not a document

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,979
anymore I mean there is a lot of things

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,030
going on downloading new emails writing

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:43,500
composing emails and stuff like that the

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:47,640
page itself is evolving in real time the

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:51,150
browser has to evolve in this regard an

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:54,169
issue the browser had was it had limited

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,669
capabilities as a development platform I

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:58,710
mean it was meant to display webpage

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,050
static web pages now

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,060
now that we're moving to web apps how

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,010
does it work many things have to be

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,870
changed and this is what we're going to

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:13,920
see today privacy and centralization how

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:17,820
we cope with this and also as the world

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,090
is going mobile as many of us have now

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:27,270
things like self smart from cell phones

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:31,070
we carry around which in turn fuels the

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:34,230
interest for the cloud itself I mean I

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:39,270
don't want my data to be on my computer

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:42,300
or at home or on my cell phone basically

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:46,140
I want data to be in the cloud and I can

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:49,050
access it from any device i want this is

00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:52,800
what fuels the interest for cloud

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,840
computing so there is good too with that

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,870
with with cloud computing but this means

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:05,100
you can also need a mobile web browser

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:07,980
that you can trust so I'll start by

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,910
discussing Firefox for in terms of user

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:15,330
interface and user facing features what

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:18,000
we have what we have done with Firefox

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:23,550
for where things that are new one thing

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,220
that we have is a tab on top so the tabs

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:29,070
now are here these are a screenshot from

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:34,530
a Windows version I'll show you on Linux

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:37,680
what did that with how it shows with

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:41,160
generally a new a new theme new look and

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,450
feel the location bar which makes sense

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:49,260
is now closer to the content because

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:55,200
actually relates to the content you will

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:57,150
see in Windows and soon on Linux its

00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,420
debate disabled by default but we can

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:06,630
fix that you will see that there is no

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:12,000
more menu bar so overall the ID is to

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:14,730
limit the importance of

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,130
the chrome real estate on the screen

00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:20,010
chrome being not only a competing

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,540
browser but historically the chrome is

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,310
the name of the user interface of the

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:27,360
browser now it's confusing that they

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:31,050
took this as a product name but in in in

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,419
the browser vendor jargon this is what

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,300
you call the chrome and this too is that

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,320
the piece of the browser that you see

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:43,530
which is not the content so we wanted to

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,410
reduce this to the maximum so no menu

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,720
bar and you know shaving a pixel here

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:53,010
and there in order to have maximum space

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,310
on the screen for the content or the web

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:59,940
applications and tabs on top is a is one

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:03,300
way of achieving this another thing we

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:07,560
have is some is a feature called switch

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,630
to tab as you have more and more tabs

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,560
open because I don't know if you're like

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:16,190
me but basically the browser is is the

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,520
piece of software that I run like 24 7

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:27,380
it's it's where my life is and so I have

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:29,850
many many tabs open and when I want to

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,550
look for something what I want to access

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,070
some information because the location

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,500
bar in Firefox is smart this is what we

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,900
call the awesome bar you start you open

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:46,170
a new tab start typing what you're

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:48,180
looking for and the suggestions here if

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,480
you start typing wiki it suggests

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:57,120
wikipedia.com which is calm come on well

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,190
anyway or it could suggest in this case

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,490
which is new in Firefox for you already

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:07,140
have a Wikipedia tab open so it suggests

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:09,240
that you go to the existing tab which

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,750
has Wikipedia instead of opening yet

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,250
another Wikipedia tab so it prevents you

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,089
in the end when you start you know

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,640
cleaning up the mess in your tabs from

00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:22,050
closing like 20 wikipedia tabs that

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,990
we're open at the same time which

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,810
doesn't make sense so this is one nice

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,570
feature

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,670
so switch to tab we are suggesting to

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:37,000
move to the tab which is already open

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:39,370
instead of reopening a new tab and the

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,839
Firefox button you see there on the top

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:50,140
left corner is basically a menu well the

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:53,070
list of options if if you're not

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,180
displaying the menu then you have that

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,210
because we've been studying very

00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,779
thoroughly with our user experience

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:05,410
people what are the items that are

00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:07,839
actually used in the browser and we've

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:11,710
seen that many of them are not used and

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:15,370
so we decided to remove them and put

00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:17,500
them in in this Firefox button so they

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:24,430
they are not in the way and a safe space

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:27,910
for for the content app tabs is a pretty

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:32,760
neat and actually you know what I am I'm

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,760
going to demo it for you

00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:46,290
I don't know where I stand okay the

00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:49,449
looks like the network is pretty limited

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:54,339
anyway twitter is something I use pretty

00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:56,829
often so what I'm going to do is right

00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:03,369
click on it I sorry that's the French

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:05,889
version hmm fail and I can click there

00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:09,309
no that's okay well this is in English

00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:12,730
would read a pin a zap tab and look at

00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:18,149
my Twitter tab is going to switch to the

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:23,230
left there you go and now it's it's here

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:27,189
but it's a tiny it's a tiny icon doesn't

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:34,959
take a lot of space in a tab bar and if

00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:43,799
I open new tabs here you see that my

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:43,799
twitter is still here you know so it's a

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,360
it stays there so you can do that for

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:54,280
example this is this is my blog maybe

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,050
it's some Institute place or maybe it's

00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,240
I don't know it's gmail whatever you

00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,820
know your webmail you want to access it

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,450
very often and instead of having it lost

00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:09,250
in the sea of tabs you right click on it

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:11,530
and you say pin is apt tab and there it

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:16,560
goes it's here so it takes tiny space

00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:21,730
and it's very very efficient for when

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:26,320
you know to save a space for for their

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:34,470
web apps you use often as opposed to

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:34,470
random tabs what else did I want to show

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:51,850
yes another one is a panorama panorama

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,980
is a way to manage your tabs so if you

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,420
have and I wish I could show it to you

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,030
but because I don't have a good internet

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,340
connection it's not going to be a very

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,800
interesting but basically panorama is a

00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,550
button that you click on a top right

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:11,380
corner of user user interface and it

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:15,610
enables you to put together groups of

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:18,840
tabs so in this case that was I was

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:22,900
writing an article that Marshall McLuhan

00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:25,300
famous Canadian on on the communication

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:28,300
theory and so I've put all my tabs about

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,030
him together in a group and all my work

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,250
tabs on on on the left and I can switch

00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:38,680
from where I'm group to the other so it

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:41,140
makes organizing my tabs much easier and

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,380
also because it's visual and it's 2d I

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,540
can I have the notion of where I can

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:52,019
find easily my tabs instead of having

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:54,959
them listed on the on the tab bar

00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:57,959
so it's a pretty powerful and very

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:02,910
useful some something else we've been

00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:07,230
working on during the Firefox 4 cycle is

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:11,029
performance and performance believe it

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:15,899
or not is actually extremely complex as

00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:19,049
a topic including very a different topic

00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:23,759
sink like startup time we've made a lot

00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:25,860
of effort in streamlining the startup

00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:30,239
time reducing the startup time so that

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:34,170
the startup process is much faster it

00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:36,449
doesn't matter much to advanced users

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:40,379
because Firefox is always launched like

00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:42,540
24 7 for them but for a last advanced

00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:46,410
user that tend to watch one page and

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:49,829
then close the program and go back to

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,769
email and then we launching Firefox like

00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:56,339
an hour later or so this is important to

00:15:52,769 --> 00:16:01,049
them so we've been working on this

00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:04,980
startup time quite a bit the JavaScript

00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:06,540
engine we have a new generation of the

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,889
JavaScript engine which is called jager

00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:14,069
monkey I'll detail more about the

00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:16,529
performance we've been working on a very

00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:22,019
difficult topic which is called hardware

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:24,299
acceleration so I I mention here that

00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:28,730
your mileage may vary because hardware

00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:31,529
acceleration basically is using your GPU

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:35,639
basically your graphical processor on

00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:38,699
your graphics card leveraging it so that

00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:42,379
it helps the browser do you do complex

00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:47,360
computation about page layouts

00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:52,639
displaying text on the screen or 3d or

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:56,700
decoding videos and stuff I doubt it is

00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:00,180
that the GPU is an unused

00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,180
part of your computer that is extreme

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,750
extremely powerful on the other hand it

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:10,410
is very complex and between Firefox and

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:15,530
the GPU stands a very complex bit of

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:20,459
software which is the device driver so

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:25,260
well hardware acceleration works pretty

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:30,900
well in in Windows and more precisely in

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:34,500
recent version of Windows it's not easy

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:38,910
to make a work on a mac and it's even

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:42,770
harder on Linux because there is such

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:46,830
difference with before between certain

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:52,170
drivers and other drivers on linux

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:55,740
graphical drivers I won't get into the

00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:58,020
mass of the NVDA proprietary drivers

00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,800
versus open drivers and stuff I doubt

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:04,530
but physically we're dragged into this

00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,710
and it's a it's it's complicated so in

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:10,020
some cases if you're lucky enough if

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,510
your drivers are high quality then we

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:18,570
can leverage them and you will see a

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:21,180
boost in terms of performance but if we

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,760
are not sure that the drivers are bug

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,890
free enough then with the sable hardware

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,140
acceleration on linux and then you'll

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:33,240
see a good Firefox 4 but not blazingly

00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:35,760
fast on certain on the other pieces of

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,860
rendering that are impacted by hardware

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,950
acceleration so it's a it's a very

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:46,070
complicated topic just for the record

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:49,020
Microsoft is using hardware acceleration

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:53,600
we've been fighting on on who had the

00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:58,680
first product to do that I claim that

00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:03,330
Mozilla produced prototypes of Firefox

00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:06,300
build earlier than Microsoft we try to

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,950
do that on all platforms and Microsoft

00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,290
say yeah we can do that only on vista

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:14,720
and seven but XP is

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:17,670
battle actually we're if if I'm right

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,490
we're able to do a hardware acceleration

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:24,540
also on XP it's just they don't try hard

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:28,500
enough well of course there the bottom

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:32,010
line of that Microsoft is about selling

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:35,480
more version of vista and mostly seven

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:38,550
so so yeah they don't care much about XP

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,550
tons of optimizations have been going on

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:43,800
in terms of performance I won't get into

00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:47,940
details but we call them compartments

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:52,200
retain layers and many others basically

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,760
its aggressive caching and better better

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,540
management how they're called the code

00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,560
base and one final thing is trim lining

00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:03,510
the experience and this is kind of a

00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,240
tricky thing but i'll save it for for

00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:15,090
later let's let's start about the

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:18,060
javascript yoga monkey engine so these

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,920
are graphs these are benchmarks and this

00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:27,360
is the benchmark called a v8 bench

00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:31,020
produced by google so in red here this

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,280
is a safari so basically we take the

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:40,500
Safari JavaScript engine called nitro

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:43,050
and we run the test regularly we take

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,230
their nightly builds isolates they're

00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:49,940
there javascript engine and run tests we

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:55,760
weren't uh the benchmark it gives this

00:20:49,940 --> 00:21:01,560
this line we do the same with a google

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:06,610
v8 JavaScript engine which is getting a

00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:11,530
slightly better sometimes worse

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:15,520
and we do that with a Firefox jager

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:18,929
monkey strava script engine as we can

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,929
see we make a lot of progress

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:25,990
mid-september we went the smaller is

00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,780
better right lower is better so we've

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:34,660
been meeting regularly Safari since then

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:38,410
and we're approaching Google's engine on

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:43,210
Google's benchmark which we can assume

00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:44,919
their benchmark is favorable for their

00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:50,530
own engine you know that's how people

00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:54,010
build benchmark yes december january and

00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:58,929
it's better now okay so we were even

00:21:54,010 --> 00:22:02,919
better now this is this is yeager monkey

00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:06,730
or javascript engine now running on sun

00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:10,510
spider which is apple's benchmark and so

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:15,090
we're better than both Safari and chrome

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:18,100
in terms of JavaScript on Apple's

00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,110
benchmark and we also have an our own

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:26,740
benchmark we're beat everyone of course

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:28,990
visit our benchmark and we pretend and I

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,820
think we are right but yeah who knows

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:34,240
that our benchmarking is better than

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:39,220
their benchmark but right I won't get

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:45,220
into that so well just just to so

00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:48,429
JavaScript we're as you can see we've

00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:52,780
made huge progress in terms of

00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:54,580
JavaScript over time so we're highly

00:22:52,780 --> 00:23:01,200
competitive even better than others or

00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:05,020
very close so we've closed the gap with

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,740
regards to JavaScript execution it's a

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:10,540
JavaScript education execution is not

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:14,860
it's you know it's just part of the

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:17,919
performance issue but if you have very

00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,210
complex applications and makes the

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,940
difference

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:30,200
we've made already very significant

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:33,220
progress between Firefox 35 and 36 was

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:36,740
it you remember rick Anthony then with a

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,500
battery of JavaScript engine and it made

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:44,650
a big difference for users that were

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:49,010
running gmail like basically when you

00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:51,350
when you click on the link it changes

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,200
immediately as opposed to having to wait

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:56,150
like half a second and half a second for

00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,870
the human being you feel like you're

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:02,900
waiting but if it's like under a tenth

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:05,450
of a second for the software to react

00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,270
then you have the impression in instant

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:11,210
in years and so we we went under that

00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,429
tenth of a second threshold and it

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:21,200
really made a difference for using a

00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:23,780
gmail now in a very very different topic

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:28,280
I'm going to talk about performance but

00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:32,000
mostly the impression of performance

00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:36,470
because then you go back there when we

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,929
we go from here to there frankly users

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,210
don't see a difference we've been

00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:44,030
working really hard to go from here to

00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:48,620
there really hard and it's paying off

00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:51,860
but people they see nothing just it was

00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:56,150
fast before and it's even faster after

00:24:51,860 --> 00:25:01,210
but so little and it's was so fast

00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:06,400
before they they just cannot notice it

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:11,270
on the other hand in the user interface

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:14,900
there are things when you start making

00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:17,000
things differently people see a lot of

00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,220
change but actually product is not

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,480
faster but it gives the impression to be

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:26,540
faster I've listed a few a few example

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:30,710
let's start for the this last one you

00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:32,559
add a new add-on in Firefox and instead

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,749
of saying you have to

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,600
restart Firefox it says that's okay you

00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:39,700
can use the add on now so you've you've

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,279
saved time by not you know exiting

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,049
firefox and reentering firefox you can

00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:47,409
use it now so it means a lot of work

00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:49,929
behind the scenes but it's really

00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:54,600
changes the way you use firefox

00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:54,600
installing the install and add on

00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,249
reloading old tabs you have the choice

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,990
of reloading or not the old tabs and if

00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:05,799
you reload them your base we're

00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:08,950
basically loading a couple of them that

00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:10,509
are visible and all the others they are

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,789
ready but when you hit the tab button

00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:14,710
then they start with loading that means

00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:20,590
that when you restart Firefox for some

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:24,249
reason it restarts very very quickly and

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:30,009
also when you started that's number one

00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:32,559
item it is not saying okay hold on I got

00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:35,470
to make sure that you have the data set

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,149
ons for this version so you do not see a

00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:41,799
pop-up that say is hold on i'm going to

00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:43,779
check the add-ons what we've done is

00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:46,210
we've checked the add-ons in the

00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:48,669
background during your last session and

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:51,820
if new add-ons are ready and we install

00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:54,869
them then at startup which is a not

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,519
visible and then you go so it's it's

00:26:54,869 --> 00:27:01,029
changing the product so so that you

00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:04,720
don't have added boxes down of boxes and

00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:07,330
things that make you feel like it's

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,610
painful to use it or it's it's not

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,889
responding the way you want and it's

00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,539
giving you the impression that it's

00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:15,970
actually much faster it's actually

00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:21,850
really more pleasant to use then

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:26,169
actually faster on a very different

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:30,610
topic something we've done is raising

00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:33,850
the bar on privacy we're very happy at

00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:41,049
Mozilla to see that privacy is actually

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:42,980
becoming a topic of interest with the

00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:45,970
European Commission

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:50,330
with the government of the United States

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:52,669
and also browser vendor let's start to

00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:55,309
feel the heat because they are concern

00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:58,940
there will be regulation from

00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:03,980
authorities so this we've been fighting

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:06,770
for privacy for a while there there are

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,480
extensions such as a taco and better

00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:12,799
privacy that were that have been

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:21,110
available for a few years already that

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:24,290
basically say put cookies in Firefox and

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:28,610
these cookies that are set by

00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:31,669
advertising networks when when an

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:35,540
advertising network seized it cookie on

00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:39,980
your computer then they are not going to

00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:41,870
track you that's that promise whether

00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,490
people obey their promises is a

00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:46,549
different story and I won't get into

00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,590
that but because the advertising

00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:51,559
industry is concerned that will they

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:55,940
will get regulated they have put this

00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:57,440
mechanism into place and they offer you

00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:02,390
to put these cookies so you're not

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,120
tracked now these cookies can actually

00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:07,220
disappear or and so these extensions

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,320
make sure these cookies staying place so

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,970
even if they're removed their put back

00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,429
into place and these cookie says no I

00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,470
don't want to be trapped for each and

00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:17,450
every advertising network but I think

00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:20,690
there are like 74 of these advertising

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:23,210
networks and I have that other

00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:26,419
extensions such as adblock plus and no

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:29,570
scripts for the advanced users are also

00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:34,549
available for now seeing no advertising

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:38,990
no scripting personally I tend to also

00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:42,799
use a flash block that locks flash which

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,510
I highly recommend although we have to

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,260
recognize that these two plus flash

00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:53,020
block are really extensions that are for

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:55,580
the advanced user because well sometimes

00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,240
the website you're visiting doesn't work

00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,750
it

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,100
actually like like it should be because

00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:05,090
because you're basically you're you

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:07,730
remove stuff from it 36 these extensions

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:11,020
so unfortunately these I would not

00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:15,650
recommend them for ordinary users that

00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:17,690
don't feel like debugging websites that

00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,700
don't work well because of these

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:25,970
extensions although they are very very

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:30,110
efficient we're seeing companies such as

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:33,559
Google and Microsoft have recently

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:35,000
announced something similar to the

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:39,200
extensions that we have for several

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
years it's good in the case of Microsoft

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,590
they've built this into the product but

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,520
because their extension mechanism is

00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:52,670
very crappy but by default there is the

00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:56,960
there is a kind of a blacklist of ad

00:30:52,670 --> 00:31:00,559
networks and these black lists are empty

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,330
by default so yeah they have a Do Not

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:07,550
Track feature except that you may not

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:10,940
use it right google has announced their

00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:13,960
door doing something similar there

00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:20,170
within chrome but they're still at level

00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:26,360
number one what's new in firefox four is

00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:29,480
a very simple feature Cole the do not

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:32,740
track HTTP header see I think I'm going

00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,740
to show it to you

00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:42,120
I I it's not gonna work it's nothing

00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:45,480
b210 oh it's okay right so I'm not gonna

00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:48,809
show it to you cuz I what then we mean I

00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,660
need to run another version of Firefox

00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:55,559
which is a Nike bill but I have seen it

00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,390
on my other machine this is why i

00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:59,220
thought i would show it to you it is in

00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,049
fact in firefox though it's going to be

00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:11,160
in the next vita not in the one that was

00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:14,780
just released in one final thing we're

00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:19,110
doing on the on the privacy front is

00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:26,429
that is it's a service called firefox

00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:29,790
sync who has heard what firefox sync is

00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:33,540
raise your hand please alright i still

00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:36,059
have to explain it sorry for bothering

00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:40,710
me without 15 minutes left i need to

00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:44,010
hurry up because basically it's a

00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:48,450
service that backs up all your browser

00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:53,549
history on the server and your bookmarks

00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:58,919
and your password now these are highly

00:32:53,549 --> 00:33:02,160
sensitive informations so the way we do

00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:07,260
it at Mozilla is everything is encrypted

00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:10,950
by Firefox on the client side with a key

00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:13,770
that only you have and it's sent on on

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:19,679
the Mozilla server means that Mozilla

00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:22,440
cannot decrypt it and read it I

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,990
understand what is your history and what

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,929
are your passwords other browser vendors

00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:30,540
offer similar services although they do

00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:32,910
not offer encryption because for them

00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:36,900
tracking where you've been is highly

00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:40,080
valuable data mining like eben Mogollon

00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,640
explain this morning is highly valuable

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,710
for the bottom line of these

00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,080
organizations but for us being a

00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:48,570
nonprofit organization caring about you

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,640
we do encryption on the client side and

00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:54,450
what we see in our servers is only

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,059
encrypted unusual unusual data that we

00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:00,690
cannot date to mine that's one thing and

00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:03,090
the second thing is that our server is

00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,669
open source it's free software you can

00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,919
download the source code for it and run

00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:10,350
it on your own server so we're also

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,270
addressing the issue of centralization

00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:19,500
of this you can run your own server off

00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:21,780
sync and so even even if you know it's

00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,060
encrypted even if you we're good people

00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,950
you may not trust us and you may want to

00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,690
run this on your own server and that

00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:30,000
will be fine and we're totally okay with

00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,889
that we'll still need to run a

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,379
centralized service because it's more

00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:40,830
simple for users and finally Firefox 4

00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:43,440
for mobile Firefox Sync is very useful

00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:46,080
in order to synchronize your history so

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,260
you can we use it on your smartphone

00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,899
like just typing a few letters on this

00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,500
because the keyboard is crappy you will

00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:58,770
be able to revisit tabs that are open

00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:00,630
somewhere on your other computer firefox

00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:03,390
for mobile is going to be really soon it

00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:07,730
will be running on maemo me go and

00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,730
android i'm running android yes

00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:16,520
uh how much RAM is required i don't have

00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:19,940
the specs in on top of my head but I run

00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:24,890
in on a on a pretty good android to dot

00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:35,900
to phone it works well so but I this is

00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:38,210
a good machine so 760 yeah may yes and

00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,910
what's important it's the same engine as

00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:44,120
Firefox 4 so if you can run it on

00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:46,550
Firefox for desktop you can run your

00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:53,500
application on on these on these things

00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:53,500
I'm switching over

00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:07,770
he wants to microphone what else

00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:31,049
hey is it okay yeah I have to say about

00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:35,249
firefox sync when i joined mozilla was

00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:37,439
still running Safari yeah I did it for

00:36:35,249 --> 00:36:42,109
three weeks because i had a have an

00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:46,049
iphone and and i switched when i

00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:49,649
discovered firefox ohm which is the just

00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:52,409
a sync client for the iphone and when

00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:55,199
i'm in the subway or in the car I can

00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:57,359
check my bookmarks I can check old pages

00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:09,599
and that's when i switch back to firefox

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:14,009
so really cool okay okay so i'm going to

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:17,009
talk about web web features in available

00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:21,149
in firefox for but most importantly in

00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:25,739
other browsers and em in their latest

00:37:21,149 --> 00:37:31,819
versions so I guess you've seen the

00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:36,679
html5 logo that the WTC is promoting so

00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:41,969
html5 does it's a number i were to put

00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:43,409
everything that's web inside it and so

00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:45,749
i'm not going to go into all the details

00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:52,589
because i don't have the time thank you

00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:55,499
Tristan but it's about new web features

00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:58,829
and and and new design features and you

00:37:55,499 --> 00:38:07,069
and having powerful JavaScript engines

00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:12,299
in the browser having a SVG as a first

00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:16,259
first class technology so SVG is about

00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:22,039
scalable graphics so highly important on

00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:25,679
mobile it's about having access to the

00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:28,019
to the decks desktop having access to a

00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:32,069
web page when it's offline and so that's

00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:34,450
really a lot of technology in there so

00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:36,849
this little demo

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:40,839
I'm not sure you can see exactly but

00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:44,290
there's a gradient radial gradient like

00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:48,280
it's light orange in the center and it's

00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:54,099
going red over there so that's done with

00:38:48,280 --> 00:39:00,000
css3 there's no image used on the bottom

00:38:54,099 --> 00:39:03,670
all the images are in fact videos so i

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,579
don't know if i do that if you can hear

00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:10,930
the sound but so it's playing and when i

00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:13,690
click that it's opening with a

00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:17,920
transition a rotation it's scaling up

00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:20,220
and so that's really not i'm not going

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,950
to say easy to do but that something was

00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:26,070
that that's really easier than before to

00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,070
do

00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:42,590
oh and by the way okay I don't know if

00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,350
you've noticed but I'm running it

00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:51,680
firefox full screen so on the markets

00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:53,360
really new and that's cool just twisting

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,760
was talking about panorama that's the

00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:59,420
way you use it I have all my demos here

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,670
and okay thanks all my demos on the on

00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,460
the right and have some links on the

00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:06,230
left full force diamond and and I can

00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:11,320
access as you can still access the app

00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:18,980
tab on Twitter Oh gmail or whatever

00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:26,240
again next one so let me refresh this

00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:31,640
okay so this one is to showcase how we

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:34,100
can access we can store data in the

00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,920
browser and we can stall code in the

00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:40,400
browser so if you're on a mobile you

00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,610
want to run an application if its native

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:47,060
or web you want access to it if you have

00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:48,980
access to the network or not so there's

00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,520
a there's a feature in html5 where you

00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:54,410
can store the code inside the inside the

00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,010
browser so next time you launched it it

00:40:54,410 --> 00:41:01,760
it's not going to go on the network and

00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:05,090
so you get a to-do you can do a to do to

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,420
do application really quickly and and an

00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:11,900
access it everywhere and you can also

00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:15,140
store data like so this demo is throwing

00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:19,190
a list of all the cities in the US and

00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:21,980
the zip code associated to that and so

00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:26,180
even if I ever I don't have a good Wi-Fi

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:32,560
here when I'm going to search for this

00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:32,560
one it should work and it's not oh yeah

00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:41,839
now I've been in i've been i've been in

00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:48,140
holidays there and it's in florida okay

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:51,010
let me try another one yeah and so as

00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:59,329
you as you can see it listed everything

00:41:51,010 --> 00:42:01,970
you see Florida FM so you can store it

00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:05,420
there's two kinds of storage a really

00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:08,390
quick one and simple one with a key and

00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:10,819
values and you get also in this demo

00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:13,670
it's using index DB and more complex

00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:17,630
database system where you can do queries

00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:20,829
and and really really cool on mobile

00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:23,809
devices but and if you want to do a

00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:27,109
webmail I know gmail is already using

00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:29,839
some of this stuff to install the gmails

00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:38,119
so that you get at least when you launch

00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:41,150
it real fast and okay this one yeah it's

00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:44,420
also important to move the browser out

00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:48,529
of the web and access the desktop and

00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:51,589
and some stuff like that so if i take

00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:54,799
this picture over here you see I can

00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:59,539
drop it like I don't need to go into a

00:42:54,799 --> 00:43:04,579
file picker and search for my phone and

00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:09,289
then when I'm going to drop it with a

00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:13,700
powerful JavaScript engine I can go into

00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:16,609
this image take the data in it extract

00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,380
the exif data because there's that

00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:23,059
that's what you get in anything two

00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:25,640
images and with that I can see where the

00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:30,559
picture has been taken what is the

00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:34,400
camera what else the diet endtime stuff

00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:38,240
like that and so when you're on the web

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:43,000
you can match this with a service called

00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,760
google maps and I just dropped it I

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,500
never eat enter or I never

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,200
to a server I'm just doing this on my

00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,270
machine computing the data into the

00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:59,460
image and you can see all the eggs if

00:43:52,270 --> 00:44:03,100
data in there and and especially the GPS

00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:07,810
latitude and then i'm using it to insert

00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:11,290
a google map on the place where the

00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:13,060
photo was taken and i don't have a I

00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:19,240
don't have a server I just have a Wi-Fi

00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:21,970
connection so that's really cool okay

00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:29,950
this one is really cool also the story

00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:35,710
behind it is very cool okay should have

00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:40,630
configured the screen before anyway so

00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:44,580
there's an audio tag into into a html5

00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:47,500
you just put the file in in the markup

00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:50,580
you can play it you get the user

00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:53,770
interface that you're seeing over there

00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:57,970
then it's really easy to insert audio

00:44:53,770 --> 00:45:00,580
files now but some people said it's not

00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:03,300
enough we want access to the sound that

00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:08,590
is playing and we want to play with that

00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:12,040
so going to run it and you don't need to

00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:17,050
eat the music that's not the point what

00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:20,010
you can see here is the data from the

00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:22,920
Sun that is playing in the background so

00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:27,730
that's something we couldn't do before

00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:32,680
it's not really useful so this way makes

00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:34,990
more sense and you can do a lot of

00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:38,250
validations but you cannot also modify

00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:38,250
the sound if I

00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:46,329
don't know if she's ever did but anyway

00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:50,380
so you can modify the sound on real time

00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:58,750
you can compute Fourier transformation

00:45:50,380 --> 00:46:05,890
on top of it anything and you can even

00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:07,569
do 3d that goes with the sound so the

00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,760
cool thing about that and I'm going to

00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:12,190
switch to another one because otherwise

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,240
you're not going to listen to me the

00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:23,859
cool story about that is that the guys

00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:26,710
whoops okay the guys who did that so

00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:31,299
there are the names are on top of it

00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:33,160
they said we want this the w3c was not

00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:36,279
going to spec it put it into a

00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:39,609
specification and so they decided to

00:46:36,279 --> 00:46:41,920
come to Mozilla and said okay we have an

00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:44,470
ID we want to access the sound and we're

00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:48,099
going to produce the patch and and and

00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:51,940
put that into Firefox and so they did

00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:53,980
the code to make it available they did

00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:57,430
the specification that now is going to

00:46:53,980 --> 00:47:00,670
be a standard of course there's

00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:04,539
discussion with other groups etc they

00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:06,130
did the demo I just showed you and they

00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:09,789
also did another one that i'm going to

00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:13,180
show you in a minute and and the really

00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:16,329
cool stuff is that except for making

00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:19,000
sure the code is secure and and not an

00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:20,859
performin enough there was no modular

00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,099
employee involved in the creation of

00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:25,569
this stuff so that's something you're

00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:29,619
not going to find in other open source

00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:31,869
projects like the one in the other one

00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:36,789
in mountain view

00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:43,960
and so this one oh you're not going to

00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:49,539
see anything yeah that's bad do you have

00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:57,190
control over the no okay the Sun yeah

00:47:49,539 --> 00:48:06,299
I'm Belgium ok anyway I'm going to run

00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:11,470
it oh yeah no but it's not enough

00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:16,380
anyway so this is using WebGL so WebGL

00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:21,059
is like OpenGL accessed on the web and

00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:25,269
so there's an audio file that's running

00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:27,759
the old animation you're seeing it's not

00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:33,329
a video it's an animation it's 3d

00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:36,549
computed on my laptop in real time so

00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:42,359
the way to prove that to you if the

00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:42,359
network wants to play with us ok

00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:49,160
okay so it's going to go into a CD and

00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:53,470
you'll see in real time some flickr

00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,470
photos with the first damn tag in it

00:48:53,859 --> 00:49:01,460
they should appear right now yeah in the

00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:07,010
background the Wi-Fi is not good enough

00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:09,339
to download the images on sorry but

00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:14,510
trust me it's really computing on the

00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:23,510
getting the flickr photos and another

00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:27,079
thing about four minutes thirty now that

00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:31,339
ha you can't see it the buildings over

00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:36,829
there they are playing at the same at

00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:43,910
the same with the music I don't know if

00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:47,960
you it's really good on my screen audio

00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:50,750
audio api for visualization of the the

00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:54,680
sound yeah so it's the building some

00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:58,010
light lights are moving at the same pace

00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:03,170
than the music and you can also insert

00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:07,630
videos inside this 3d animation so this

00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:07,630
is a big buck bunny i think

00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:20,230
and so again this was done by people who

00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:23,260
like music and wanted better audio

00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:27,900
access and all this computed with a

00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:34,390
really cool javascript engine tweedy

00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:42,960
with a WebGL and and all that stuff is

00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:42,960
it okay on time yes

00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:50,690
change sorry account I would like to

00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:58,940
have to end about the change regionality

00:50:50,690 --> 00:51:01,340
named create our first Mincher in an

00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:04,960
html5 specification that you can

00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:08,810
fracture they need introduced the right

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,270
what devices oh no that's not a crisis

00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:20,720
but also how do i know that i'm not sure

00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:23,720
i should also mention switches html5 so

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,590
um I'm not sure what what you are asking

00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:32,600
exactly but html5 is is at the same time

00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:41,620
as specification and a bunch of other

00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:44,620
stuff that yeah yes that's what this was

00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,620
yeah

00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:59,599
co mccomas as an audio api to build

00:51:55,430 --> 00:52:06,099
change originality into the html5 all

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:14,060
right I want to refresh different yeah

00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:17,720
that does a device API there's a lot of

00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:20,900
work in the w 33 and other other

00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:24,740
standards body to get access to audio

00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:27,500
like a just shown to get access to the

00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:32,000
webcam to get access to the microphone

00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:34,369
because that's part of this so

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,660
microphone and webcam this this is part

00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:40,730
of the device API that's worked in the

00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:44,390
work group or something like that which

00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:46,430
we should probably answer fly we don't

00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:49,369
have time for many questions any other

00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:53,080
questions I promise you can grab Anthony

00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:53,080
on TV yes

00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:14,920
the question is can we sync with firefox

00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:16,390
sync can we sync add-ons from 11 version

00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,880
of Firefox to the other the answer is

00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:21,119
not yet right now although we're we're

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,920
considering we're working on it now

00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,740
what's keeping us busy is is shipping

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:30,010
Firefox 4 so all the energy right now is

00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:32,590
is on Firefox 4 and i will see we'll see

00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:37,020
once it's shipped we'll see what we can

00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:40,270
do with the about extensions and the

00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:43,900
extensions i think and already seeing

00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:46,420
their preferences using sink if they if

00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:48,580
they choose to do it so you still have

00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:51,430
to install the add-on on your new

00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:54,700
computer but it will get the it will get

00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:59,050
the Preferences of this extension if if

00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:01,869
the extension is compatible with it if

00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:04,450
you have to convince somebody who had 11

00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:06,849
firefox to use chroma chromium to come

00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:09,550
back to firefox what would be your kind

00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:11,859
of short killer argument if you happen

00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:12,890
beyond the beyond the urban modeling its

00:54:11,859 --> 00:54:20,690
freedom and your

00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:22,790
even well so if I had to IIIi think both

00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:26,420
firefox and chrome are very good

00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:30,440
browsers written I should repeat the

00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:33,530
question so yes why should i use firefox

00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,930
instead of chrome there that's the

00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:38,450
question and the answer is well you

00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:40,550
should use firefox because it's made by

00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:44,180
us we're a nonprofit organization and

00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:47,000
our business is not coming from data

00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,650
mining user data but what if you were

00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,360
selfish person you and we're stupid

00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:53,360
person you don't care about oh well you

00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:56,240
know I don't know it's it's it's nicer

00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,350
the logo is nicer yeah okay if you're if

00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:02,630
you're an that's all the answer

00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:07,850
I give you know I'm not technical but I

00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:09,590
mean she's alone thanks Fang wrong um I

00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:13,100
work at Mozilla but I'm non-technical

00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:17,180
and and the thing that I like is the lot

00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:19,370
of work that they've done into the UI so

00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,470
the the features that were show like

00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:23,240
panorama I actually can visualize my

00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,860
tabs i have many windows mini tabs open

00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,990
hello it's clear i have a clear

00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:30,320
visualization i also have an iphone i

00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:31,820
got firefox home on it I got to play

00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,130
with an Android and when I go back to

00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:37,450
the US next week i'm switching tonight

00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:40,010
with android phone because i was able to

00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:41,930
you know play with sink and really get

00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:44,930
that same experience no matter what type

00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:47,420
of device i used so there is a lot of

00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:50,780
like different features it's faster it's

00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:52,700
cleaner and also you can bring it with

00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,860
you no matter what what you use and it's

00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:58,340
just being able to have you firefox on

00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,960
the go it's so important like I when I

00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:02,690
use another computer and it's not my

00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,940
firefox I'm pretty lost I'm used to

00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:06,590
organize my tabs everything the way I

00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:10,000
like it and you can do it now with

00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:10,000
Firefox 4 and the other options

00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:39,040
so is there an imitation about our dwell

00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:42,650
acceleration about the the brand of the

00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:55,339
GPU you're using so if someone wants to

00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:56,750
answer that from lagina yeah we're kind

00:56:55,339 --> 00:56:58,880
of working on this break right now

00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:02,150
you're asking about linux write the

00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,250
questions exclusively about clinics all

00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:06,260
right so then we are right now I think

00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:08,240
we only enabled an nvidia preparator

00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:12,770
driver because this is the only one that

00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:14,150
doesn't crash but we are so this is the

00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:15,980
sad note right like that's that's not

00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:18,230
the story would like to hear but the

00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:22,660
positive story is that when we when we

00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:25,130
started sending the dumps of the crashes

00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:29,390
we started getting responses from the

00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:33,770
acts or community much faster than from

00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:37,190
the from the vendors so basically a TI

00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:39,830
did not respond at all while the

00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:43,730
open-source ati driver started sending

00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:45,770
patches like two days later so even if

00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:48,380
we're starting from like a really bad

00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:51,760
position we believe that pretty soon

00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:56,540
we'll be able to enable eight at least

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,920
Adam radeon driver probably not sure

00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:00,430
about not an

00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,140
nauvoo what's done it full name nauvoo

00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:05,569
they are also working on this but they

00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:07,160
have kind of a complex issue that

00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:09,559
they're trying to resolve I think we

00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,109
like the work is progressing and will be

00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:14,359
enabling things as we as we go once we

00:58:12,109 --> 00:58:16,220
see their drivers working but it'll take

00:58:14,359 --> 00:58:18,440
some time to upstream to distributions

00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:20,720
as well right so it's not not going to

00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:24,049
happen tomorrow so that's that's the

00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:27,170
status and there's a full test shoot

00:58:24,049 --> 00:58:28,640
sweet coming with a WebGL so that makes

00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:33,160
that's going to improve the whole

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:36,559
situation on Linux not only for Firefox

00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:40,119
all right time is up sorry we can take

00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,119
