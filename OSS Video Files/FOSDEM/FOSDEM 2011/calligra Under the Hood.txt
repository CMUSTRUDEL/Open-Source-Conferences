The Calligra Suite (formely known as KOffice) is modern application suite comprising productivity and creativity applications. The productivity applications natively support the OpenDocument standard. Through a plugin system, conversion from most Microsoft Office file formats is supported. Because of a clear separation between engine and user interface, it is easy to create new user interfaces on top of the existing engine. Calligra provides support both for QWidget-based applications as for QGraphicsView and Qt Quick based applications. During this presentation, you will learn how to show an OpenDocument document using a Calligra canvas in a host application -- both QWidget-based and Qt Quick based. We will also discuss remaining issues in the Calligra architecture and the way forward to resolve those.
