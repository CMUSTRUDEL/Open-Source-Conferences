I

00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,880
you

00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:14,100
let me start off by saying welcome

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,100
welcome to Folsom 2011

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,000
so I hope you know why you're here and

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,710
what this conference is about so this is

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,849
folsom the free and open source

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:30,710
developers here be meeting this year we

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:35,460
have more than 300 talks I counted yes I

00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:39,120
326 to be precise that's a lot with more

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:43,500
than 300 speakers 304 I think so that's

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,870
exciting for them itself is organized

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,600
entirely by volunteers which makes it

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:55,200
quite unique it's also free of course

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:58,800
and well it started out on februari 2001

00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:03,239
and this is a 11th edition was here we

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,739
celebrated our 10 years now what what

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,909
does our schedule look like well we have

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,280
three keynotes namely even Moblin chris

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,799
lattner and jonathan carpet johnson

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,770
we'll talk tomorrow and even and Chris

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,289
are after this welcome talk and we have

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,780
six main tracks they will also happen

00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:24,119
here and in the other room about system

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,270
and browsing and these are all invited

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,789
talks but it's not all we also have 25

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,840
developer rooms spread over the two days

00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:36,139
so lots of projects and talks and 32

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,409
lightning talks now if we sum this up

00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:43,799
then then this amounts to 201 hours and

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,859
10 minutes of talks that's totally

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:51,139
amazing but luckily it's spread over two

00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,139
days so it's only 100 hours today

00:01:51,429 --> 00:02:00,140
no actually I would especially like to

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,929
thank the speakers and Mark told me that

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,569
I couldn't fit all of the 204 speakers

00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:10,190
on the slide so I decided to prove him

00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:16,549
wrong and if you want you can even

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:18,980
verified so ok now the booklet this is

00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:21,620
the booklet you can get it at the info

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,920
desk it contains lots of practical

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,680
information about this conference so the

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,780
first thing is of course general

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,680
information the Nashes the necessary

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:36,739
things of life network and food and also

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,010
some other things the second thing is

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:42,560
maps so if you get lost well then it's

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,989
too late but before you get lost get a

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,690
booklet their maps on it and it also

00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:51,640
indicates the important things like food

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:54,709
and the bar and fubar and all that stuff

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,280
ok the schedule of course is also in it

00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:01,760
that's actually most of it and and

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,130
there's more now for those that already

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,480
who already has a booklet can you raise

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:10,579
your hand it's ok nice well I do I have

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,940
some bad news it's it's kind of static

00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:16,819
which means that some some part of the

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,190
skeller already changed as you can see

00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:24,889
there most notably there's a rep

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:26,510
bruising track talk edit now what I'd

00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:28,370
like to ask especially who has got one

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,810
of those smartphones can you raise your

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:36,200
hand if you have a smartphone all right

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:38,900
you because we of course the schedule is

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,910
also online maybe even more practical

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,739
forms more elaborate forums it contains

00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,380
the descriptions and everything and are

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,720
plenty of ways to go to to get the

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,239
schedule namely just go to the website

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,739
with any device we also have a mobile

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:58,419
version MDOT folsom org and then plenty

00:03:54,739 --> 00:04:00,709
of applications for all sorts of of

00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,630
smartphones so if you just got on the

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,150
website you should be

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:09,790
and have the very latest schedule all

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:11,750
the time with you okay now some

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,840
localization perhaps well that's a

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:20,390
localization anyway you're here this is

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:22,790
the Jonas own building mark and the main

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,880
tracks will be happening here but also

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,340
in a chiffon which is where the other

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,640
arrow points to it's a conveniently

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:37,430
located far away from here so that you

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:39,500
do some exercise now the dev rooms and

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:44,120
the stands they will they are in the in

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,370
the h building and the aw building the W

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,580
building again a short walk but that's a

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,920
to keep you fresh now the difference

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,530
there's something I need to tell you

00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:59,390
about the Deaf rooms the dev rooms will

00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:03,550
be full it's so I guarantee to you they

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:05,840
will be full so if there's this

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,640
fantastic dog that you're in and you say

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,400
like I still have two minutes to go to

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,550
this order talk inside the room and you

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:17,090
hey you know you run or then you'll

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,600
probably encounter this sign every every

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,820
room has one and if this sign is shown

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,730
then please do not enter the room so

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,790
every room has a certain capacity if we

00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,890
if we go over it by too far then the

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,710
security gets angry at us and they kick

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,360
us out of not only that room but this

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,870
entire facility and forth and will be

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,140
over so we don't take this lightly and

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,750
if if you would see somebody that is so

00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:48,800
rude as to ignore this sign then don't

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:52,490
hesitate to be rude back to him right on

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,070
the other hand if you plan your schedule

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,310
in whatever way ahead of time and you

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,620
arrive when it's still when it's not

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:05,030
full yet then of course you're free to

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:09,980
enter okay now on to something lighter

00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:12,470
or well perhaps have your food Belgian

00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,900
fries the second best reason to come to

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,169
folsom and bells

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:20,020
in general the first best reason we will

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:22,570
see later but so there of course will be

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,449
plenty of Belgian fries and also

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,930
sandwiches hamburgers Pizza & Pasta the

00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:32,229
lost to our new additions this year

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:34,690
where can you find them here bear in the

00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:38,289
back of this building there's you can

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,900
get sandwiches there and then where the

00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:43,990
other arrow points to there will be the

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:47,110
fries and the pizza fans now as you can

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:51,970
see they haven't arrived yet but by

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:53,889
lunchtime they will can you go back of

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,630
course there are also local shops around

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,820
so if you if you follow the arrow

00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:01,360
upwards there's also a map in the

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:06,160
booklet then you will find restaurants

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,190
and shops and all that you want yes the

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:15,090
very best reason to come to folsom and

00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:19,300
Belgian the beer of course and beer and

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:22,900
beer and beer and you might have been at

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:28,000
the beer event yesterday so there's more

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:30,130
here there's a you can get it again very

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,530
close to the to where you are right now

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,770
close to the source and the other

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,599
location is a bit further away but it's

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,330
worth to go there because it's looked

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,690
larger there it's more quiet it's warm

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,729
its cozy so if you need a break if it

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:52,470
too many people then you can go to the

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:55,510
other bar and hang around there okay so

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:58,840
of course the conference is more than

00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,849
just beer fries and talk but you also

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,889
have is a cloakroom so if you have a big

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,530
luggage and coats and everything then

00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,449
you can store them safely away it's also

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,720
indicated in the booklet and indicated

00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:12,849
with arrows we have hacker rooms you can

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,699
check your email there there's also a

00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:17,620
wired internet so for those that still

00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,830
don't have a decent driver for their

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,700
wireless card you can

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,520
should be should be very few though the

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,460
key signing party that's on Sunday and

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,340
then on Sunday we also have a buff room

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:35,700
that's a room in which you yourself can

00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:38,370
can schedule a part of it and the way to

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,710
do this is that in the aw building on

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,510
one of the walls on the Left there's the

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,060
schedule and you can just write down

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,910
your name and so you can reserve 15 or

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,400
30 or 45 minutes of that room for your

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,820
project you can have a sit together and

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,650
do some brainstorming or hacking and a

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,680
lot see there are also certification

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:03,230
exams now again see the website or the

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,230
booklet for more information now

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,850
networking I don't think anybody

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,640
disagrees that networking is an

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,520
essential part of any conference so

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,970
let's go in to do some more detail about

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:23,550
it right now what's special about our

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:26,060
network what is that the we have a 1

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:30,780
gigabit uplink and is provided for free

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:33,900
by ballots to us that's incredibly

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,670
awesome and fast what's also incredibly

00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,800
nice is that the backbone is actually

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,480
from the UL be so there's a université

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,670
libre double sell the guys owning

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,560
everything of this and they they allow

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:47,280
us to use their fibers and to user

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,080
access points and and the last part is

00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,020
that there are some guys from cisco who

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,360
are extremely helpful and they also for

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,540
free they decided to come here and set

00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,850
up the wireless network entirely for us

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:04,380
we're incredibly lucky to have them and

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:07,200
if we go along in this direction to our

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:10,380
official sponsors o'reilly is our

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,270
cornerstone sponsor and the ulb again

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,960
they provide us these facilities for

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,760
free and without that I mean for them

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,850
wouldn't be for free and this wouldn't

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,230
be possible and well the atmosphere and

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,570
everything would just be totally

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:28,850
different so a big thanks to them and

00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,850
also to our elder all our other sponsors

00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:35,230
now you can also sponsor us because

00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:39,279
sponsors is only one part I think about

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:41,949
half of what what we use to run Folsom

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,050
and the other part are the donations all

00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:46,569
right so in the info desk at in the h

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,209
building you can donate and if you

00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:51,550
donate some money then you get stuff and

00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:54,850
you can win stuff the first three things

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:57,220
is what you get depending on how much

00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,249
you donate and the last three things are

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,679
what you can win if you donate and so

00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:05,110
the the draw for the donations rag will

00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:11,050
be in Sunday just before the closing

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:13,720
talk well yeah then of course there's

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:18,059
one last thing especially if you've been

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:23,170
to fuss them before work can you so

00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:26,319
there's this thing called the mythical

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:30,189
foes dumb dance it started out in 2006

00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:33,699
as a story between the the two guys that

00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:36,399
started for them and then every year

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:39,220
more and more people joined in to do the

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,040
Folsom dance and last year we celebrated

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:46,240
our 10th anniversary with everybody

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:49,149
doing the Folsom dance together so yeah

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:54,160
it's a fun that how how do we improve

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:57,189
that how can we do even better that's so

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,499
one of the remarks that we got is that

00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:03,699
you know it's called the Folsom dance

00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:06,309
but it's not really a dance and they

00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:08,439
kind of have a point there so we're

00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:10,540
going to do something about it of course

00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:13,480
you cannot dance without music and

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:17,980
that's where you guys are going to come

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,540

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,070
different make sure that there's some

00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:58,580
space in front of you because there

00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:01,580
there's this fantastic wooden sound

00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,860
bored sitting in front of you right so

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:07,370
if i do this then I'm going to ask you

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:12,740
to just slam the soundboard as hard as

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:19,310
you can alright so let's I'll do it

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:21,620
store right yeah ok now we're going to

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,260
have very little bit more so when I do

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,480
when I do this I want both sides to clap

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,270
and when I do this I want the middle

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:36,790
side too well oh my god alright are you

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:36,790

00:13:38,520 --> 00:14:03,709
okay slight variation a light club yes

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:07,490
perfect perfect oh well not perfect but

00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:10,160
really good okay I think that we have

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,769
the base set now so the music is there I

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,350
guess that leaves the Folsom dam itself

00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:19,370
so can I ask the stuff that's here to

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:23,060
join us so you will be providing music

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:27,259
and we will be doing a real faucet lens

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,920
now they don't know what to do so I'll

00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,920
shortly explain

00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:36,540
