the Magellan project

00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:20,210
it's basically a government-funded

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,180
projects we aim to improve children's

Microsoft Windows and Linux cash america

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,710
it is an Intel classmate pc based this

00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:36,170
one it had the first deployment of

00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,570
300,000 computers based on an older art

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,300
where the one that he sees Magellan mg1

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,300

and email support for the page version

00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,189
which is basically the difference for

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,780
the free version we have USB versions

00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,610
with reason right support referee user

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:13,030
forums we have shared ways with mandriva

though we are changing it to ubuntu so

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:19,369
what is how do you make project as big

00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:22,459
as this one how do we make it work we

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:24,380
ask help for right people first design

00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,909
and development we had the help of new

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,270
new period which is the KD oxygen

00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:31,219

cutie kitty developer which help has

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,789
made something needed to fight in the

00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:39,679
interface i'm going to show you later

00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:41,659
god help from a language institute to

00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:43,490
portuguese languages in church since it

00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:47,499
is for kids it's for schools we had to

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:51,259
make sure everything was correctly spell

00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:53,779
everything was okay since otherwise the

00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,939
Ministry of Education with this not be

00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:58,429
very pleased we had AdWords support by

realtek and Intel special realtek help

00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:02,959
us with the ocap support for these

00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:06,829
wireless driver which they didn't have

00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,420
and it's not working very well in

00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:11,569
general but it's working okay for this

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,610
project so these computer SOC p support

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,310
the teacher and I will talk about it

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,280
later that I can make these na sleepy

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,860
and every children in all classrooms can

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,570
have access to the teachers computers

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,250
who have quality assurance my ankle's

00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,030
all is the portuguese company which has

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,420
many

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:32,540
of Linux installations and most

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:35,030
important we are the the help from

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,330
usability team's special this one and I

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,810
refer here which made focus group

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,280
interaction usability reports and

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,090
basically we had to make sure that kids

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,489
and teachers actually wanted to use and

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:52,190
we're ready to use this Linux

00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:55,580
distribution I think it's very important

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:58,910
when these kind of deployments is to

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,820
choose a killer app and it shows super

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,970
talks okay it's not very educational but

00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,170
kids love it and we wanted that kids

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,459
love it so that they can they will

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,640
choose to boot to Linux super tix sender

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,019
super talks except we made some

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,390
developments on top of it we made sure

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:20,650
the download and upload of levels

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,700
through the interface of the game itself

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,530
diplo device course through the game

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,269
interface also to a web page so that

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,340
everybody wants to upload their ice

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,049
cores can check it out on the web page

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,640
so everybody can keep track i am better

00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:35,269
than you and all of that have more coins

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,780
that kind of thing red mutual yet full

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:41,390
portuguese supports language wise and we

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,459
had a support web page for the the ice

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,440
cores and all of that to the download

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,860
and a pod of levels also through the the

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,320
web page and all of that this was the

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,110
first version of the magellan dmg one

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,989
those three hundred thousand computers

00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:59,720
that I talked about it was about two

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,459
years ago he it was still kd3 so we had

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,420
the super karambit teen displaying the

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,760
main applications we have the cash

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:11,090
market 12 which is the our linux version

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,760
at the time Thunder kd3 falar where

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:17,720
supports a larger interface bar so kids

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,250
could see things better there was and

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,400
there still is a recovery system from

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,500
our disks so if someone just messes up

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,990
with the system it's easy to make it al

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,310
all as it was when they receive it then

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,750
you have an easy to install this

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,850
software from where I click on install

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,540
system which you didn't have and we made

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,700
it for that version this is

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,860
the latest versions the one who is just

00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,960
installed in this one they have it's

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,810
basically I skied eforcity dad's as a

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,510
plasmoid plasmoids this is the example

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,190
that uses cash magica 14 which is

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,280
implied this version of cash image you

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,930
get the time now we have high 15 KD for

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,820
flood where support including a light

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,040
sensor which the first version of the

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,830
Magellan didn't have and the ocp

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,620
supports for the wireless driver this

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,300
version of the Magellan is installed on

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,920
the first hardware version of the

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,720
Magellan we made sure it's totally

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,490
compatible so everyone has the first

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,440
Russian can install this version on it

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,120
and have all the bells and whistles of

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,620
this one then it has a graphical

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,470
recovery system from eg the other one

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,050
was text mode the same cursor system

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,410
this one has a better one so why do

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:25,020
people one we went to the button to cash

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,810
america and not windows first look and

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,670
feel this is a plasmid bye-bye too much

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,340
can a brother which is a multi folder

00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,860
view this is basically reading a folder

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,640
to as the desktop files in it and it

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:41,310
just shows them you have a clock widget

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,690
which is actually running it is a still

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,430
shot but you cannot see it but if you

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,470
want you can see it here it's actually

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,980
working on the desktop integrated the

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:54,060
second pointer is working well the team

00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,980
made by nuna Piero and we have the kiddy

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,950
desktop effect standards enabled by

00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:01,620
default then we have things that we

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,210
needed to make sure we're like this so

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,250
it was easier for people to use one

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,900
application per task is essential great

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,230
system I'm type handling browser mime

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,150
type handling easy parental controls for

00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,820
access control application control and

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,520
time usage control timekeeper and some

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,040
developments we made ourselves Gregan

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,990
simple games for children we referring

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,560
to the full localize to português

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,750
portugal portuguese 4g compri desktop

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,640
lockdown make sure that people don't

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,020
mess around with the next stop too much

00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,490
because they usually don't know how to

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,830
put it back together like for instance

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,630
removing the plasmoid of the main

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,730
applications and of course good

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,400
localization and language consistency

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,100
across menus it's important people read

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,800
the same thing for the

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,410
saying for different applications they

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,070
know open here open like that not open

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,570
application because another thing people

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:56,090
don't really understand if things are

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,040
not written in the same way for the

00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,960
musical for the teachers computer

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,570
because it's computers for teachers

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,160
first for students but also for teachers

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,560
and they have to use it in the classroom

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,000
so we have the easy way to configure the

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,250
teachers computer as an access point

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,430
because not all classrooms have wireless

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,010
and some of them don't really work so

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,120
the teacher computer is very easily

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:21,890
configured as an access point so the

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,350
students computers can use it then we

00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,360
have breached Confucius shared folder on

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,980
the teachers computer so also kids just

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,930
click open a folder and it's the

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,520
computers and the teachers folder they

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,470
placed documents there whatever they

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,180
want simple I talked clients and server

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,760
configuration I talk is a way for the

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,770
teacher to see the desktops of the

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,290
students you make sure we had a very

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,420
simple way to pass the authentication

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,920
keys that i taught server needs to

00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,080
connect to the students and you also

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,260
made sure that the ital client is always

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,820
ramming a never computer when do you

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,560
have a classroom management software

00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,260
made by a portuguese company which is

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,880
basically a PHP software that is running

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,670
on the teachers computer and which

00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,700
students access very easily so we had to

00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:10,790
make sure that we add all the software

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,770
that teachers would use it would were to

00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,950
use it on the classroom and it was

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:18,290
actually usable and we also have to make

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,600
sure that the kids wanted to boots

00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:24,350
either to play or to use any classroom

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,330
also with this computer we have to make

00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,420
one of the things that I say in follow

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,650
max is is that first musical in desktop

00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,840
no clattering don't place too many

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,250
things on the on the desktop just place

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,380
the essential things and that's it

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,599
people don't want to see many things

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,580
that go because they don't know it they

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,530
won't use it if they don't know it one

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,570
application per task is essential don't

00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,480
put too many things even though some are

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,890
better than others for other tasks who

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,320
can feel is essential the first time

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,760
they put the computer if they see

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,930
not-so-pretty desktop they won't use it

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,070
even if it's a lot better than the other

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,020
simplify everything even if losing

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,230
configuration options we will move some

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,960
of the configuration i'll click with the

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,320
right mouse button because people just

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,940
didn't know what to do with them so we

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,510
remove them simply from context menus

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,160
they don't need it if they need it they

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,080
usually don't I have to think that this

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,960
is for kids teaches people that are not

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,240
very computer friendly that of a simple

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,560
file sometimes for instance we have to

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,590
certain we thought about using

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,020
openoffice for kids d ended up using a

00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:32,020
standard open office because teachers in

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,180
our focus groups thought the deed they

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,760
lose too many functionalities and okay

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,990
will you stand it up an office keep in

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,580
mind that although it's designed for

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,040
young children teaching parents will use

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,930
it to this is very important because

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,490
these for children but they are not the

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,340
only ones that's going to use it think

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,820
that have at least 2002 killer apps that

00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,290
will make kids use it or even teachers

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,530
that are not found on the other

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:59,350
operating system and the most important

00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,570
thing use focus groups whatever you want

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,120
but test your system before releasing it

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,540
with real teachers real kids in a real

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,710
classroom and make sure they they can

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,690
use it they use it in a easy way they

00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,970
understand what is on your desktop

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,890
without the need for someone to tell

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,720
them and all the configuration things

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,670
they have to do our simple click next

00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,710
next next to start next next next to

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,270
stop whatever and that's it because they

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,730
know what they want you can only guess

00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:31,180
unfortunately we on the developing

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,500
silence developing sides a lot of times

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,690
think that we know what people want

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:47,370
that's not absolutely not true

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:51,600
that's it any questions rest of the

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:53,579
presentation of that question because it

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,519
is a dual boot system people can still

00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:58,529
put into windows why do they still boot

00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:05,360
into windows are both are the most

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:09,240
important applications windows well

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,920
although we do have a lot of I'm sorry

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,290
I'm going to repeat the question exactly

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,180
what why are people still booting in

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:18,329
windows and not only using Linux what

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,740
are the main applications they still

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:22,019
have in Windows that they don't have in

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,700
Linux well the first thing it's

00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,410
basically not the question of

00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,660
applications it's a question of people

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:31,050
no windows and they don't know the Linux

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,700
so they just put to what they know okay

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,709
this is the first thing and we're

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,120
talking about how much a school teachers

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:38,010
that really don't have the time and

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,170
don't have the patience the patience to

00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,000
learn anything new just just want to use

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,560
what they know so they just put two

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,170
windows it doesn't matter what it has

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,800
and that's a problem with ever linux

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,680
distribution in every project the other

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,910
thing is in Windows there are other

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,839
pronoun their progress and other

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,880
applications there is a needle stack for

00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:03,329
the classroom that basically uses the

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,890
same thing that we do with I talk and J

00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:09,000
compri and all of that they have inner

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:11,880
in magic desktop things which is a

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,880
little prettier but although it doesn't

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,370
work very well but people just and then

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,470
Microsoft made a lot of press about all

00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,079
of their features which are just

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,320
standard features and we started always

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,470
hard for us to make sure to push clinics

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,470
around

00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:32,929
yes did you get any negative feedback

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,540
confirms perhaps who we want their

00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:36,920
children to learn windows is absolutely

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,680
more useful in the market is perhaps

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,800
rather be a perception that you

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,570
a job you want

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,220
see that they probably have the best ah

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,190
I'm sorry I repeat the question did you

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,610
have a negative feedback for poor

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:58,070
parents because they want what everybody

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,860
is using Windows is using is used in the

00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,980
marketplace and not linux so they don't

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,050
want use linux because of that well

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,339
actually no actually no because since

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:12,470
it's for younger kids there isn't that

00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:14,980
negative perception yet so when a

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:19,310
teacher uses linux in the classroom

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:21,350
there isn't they are not very it doesn't

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,420
matter if it's linux or windows at least

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:27,140
another focus group when you use it

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:33,500
there is no negative conception that a

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:38,450
link with middle school didn't come into

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:40,790
you have been accessed these people if

00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,640
it's difficult for young people that

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,990
started with Linux to have passed to

00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,510
windows because it's what they have in

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,310
schools and all of that no I didn't have

00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:52,820
any feedback negative feedback for that

00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:54,860
and I mean it shouldn't have I don't

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,370
think there should you have any feedback

00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,740
with that because that's our government

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,870
fortunately supports open-source very

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,990
well and we have other projects with our

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,720
company and other companies for laptops

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,780
usually normal laptops for older kids

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,610
with also which also have linux

00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,590
installed and school there are many

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,900
projects so most computers have dual

00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,900
boot installation so based in there

00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:31,910
or windows I cook yeah so if I'm

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,950
repeating the question the kid who is

00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,930
working Linux at school and it goes home

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,930
it has only a mac OS or Windows system

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,760
it's different we didn't have any

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,640
negative feedback on that so I'm not

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,390
sure if it's a problem maybe it is but I

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,390
really don't

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:57,440
yeah how many kids actually used the

00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,900
linux linux version i really don't have

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,840
any real numbers what we do is our

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:06,950
support line which is a only on second

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:11,000
level support we receive about 20 calls

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:13,460
a day about it which usually very simple

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,380
questions things that they don't know

00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,690
how to do in Linux and sometimes and

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:23,090
most of the times I'd wear problems that

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:26,270
were passed strongly to to our line okay

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:28,690
okay sorry thank you thank you very much

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,690
