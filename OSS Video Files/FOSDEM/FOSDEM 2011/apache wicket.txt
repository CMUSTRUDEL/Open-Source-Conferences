	by Martijn Dashorts 

Apache Wicket is a component oriented Java web framework. With proper mark-up/logic separation, a POJO data model, and a refreshing lack of XML, Wicket makes developing web-apps simple and enjoyable again.

This talk provides a short introduction to the framework's concepts: components, behaviors and models. We'll take a short look at integrating with Spring and integrating with JQuery. For the test infected we'll cover testing your web pages with Wicket's internal test framework. But most importantly we'll take a look at the new Wicket release 1.5 and see what has changed for the better and worse
