hello and please let me begin my speech

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:25,650
with my thanks to the organizer of this

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:29,730
event and for the work I also would like

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:33,480
to thank them to let me present our work

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,090
today because it is very very outside of

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,890
what you have what you are used to

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:43,620
present here i am eric mikela i'm a

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,760
french medical doctor working on an

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,640
emergency department i am a c++ QT

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,100
developer and the main creator of the

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,390
free Matt film project and actually the

00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:01,140
main developer to Jim Boozer who helped

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:05,670
on the preparation of this presentation

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:09,000
is a Canadian physician he is part of

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,990
the kumud project and join our team last

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,170
year you can find all information about

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:22,860
our project on our web main website and

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:28,650
I'm used to to present medical things

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:32,280
and you will maybe found this

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,090
presentation too many or not enough but

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:42,360
I would like you to fit this like very

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:45,030
interesting okay so Frimet form is a

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,590
suite of medical application we

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,119
including an electronic medical record a

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,259
prescriber and drug interaction checker

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,110
there are other application available

00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:03,780
actually we have an accountancy manager

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:08,250
that is on the way and some clinical

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,470
coding assistance the project is driven

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,560
by a community of medical doctors and

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,590
computer scientists and workers

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,470
over the birth of a French team the all

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:23,000
applications of the project are freely

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:27,690
available with the full source code

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,599
listen said in GPL three we are actually

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:34,200
supported by open suse medical and

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,880
Debian med teams we hope that federal

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:44,459
medical will include us in their work

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:47,810
soon as possible so when free met former

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,720
started a special attention was paid to

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:54,840
drug-drug interaction management

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:58,590
drug-drug interaction we identify the

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,760
source data freely available from

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:05,819
governmental agencies and from a review

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,080
of literature's as the open source

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:13,560
community lacked a free stand-alone

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:20,489
prescriber software we decided to create

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:24,049
it using the prescriber plug-in of the

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,850
free Matt form electronic medical record

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:29,970
it is called freedoms freedom is

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:33,870
actually stable and usable in current

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:36,989
practice free germs allowed to a user to

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,609
create complex prescription and test

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,609
drug in drug drug interactions

00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:51,990
so all applications are available for

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,800
Linux Mac OS windows and maybe freebsd

00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:59,760
we have an issue with the air path if

00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:07,520
someone wants to work on this the

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:10,710
project is a c++ using QT libraries and

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:15,440
the massive usage of Model View

00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:19,590
controller architecture is the central

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:22,200
of the of the application all

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:26,190
applications on builded using dynamic

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,680
libraries and plugins architecture we

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,380
are actually using only escalate for

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,190
local database drug database interaction

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:39,960
database and passion database mysql

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:43,200
version is on the way all road maps is

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:47,340
used and specification of applications

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:52,350
are available on our main website so

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:55,680
here is what i can present you today how

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:59,130
does work free matt form free Matt form

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:05,550
is a really small executable just like

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:08,760
QT creator link it to many liberals we

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:14,690
have the medical utilities library which

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:20,010
contains the most medical calculations

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:23,730
utilities contained helpers jello

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:27,180
CalPERS message loggers and MVC alpers

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:30,570
and some other why gets the translation

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:33,330
library contains all the translatable

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,180
strings so you don't have to worry in

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:41,160
your code about translate these

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:44,280
translate this the interaction system

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:48,510
library is extracted from the Qt creator

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:53,120
project and adapted to our project it

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,120
contains the plugins manager

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:06,790
whoo so at startup time plugins manager

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:09,310
does load every plugins of the free Matt

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:14,370
form project of the phrygians both

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,370
applications use the same code and

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:28,080
interdependency of plugins is managed by

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:31,810
the plug-in manager i have here

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,820
represented some channels of

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,600
communication between some plugins that

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,300
defining the drug interaction angina we

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,740
have the main window and drugs plugins

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:48,940
which are mainly the user interface and

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:53,650
the drug bath plugin which owns all drug

00:06:48,940 --> 00:07:02,920
interactions and join and which is the

00:06:53,650 --> 00:07:05,170
one who goes such data from database all

00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,380
plugins can communicate with the core

00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:12,420
plugin Corrigan is a central place of

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:16,260
the application there is a singular and

00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:19,600
unique instance of I call interface co

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:23,170
which gives you access to the interface

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:27,940
patient that give you access to all

00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:30,630
patients that are and calculations so if

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:37,330
drug bars needs some information here

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:39,910
Pass is designed adhere how does work

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:44,160
the drug interaction engine this is

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:48,340
really easy the interaction enjoying

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:52,780
analyze all combination of drugs /

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:55,170
cooper each active substance of drugs

00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,970
are linked it to an

00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:01,240
internationally-recognized Tynan my

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,490
notes here coding system and persistent

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,479
over time called

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:12,099
TC TC means anatomical therapeutical

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:15,960
chemical the atc classification is owned

00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:20,699
and listen Ted by the World Health

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:23,970
Organization so when the link is done

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:29,740
the drug interaction I'm Jane can

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:32,649
calculate all interactions so as you can

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,940
see the first work that we have the

00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:44,020
medical team have to do here is to link

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:51,580
active substance to Anatomy to a TC TC

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:53,399
is widely recognized the drug

00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,740
interaction enjoying calculates

00:08:53,399 --> 00:09:00,459
interaction in real time so each time

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,920
users add or remove a drug our

00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:06,610
interactions are recalculated this is

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,899
easy because it is just an integral list

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:13,410
of integer to compare to compare and

00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:21,160
those are stored so you can easily

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:25,410
recall them we build two different tips

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:30,760
of a lot to limit the alert fatigue

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:33,100
aliphatic the Ralad fatigue is well

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,640
known and defined as a phenomenon caused

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,420
by excessive warnings including a

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:44,589
revelant nonsignificant our repetitious

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:48,490
alerts that can lead practitioner to

00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:50,920
override all alerts so the drug

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:58,360
interaction doesn't let me make sense if

00:09:50,920 --> 00:10:01,660
all alerts are over right okay so we

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,890
define to kind of adds one dynamic a lot

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:09,220
who need the user validation to proceed

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:12,790
and one static a lot that is just a

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,940
remembrance by icons in the different

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,940
view

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,370
these islets can be easily configurated

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:29,810
their level in the application

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:33,589
preference so as the open source medical

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:37,009
community lacks free prescriber and drug

00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:40,670
interaction tester we decided to create

00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:45,100
an interoperability to phrygians using

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:49,670
xml exchange file and the common line so

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:52,399
external non-free met forms electronic

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:56,629
medical record can call freedom and

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,389
retrieve data from it free met form does

00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:03,050
not have to worry about this because it

00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:05,660
it is a plugins of it if you have a

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:08,839
web-based the electronic medical record

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,360
we are starting to create a open react

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:15,680
web service which is written in java

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:20,199
using the same data does with the the

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:23,300
conjunction of the free med team and

00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:26,660
care two eggs and synapse LMAO we hope

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:31,160
that some new team would come here blue

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:35,089
med and mailing checks LMAO already use

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,339
the interoperability of free jams here

00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:42,040
is a screenshot of freedoms we have at

00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:44,930
the top the patient data the plus button

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,509
toggles a detailed view of the patient

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:50,509
when you want to prescribe you always

00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:52,850
want to know the patient precautions we

00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:55,220
have here all drugs allergy drugs

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:58,689
intolerance and in future versions we

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:02,839
will have disease coded disease of

00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:05,839
patient active not active all allergies

00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:11,089
are our insurance can be coded using the

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:14,350
ITC called the class classification the

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:19,040
drugs the name or the international

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:21,949
non-proprietary names we are here the

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,410
template manager a template is a full

00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:28,019
complex prescription that can be easily

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:32,639
reused using the drag and drop

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:36,819
functionality here is the content of the

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:43,660
atrial fibrillation without heart

00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:47,110
failure here is the last green screen

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:49,269
shot of this talk the drug drug

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:53,619
interaction synthesis dialogue because

00:12:49,269 --> 00:13:00,029
we want to have something to a simple

00:12:53,619 --> 00:13:06,869
view all interactions are selectable

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:10,540
here and full risk information and

00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:15,339
management texts are provided in in two

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:17,879
languages French and English I thank Jim

00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:23,670
booster for his help on translating

00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:27,189
every French messages here here are the

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:32,799
interacting drugs related to this

00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:36,639
interaction lavell is remembered here by

00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:40,059
icons you can choose what level you want

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,959
to see here you have a link to the main

00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:45,819
source of drug interaction used to

00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:48,790
calculate this when you click on

00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:51,549
bibliography for some of drug

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:56,160
interaction provided by the female form

00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:59,110
team you can have a full pubmed

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,509
bibliography including the full

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:07,540
reference and the complete abstract went

00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:11,160
available this was a really hard work so

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:14,529
I am here because I need you we need you

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,040
