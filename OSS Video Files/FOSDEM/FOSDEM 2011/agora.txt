	00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:12,509
talk about a grow button system for a

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,309
liquid democracy adorable teen system

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,180
while it comes from parte de internet

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,820
and political in ok the de main idea of

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,230
this political party is that the member

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:29,310
of the Parliament of elected for this

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:32,099
dis party will both the well the people

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:36,000
vote over internet the they work as

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,040
proxy rip representatives and they for

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,989
doing this you don't need to change any

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,020
law also the idea is behind this is

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,789
liquid democracy which is just like

00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,640
giant democracy but with the legation

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,620
because you can't you don't have time to

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,550
bolt everything that happens in the

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,640
parliament so the party on internet

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,190
created this this software al-gaddafi

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,670
donna which of course has some

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,159
requirements first one is security of

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,460
course the bottom system is to be secure

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,820
but what does it doesn't mean it means

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,820
that the boat must be secret that's the

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,460
first thing the you need to be sure that

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:25,500
you your ballot your boat will be

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:28,710
currently captured and also another of

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,400
the requirements is that we need to

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,909
support massive elections there are 45

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,790
46 millions of people in Spain and also

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,189
massive election means to think that

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,930
there are also not many people that bad

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:48,270
a lot of Bolton's a year seven thousand

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:50,759
in the Congress so the botton sister

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,100
need to be to support this kind of thing

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,219
and of course the the first thing that

00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:00,689
needs need to be supported other as a

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:03,570
requirement is both delegation so how

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:06,420
the voting system that we are creating

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,640
how how does it work well this is the

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,459
bottom process first we have the

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,830
trustees which has which are the people

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,250
or the entities we trust

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,700
are the secrecy of our boat this

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:25,530
entities could be the United Nations

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:31,650
people Greenpeace or a political parties

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:34,110
so they should they should be of any all

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,570
kinds of organizations and people so

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,470
because the assistant warrant is that

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:43,590
only if all of them collaborate at an

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:48,480
accurate then you're both one be secret

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:51,540
so as it needs to be difficult to be the

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,140
this collaboration for corrupting the

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:58,530
voting to happen and then for aborting

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,830
we need to generate a adjoint key each

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,490
of these and trustees generate that

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:09,440
public and private key and afterwards

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:12,959
they publish it shown the publish in the

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,880
public key in the bulletin board where

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,610
used in alias voting system for for this

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,950
elias is made by benedita arms his

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,130
colleagues in in harvard his a

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,430
geographer and then we have the

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:33,180
delegates as this button system spots a

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:36,930
delegation of the boat the distillate

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,269
delegates need to publish well the

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,420
legate's could be anyone could be you

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,580
could be a political party or any

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,280
personal orders lesyk or even an

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,890
organization and the boat map must be

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,830
made public before the lesson begins so

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,709
you know why are you going to vote if

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,750
you julie gate in these people and then

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,640
the button starts and you can either

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:04,440
delegate your boat or you can jolly boat

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,570
your ballot when you're both over the

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,840
internet or your ballot will be

00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:15,600
encrypted by using el-gamal which is a

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,970
standard way from creating a boat or

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,289
whatever and then it will be signed we

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,770
used electronic national electronic

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:27,420
identification cards in spain which use

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,970
a standard protocol son

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,740
there they are working the is secure and

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,750
it will design with your signature so

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,720
the boat which is encrypted so that no

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,130
one will know what you really boat will

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,200
be signing everyone will know that

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,080
that's your boat and not everyone else

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,790
and finally when you send your ballot

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,550
that you create in your computer you

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,910
even without internet in a computer with

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:58,980
a live CD if you want you send it over

00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:02,970
internet is out in case using the euro

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:05,040
signature and cast by the server and of

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,490
course published in the balloting board

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,700
so for everyone to see then the Bolton

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:16,560
ends and the tally begins the trustees

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,750
now start work again and the the way it

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,680
works the bottom system is that each

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:26,820
trustee shuffles the boat and we encrypt

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:30,180
the ballots so that the the ballots are

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,340
animal analyzed no one will know that

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,600
this ballot was this other ballot

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,700
because it's been recreated and and

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,680
shuffled this is what we call a mixed

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:46,140
net each of the trustees do this process

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,290
collaborating and in the end when we

00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,030
have a list of ballots which are

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,840
shuffled and we encrypted than one will

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:57,960
know which is which then we can decrypt

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,980
the ballots this this is also a word

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,490
that is done by the trustees doing a

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:08,190
decryption distributing and of the end

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,690
of the night spots and of course these

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,530
results must be published in the

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:16,980
balloting bar but you you get the proofs

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,080
of the shin proof of the of the

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,510
shuffle that was correctly done and

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,300
they're rien Christian of course so you

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:28,590
can warranty even if the bottom is

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:33,530
corrupt you know that you that that the

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:36,720
this process worked or not because the

00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,550
mathematics behind this warrant it

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,249
briefly cartoon is the system that we

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:47,219
use for all these mathematical

00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:50,189
complex processes and this is done by

00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:52,589
people from photographers this offer is

00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:56,339
done by cryptographers from from

00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:59,489
switzerland and this proves i have

00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,409
mentioned earlier provide as i said a

00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:03,629
universal belly affiliate very

00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:07,079
affability so even if the botanist

00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:10,829
corrupt you will know it yeah maybe you

00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:13,399
both will be will be known it will be

00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:16,709
sacred secret because all the trustees

00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:22,079
are corrupt but you will know that the

00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:24,769
botton is corrupt and this is a serious

00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,329
stuff we have a paper painting because

00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:29,729
there are a lot of secure button system

00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:31,469
people don't know this but this it's

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:34,139
true there a lot of secure coding system

00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:37,589
but they don't provide the delegation

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:41,359
and we are we are creating in this in

00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:45,239
this project paper that we are going to

00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:49,019
to present as soon as possible for that

00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:50,909
that provides this this dedication and

00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:53,999
of course this kind of thing is funding

00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:56,749
but we're on to that we are trying to

00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:59,999
create a foundation for liquid democracy

00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:03,059
of course this voting system when is

00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,499
finished which we are working on we can

00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:07,669
be used anywhere can be used in

00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:11,149
universities and colleagues even in

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:14,909
companies to boat whatever you want

00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:17,849
actually an alias voting system from

00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:20,789
Harvard that we are going to use as well

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:23,399
with with very few konnen having uses

00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:26,099
used already in universities for boating

00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,559
directors in france and i don't know

00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:31,159
what are other places the status of the

00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:34,019
project well we've been working in the

00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:40,229
delegation method which is really the

00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:42,289
most difficult thing since the 2009 and

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,509
now we have a clear path we want to use

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:49,559
elias and verificar tomb which is the

00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:52,379
fastest software for for processing the

00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,260
boats and we are doing just that and

00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:59,420
also integrating the

00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:01,430
education in alias for the DNA so well

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,300
if you are interested wanna join us this

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:07,520
is our web page and you can contact me

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:38,050
via my email so if there are any

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:38,050
questions or how is it working the the

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:49,070
trust the trustees and all the question

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:52,100
is how I don't know if I understood

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:55,960
currently how how the trust works

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,960
actually how

00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:14,709
of course this so we provide the

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,500
software they can create your own if the

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:19,899
one because there is a protocol but we

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,720
we have to provide them a software to do

00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:26,740
the shuffle and the encryption and the

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,380
decryption and and they can use it or

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:33,519
they can created their own software that

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:44,350
I don't trust it or whatever and that's

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:48,250
it yeah yeah consequence no no the

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:54,430
bottom the this the the question is that

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:57,480
that that I said that the trustees have

00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:00,790
to ring creeped the the boats and

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,060
shuffle them and the question is does

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:06,279
does this rien Shin need to decrypt

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,790
the ball to encrypt it and the answer is

00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:15,399
now the the el-gamal encryption permits

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:18,339
a to re-encrypt a boat sirasa anything a

00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:21,610
text we felt having to decrypt it so you

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:24,639
know that the two texts the cipher text

00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:27,490
contained the same they're saying the

00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:32,170
same thing inside but you don't know

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:36,610
what it is no actually no you just

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:40,089
decrypt the last one once and and it is

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:45,449
decrypted is a property of the this

00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:45,449
encryption process another question

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:57,060
the question is when will this be

00:11:54,269 --> 00:12:00,450
available well we don't know yet we hope

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,990
that a as soon as possible we are

00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:07,470
working their developers we have about

00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:10,820
three developers at the moment and the

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:14,430
the most difficult part was the

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:18,199
mathematics behind this and now we just

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:22,370
need to to to take the these projects

00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:27,300
Elias protein and verification and

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,889
authentication with DNA and in being

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,829
them together when we're working on that

00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:35,370
and we hope that at the end of this year

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:45,870
we have something I hope that another

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:49,740
question you you probably the question

00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:52,709
is that that's just a pallet inboard

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:56,250
contain who has both and who hasn't and

00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:58,709
the answer is yes you you you publish

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,360
your boat you sign your boats so

00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,279
everyone will know that you both you

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,640
they don't know what the you vote even

00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:08,970
do you might both station or it might be

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:18,890
the boat might contain a delegation but

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:18,890
yes yes any more questions okay

00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:39,810
the question is how how can we well he

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:43,060
said that normally you want to know if

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:46,360
the bottom was done currently or not how

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:49,720
do we do that well as i said we provide

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,570
the trustees provide a proof of what

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,300
they've done so you can check with this

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,829
proof that the process they did which of

00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,149
course you cannot repeat because you're

00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:01,660
another trustee you don't have the

00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:03,970
private key that they do but you can

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,630
check mathematically that they did it

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:11,380
currently and is a proof mathematical

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:13,720
proof is and actually the current

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,610
bolting system in most countries they

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,040
don't provide any kind of proof you just

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,839
need to trust that the process was right

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:30,570
but there is no mathematical proof of

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:30,570
anything any more questions where

00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:52,439
the question is that it would be most

00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:55,980
secure if we ultimately the trustees

00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:58,989
process and the answer is well you need

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,579
in the end you need a public and private

00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:07,389
keys and who who is in charge of those

00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:10,029
those keys you need someone so if

00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:13,509
possible I will do that that we need

00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:16,629
someone in charge so the idea is that we

00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:19,259
put a lot of people in charge that are

00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:25,079
not going to collaborate to be corrupt

00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:25,079
