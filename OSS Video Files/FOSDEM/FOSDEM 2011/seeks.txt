well i'm going to give you very short

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,059
and brief overview the six project

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,910
what you'll get is a sort of a one path

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,950
to a possible take back of web search

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,770
the way you know firefox took back the

00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:27,860
web this take back is a long long work

00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:30,239
it's a hard work it'd be difficult but

00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,980
that's the best that I know and that's

00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,469
the best that I work with with a bunch

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,210
of people so this is why i'm going to

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,430
show you and maybe we'll be convinced

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,260
that the free software community and us

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,410
and hackers and you know developers blah

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,320
blah we can do something about it oops

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,109
okay so as you know we have something

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,300
fantastic at our fingertips we have the

00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:56,999
the most connected human-built network

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,159
of recorded history this it's the

00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:03,059
internet and on this network with

00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:05,640
basically a massive flow of data and

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:11,250
this data we can categorize them into in

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:13,380
two categories human generated and human

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,680
target targeted data and

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,350
machine-to-machine theta n so in this

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,580
context what is search search is this

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:28,350
basic operation for humans to look up

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,430
some human targeted content throughout

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,820
this massive amount of data okay such as

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:37,980
this fascinating characteristic that we

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,440
all depend on it you know most of the

00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,590
time we look at we have something to do

00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,810
to Google or Bing whatever search engine

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,450
before we even ask our friends so we're

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,680
really dependent on these engines and

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:55,560
also the level of techna city that is

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,440
required and the usage that is required

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,850
by users to use this engine is as low

00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,740
variance what it means that whether

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,870
you're my mother or your power searcher

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,370
so-called power searcher the tools that

00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,980
you're using the way you're using google

00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,989
or any other engine is is it's almost

00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,659
the same right the polyester trade maybe

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,580
a little bit better but it's that's

00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:17,580
almost the same so what happens is we

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,580
we are all dependent on search and we

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,840
all use it and if you're lucky do not

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,210
have understood or seen this before as

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,190
users will locked up and we locked up in

00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,440
several ways first because we're

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,720
interacting with black boxes proprietary

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,110
black boxes which means that basically

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,730
you've all experienced this typing in

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,370
some key words getting some results back

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,040
in a satisfied with the results you

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,090
change the key word you get another

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,650
query and so on and so on and you

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,300
integrate that until you get satisfied

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,590
sometimes you just get garbage right and

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,940
the machine will never tell you that you

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,350
got garbage because the machine will

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,380
never tell you that she doesn't know but

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,240
it doesn't voxel okay so you can't get

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,990
feedback that's that's the first look up

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,790
you the second lockup is very important

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,100
to me it's basically we're all doing the

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,250
same queries over and over again in our

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,440
own corner we're isolated okay if I look

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,120
for something and I read the forum and I

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,430
find at the end of the form that the

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,350
answer to my question is not there the

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,090
hundred or the thousands of people

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,400
behind me who are going to do the same

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,720
query well they'll do the same thing

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,900
right I'll go through the form and read

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,420
it again so we isolated the third look

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,170
up is that we're all experts in

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,670
something right we looks things on we

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,100
type in queries to these search engines

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,690
and we're all experts in something but

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,220
with this still our queries to these

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,780
search engines and we keep nothing on

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,480
our machine jar so we don't build

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:47,850
profiles of expertise that should be

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,769
ours so the point here is truly web

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,480
search is lagging behind and and there

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,400
are reasons for this I'll trying to tell

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,750
you on but the way I can convince you

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,120
that it's lagging behind its era where

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,000
millions even billions of users and

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,820
every day there is an estimated 1

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,250
billion query being issued in the search

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,530
engines and of course these guys they're

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,010
rooted in reality right we're looking in

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,590
the InfoSphere for things that are real

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,510
recipes medicines whatever right but

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,500
we're looking for something real and

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,560
since we're looking for something real

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,930
with many of us

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,360
we're looking for similar things right

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,010
but we cannot interact there's no

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,100
feedback we cannot share our queries

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:30,669
like we can share something else so what

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,560
is 66 is an open architecture and it's a

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:36,940
free software application that tries to

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:41,230
fill the gap in web search by making it

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:42,970
collaborative making it social and the

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,540
main idea is that the social web search

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,940
is inevitable it will happen whether six

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,460
succeeds or whether some of the people

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,380
come up with better ideas it doesn't

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,389
matter in the end will do search

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:59,080
together okay the way we do some other

00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:01,450
things together the idea behind six the

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,600
main idea is very very simple it's very

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:07,870
natural to it is to regrip users who

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,370
perform similar or identical queries so

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,710
they can share and collaborate on the

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,050
results that's all this simple idea is

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,910
many interesting consequences so I'll

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,130
try to describe six with just this slide

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,620
very briefly basically what happens is a

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:23,260
six regroups people in real time in

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,510
so-called search groups around similar

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,890
queries okay so people who type similar

00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,560
queries they get regrouped in surg

00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,880
groups these search groups these people

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,070
is in the circle they can work together

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,830
so we give them collaborative filtering

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:38,280
tools to work together so these tools

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,810
they allow them to exchange results

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,669
automatically or actively by clicking

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:47,530
but to recommend results to toss results

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,180
away to do a lot of things right so

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,300
basically it gives the ability to these

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,539
people to process data and and the third

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:59,350
point is very interestin is we allow

00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:01,930
some users to push some more data to the

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,400
search groups for them to process so you

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,110
let me give you an example if you have a

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,580
blog and you're right a new entry to

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,800
your blog what you're going to do is

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,270
you're going to devise like a few

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,860
queries at least one query that

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,690
describes your new entry of your blog

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,520
you're going to do that you know typing

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,710
the aquarian 26 you're going to regret

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,120
with people who did similar queries but

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,740
instead of looking at the results that

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,450
you get from the search engine you'll

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,430
push your content okay you'll say hey

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,650
this is a potential new result for you

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,300
guys if you've been lying it means if

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,860
your if your quarry is not in an

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,650
equation with the content you'll get

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,650
tossed

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,060
people say okay that's that's that's

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,790
garbage we don't want it if you do this

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,500
two groups the filtering and the

00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,479
publication to the groups you can build

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,699
a real-time collaborative and fair

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,479
search engine fair because anyone can

00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:51,169
push some data okay okay the important

00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:53,090
thing why do we need to do it if social

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:56,210
web search you know social works is a

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,430
simple idea why doesn't exist you know

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,160
all these big companies they could do it

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,930
there's one reason the business model of

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,610
these companies right the existing

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,979
engines they feed on user personal data

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,139
in exchange for the service will give

00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:12,110
you this data they used to target

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:14,240
advertising then generate revenues for

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,870
this engine sir so if you if you let

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,139
users share their queries and you know

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,789
be clustered into groups of people off

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:25,789
with similar interest and if you let

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:27,740
people push them some content give them

00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:30,229
some more content and results like

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,120
advertisers then these advertisers they

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:35,000
don't need to go through the existing

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,880
pay walls like Adwords or some others

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,760
they don't need to go to these

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,570
centralized entities and pay and pay the

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,479
fee to be able to push their results so

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,590
so basically what happens is that these

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,270
existing search engines because of the

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,919
business models that I have that work

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,620
but you know because these business

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:59,780
models they will never do it and the

00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:03,050
proof the fact is that today with things

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,210
that you may like we don't work in a

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,680
matter like Facebook and others they

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,289
still lagging behind they haven't done

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,599
it okay then the lock up is this is

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,840
because they simply cannot do it okay

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,539
six dibs on a few principles I will

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,099
outline them very quickly the first one

00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,919
is if you want to take back web search

00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:24,650
you got to give more control to users

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,570
over the the search algorithms where six

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,070
does is that it groups it regroups the

00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,990
people so they're together once they're

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,909
together they can work together and they

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:36,650
have more control over their results in

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:38,729
the algorithms the second thing is

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:42,039
transparency

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:44,560
since transparency means that you're

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,149
able to modify the equations the ranking

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,120
the way the way the ranking is done in

00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:51,070
the engine freely okay you do not have

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,760
to rely on proprietary code and

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:57,430
equations and let your results being

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,680
ranked by them so the way six does this

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,730
is that it's a free software so it's one

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,860
of the reason why it's a free software

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,339
it's a free software and so it lets you

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,660
do do change the code as you want and

00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:13,029
this does not impact the other users

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,190
also the third principle is fairness in

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:18,279
constant deployment by letting people

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:20,920
push some results to the search group so

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:25,060
people who search similar content as

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,949
they do this removes the crawlers so we

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,430
don't need to recopy you copy the web

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:31,750
every five minutes again and again ok so

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,850
you remove the crawlers we're on the

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:37,449
we're pushing more data to the to the to

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:39,880
the groups but also it's it's more fair

00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:42,790
because anyone can push some data ok

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,260
we're not dependent on the SEOs or if

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,269
you have more money than others you can

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,510
you know make your website better so

00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:51,970
it's well recognized by the existing

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,279
crawlers finally the one of the most

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:57,279
important points at six takes the user

00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,959
privacy very seriously and for this

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,540
reason it builds a decentralized

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,790
architecture ok six relies on the

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,010
peer-to-peer network the way works that

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,600
you install six on your machine you

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,940
don't need like a it can be a desktop a

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,070
laptop it can be a Shiva blood it works

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,600
on all these devices you insult six on

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,300
your machine and we learn from your

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,800
behavior and navigation and also from

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,560
your queries are you tapping in every

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,449
day and it will build a profile for you

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,490
a filter through which you look at the

00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:27,459
results from other search engines or

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,990
whatever feeds you using these profiles

00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,550
over the peer-to-peer network they

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,830
exchange fragments of information

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,920
through the surge groups to help each

00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,529
other's improve your results and get

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,370
some more similar recommendation and so

00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:43,339
that's the way it looks sorry for the

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,600
better okay that's actually so it looks

00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:47,450
just like another search engine right

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,300
you can use it every day you get no loss

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:54,350
of results like off quality of riddles

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,089
it uses existing engines to get results

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,430
you can use whatever other feeds you you

00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:01,029
want and see the little stars and the

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,279
recommendation on the rides they're like

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:08,360
their information that is shared by the

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:11,600
users okay so here's the roadmap the

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,060
first step was to build the which seems

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,490
in line knowledge is the only free

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,589
software meter search engine okay this

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:22,160
is done we can search for text image

00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:24,200
videos tweets there are some nice tools

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,269
built in and we're done with this this

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,339
is something you can install on your on

00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,130
your laptop on your desktop the second

00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:33,230
step which is coming up soon is there

00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,940
the rising of a peer-to-peer net that

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,130
connects all these six notes together

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,620
okay so whatever you're doing on your

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,959
machine if you let it do so it will have

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,450
an impact to other people searching

00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,459
similar things at yours and this in this

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,130
impact will be proportional to the

00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:53,360
similarity of your profile to some other

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:56,029
users profile okay the third step is

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,959
that you let on this network people push

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,430
some more contents to the search groups

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:06,430
fraying ourselves from the existing

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:09,890
engines and becoming more real time

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:12,530
the fourth step is like the step for the

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,630
end of time we'll probably never see

00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,070
okay well it's interesting though to

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,120
have it in mind so when you wake up in

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,720
the morning you know where you're going

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,210
if you let the Webster servers index

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,310
their own content and build queries that

00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,860
describe their contents and hook them up

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,690
on the search groups and push this

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,600
information to the search groups then

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:35,390
you free yourself completely from the

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,190
crawlers okay so that's where the end of

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,190
time we can move gradually it's long

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,110
path toward this end but this end should

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,090
work there's no technical reason why it

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,580
wouldn't work and in the end we would

00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:50,450
not indexed reindex the entire web was

00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:53,330
just chunky more active in the push our

00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,160
receive mode okay if you're interested

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,380
in the project you can test it you can

00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,700
test some public node 6 Steph are

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,800
there's some others you're going to on

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,020
their website 6 project that info they

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,390
have a bunch of like six nodes are

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,210
maintained by volunteers and you can

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:09,800
play with them on a day-to-day basis I

00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,900
mean I use it on the other day basis and

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,930
I'm a hardcore searcher and I have no

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,580
problem the quality of results is a in

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,100
my opinion even better than other

00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,410
engines you can get in touch with us on

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,290
IRC we have a bunch of interesting tasks

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,060
that need to be addressed so i'll give

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,770
you an overview here there if you like

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,750
peter pan or if you like distributed

00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,610
hash tables if you're I feel like

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,560
network security there are a lot of

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,560
interesting issues we need to address

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,500
database also replicated databases we

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,280
move slowly but surely and we need a lot

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,870
of different competencies the second

00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,130
point is machine learning if you like

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,220
machine learning if you want to learn

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:54,350
more about her shin learning and if

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,880
you're willing to participate please

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,500
come in there are a lot of interesting

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,330
tasks to be addressed and eventually

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,430
what you can do with six is that as it

00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,930
is a free software you can build the

00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,610
user interface of your dream you don't

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,250
need to rely that user interface that

00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,020
the existing engines give you a change

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,200
whenever they want right you can build

00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,250
whatever you want so I'm like C++

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,640
developer

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,080
I can't really design you eyes so I

00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,360
consider that this is a job for the

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,340
community and users to like do whatever

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,810
they want try whatever they want if it

00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,860
fails it fails if it's good it's good

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:32,990
and okay so that's all the the point

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,090
being come and help us if you like the

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:39,430
project and or try to use it and see if

00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,430
if it's any good for you thank

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:52,470
Turner spoke wow you can have time for

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,470
