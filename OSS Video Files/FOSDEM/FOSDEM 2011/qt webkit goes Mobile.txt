Title: qt webkit goes Mobile
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	by Kenneth Christiansen

WebKit is everywhere, on desktops, mobiles, - and as an integrated part of the Qt platform, it is on Linux-based MeeGo as well.

n this session we will quickly introduce the WebKit project, and look at why it has become so popular on the mobile platform. We will look at some of the mobile adaptions normally done by the different WebKit ports and at the work we have been doing in Qt WebKit to make it more fit for mobile usage.

Some of the technologies we will touch, includes: frame flattening, tiling (including challenges), viewport meta information, touch events and fuzzy hit testing.

We hope the session will make people aware of the importance of the Qt WebKit project and its mobile efforts; create discussions and use-cases that we can use for integrating even better with, in particular, open source projects targeting mobile usage and the open source community in general.


FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

make it pretty good mobile web browser

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,470
use your webcam I felt that the Bronson

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,260
blackberry torch and we just see more

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,920
and more it's also less food strumming

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:28,769
because a lot of peace is needed to me

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:31,170
is already in place so we talking with

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,660
Tony didn't form factor that a distal

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,239
browser or mobile device the screen is

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,780
usually quite small this makes more

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,300
water if we promise and we also do not

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:49,230
use a keyboard will use my mouse so that

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:50,879
may be different people you might say to

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,670
yourself well the monkey has a really

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,219
good into web browsers the track record

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,440
isn't really that you know you can say

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,420
about me but might be truth of actually

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,460
got a no he was the first company in the

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,559
phone web gets two more bottles to a

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,860
mobile platform and the hit that many

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,090
years ago and it did pretty well but

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,840
there's a lot of favors it's changed

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,950
since then since today is this why

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,200
fighter where there's next to tree G the

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,110
cost Panzer a lot cheaper than it used

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,060
to be if before p 1 unit using them and

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,140
this across on the mobile phone because

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,579
your Swedish law was really expensive

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,320
and it couldn't really render the reel

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,560
web page so you have to get these one

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,420
things but like limited content and it

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,299
wasn't me what you want one of these

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:44,100
phases chains today we have nice data

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:46,439
plans imagine robot screams maybe learn

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,550
different really interacting the

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,740
difference

00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:54,720
fingers right and we have two more

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,910
powerful devices so this means that

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,800
today we possible that picture real

00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:03,990
internet devices you're more screen real

00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,510
estate and are powerful more powerful

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,369
processors so you connected lotus blue

00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,690
pages can process them and show the

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:14,760
frontal collision but there's a large

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,460
challenge in making both walk across

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,760
first of all the men you spent a small

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,520
form-factor things just stuff it on the

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,680
screen I cut the ECMO page then you

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,720
might have to use to make it smaller and

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,630
then it takes off more than I will read

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,400
it so there's about different issues

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,600
another problem is loading the page from

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,340
the net we're having a solid connection

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,820
most have to understand and pass this

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,680
are slow processes they we have to go to

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,970
the day out space to figure out where

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,090
should the tech speed should be

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,790
refloated should it be a box here have

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,590
to do all this before we can paint I

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,690
think have to paint but that's very slow

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,570
in comparison with a desktop browser

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:01,590
what we haven't maybe a phone call

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,170
computer then there's something also

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,820
very very tough situation requires a

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,820
very responsive you may experience I'll

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,010
get into that a bit later also our

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,650
fingers are pretty huge so you try to

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,080
take a small link with a big finger and

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,240
you can't even see where you think so

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,750
because cotton is for so so you know

00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,300
to conceive you talk about that as well

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,880
there's also the web apps people try to

00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,790
make web apps today like email clients

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,250
etc so that brings a whole different

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,370
challenges what we're talking about that

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,160
at the end of this presentation so let's

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,140
look at a small form factor there are

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,630
raised a really really great ideas how

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,970
to deal with it the first is assuming it

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:53,990
needs to be possible to sue my singing

00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:56,510
to look at what interest may be some

00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:59,090
good ideas president left target app to

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,770
a specific area of the page because if

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,380
you have different columns and use page

00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:07,580
at New York Times don't ever winner

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:10,880
you'll see me again example of that view

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:16,880
at New York Times adoptive a laughable

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:19,549
and those metal sooner we get this is

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,080
not perfect and there are various what

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:23,600
the patient I can't find these nice

00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,180
areas community so you're also wanted to

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,910
be able to do manually so people can

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:36,290
make a keeping see the two fingers or as

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:38,540
he desired maybe pizza wrong Penny's

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:42,170
nematology diseases two dots and the two

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,500
fingers but trying two pins out so I can

00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:49,430
see who pays will just go back and pins

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:52,940
initially bit more parties but there's

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:55,300
still a lot of issues even though sort

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,520
of the Sweden here might be at the taste

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,530
one at that colonist is pretty pretty

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,860
wide so the text become so small that is

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,680
available so actually you know there

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,410
isn't solutions for fixing us and the

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,230
royal consort in context rejoined have

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,820
any

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:16,590
same article is pretty tough it means

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,650
that it is humane Tucson me you don't

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,240
want him but the one takes here and now

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,890
in order to be able to see if you have

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,410
to shoot into this area and have to read

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,530
here scroll to the society with the next

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,510
drawback start an exam but that's pretty

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,540
annoying to end where they fix that like

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,850
beautiful the text so musical middle

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,220
Pacific Subaru you just read the out to

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,640
taste so everything this is what you

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,730
this is something that's really really

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,800
hard to get right I don't know if you

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,540
might plant or sometimes just avoid

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,790
anything that would taste as always

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,890
outside of you you try to move them into

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,440
the outer beauty because it doesn't

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,960
reform again something else is that I

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,020
said before with in the audience she be

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,300
expensive circuit is rotten tree

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,790
sparrows and there's a further issues

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,860
that we assuming get his nice animation

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,350
everything zooms in and then there's

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,850
food has changed position so maybe you

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:16,860
know what we wanted to see is not a

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:18,090
center cuz I the screen so Jonathan has

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,120
a different solution for the same

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,490
problem it's an orphan disco process

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,280
that's that you can have a setting that

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:30,150
minimal font size enforced is given one

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,370
size chemistry from smaller this jive

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,270
will bought that a bit further present

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,970
the middle one says this curve with so

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,360
when you can talk about some area

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:50,040
enforce the unit concise when you swim

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:50,990
into so a person ok well the size

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,010
of this

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:57,440
to be 10 or 12 or 12 this means that

00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,780
your risk own pace you like to see that

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,600
maybe the font size in the first column

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,660
is like this one and then in the middle

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,880
code the custom have a better widen myth

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,720
pursued in the contest Madame will be

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,880
bigger I didn't know a lot of you have

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,220
noticed that on the iphone you don't

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,200
even to see it if you know it's there

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,120
you go to not New York Times a space and

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,420
you see them sometimes it's all columns

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,450
to widen colors are they often have

00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:29,210
increased fun size a little bit it

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,310
doesn't work you know it does make sort

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,760
of organized innovation there's always

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,980
important to do text but there's a lot

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,350
different i usually there's probably

00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:46,670
more user can be small as well as to

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:49,070
solve these issues so let's get back to

00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,530
the fingers as i said before our fingers

00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,780
are pretty big so it's really really

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,820
difficult on a computer you having a

00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,540
mouse as one dot you click on a specific

00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:01,760
point on a finger this place is like a

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,430
server children you know and then you

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,500
many times you feeling shakings really

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,440
really cover i kinda put everyone shakes

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,810
a little bit when trusting us a little

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:17,810
breaks in there I remember the pace of

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:20,620
it so we need solutions for you deal

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,690
with these things like I said before

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,450
that all the spaces that one of the

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,490
problem we have in this Francis is that

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,680
you have something there and what goes

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:34,280
to next era need to be able to pad

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,110
around a speeding past but at this top

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,529
rouse you won't have big screen so you

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,169
see everything and first

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,089
later you start swallowing it but a

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,699
mobile page you are assuming some

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:47,220
specific area and want to be able to get

00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:49,889
as old you get back solutely so the dart

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,769
app is pretty good to suny into a

00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:54,899
specific area and you can do the same

00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:57,959
way that you don't have the same very in

00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,519
school not so you do able to do stella

00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:03,120
doesn't solve everything at that pace is

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,249
going to happen swimmable areas maybe

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,360
just text so i wanted to be in order to

00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:10,559
pan around fast so we may be possible to

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,199
let you compare the wrong with your

00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,720
finger that you don't add one of the

00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:18,779
iphone four still also independent and

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,910
then take an area with it in a foursome

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,519
statutes of kinetic scrolling making a

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,420
small faster so you usually get to the

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,420
cause you are see

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:37,060
also as the school estate is pretty

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:39,760
small you don't want to scroll us it's

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,430
not nice clean score able to pad it's

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,000
time for handful and also takes up space

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:48,460
on your screen so most mobile browsers

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,980
they don't show all of us instead the

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,500
useful because for indicators things

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,530
that show them self when your padding or

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,050
pinching and then disappear what you

00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,490
don't need to because when you had

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,780
interest in any way you've had a pretty

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,570
quickly and you're not reading anything

00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,070
so it's pretty good you can just look at

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,970
the sides into score while and you see

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:14,070
you good to talk about you've also made

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:17,950
other ways to show the boots about we

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:21,490
focus about the about screen or make

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:27,640
yourself only shady little bit different

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:30,280
ways to do that as I said before fingers

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,860
or he shake a little bit also will you

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,530
click so it's always a good idea now

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,450
some fresh holes like when you click

00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,280
before starting pan and easy okay you

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,590
have to move like 10 pixels before it's

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:47,290
not pretty ever to 10 people just to

00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:51,070
ignore all these dismal in precise

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,480
movements between them so this is very

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,220
common and you notice that if you take a

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,200
knife over the edge water this is

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,450
included in this way you start pinching

00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,350
using things like maybe 5 10 pixel

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,520
before start stationed at the same thing

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,620
which means that if you click on water

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,000
it doesn't start moving the page or

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:12,220
infinity story is very annoying in other

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,470
ways if I'm trying too bad i zoom into a

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:19,440
page like this one has a pen it's very

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,610
very difficult you like a movement

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,610
straight up you always

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,399
so you can try to guess or look at the

00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:34,300
various you can't believe you guys for

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,120
we wanted to hang off afterwards and

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,639
then we'll just ignore it unlock it in

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,350
that direction so you don't if you've

00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:45,250
been in art in you some useful out of it

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:47,260
and I think forms for a maggot so that

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:56,350
all these different small tricks we have

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:58,300
to apply times something else that I

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,240
said before is not on fingers when you

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,910
click on device you have a touch area so

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,699
we need to find out like a point value

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:09,639
things long this will be the time you

00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:11,500
get from oil and only you can have a

00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,320
user test you found the team's X Wall

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,800
Street I feel about that area right

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,740
about here so you take a starting point

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,990
but instead of just looking at what's

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,029
the lowest because most of the time to

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,190
make them listen because they're big

00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:30,040
fingers they won precise and you can't

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:33,459
see a thing so you use an elderly in

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,110
WebKit and if I was reading aloud wear

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:38,410
anything thing ago in this area of

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:41,019
records so what's that link just below

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,970
it so the user probably want to click on

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:50,649
that link and then we would leave enough

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:52,449
for the user another big issue have you

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,360
strong the comments are using your

00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:57,819
fingers is going to that we want it to

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,040
be like one area that is for it really

00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:02,380
confuses people if you scroll it the

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,800
sudden you in some area software in a

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,910
small there will be profuse people

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,130
because suddenly is not solid

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:14,230
differently that could be that patient

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:16,910
has framesets or asus has like I frame

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:24,860
so Prince what the iphone does sister

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:28,070
says there are no there are no 12 oh hi

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,980
friends today to expand diagrams to

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,269
their size to decide on the compass if

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,139
you would think that something that we

00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:37,790
regular pages what affects the stuff and

00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:41,949
do the same thing from frames as we also

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:45,320
do when this is a test run web contest'

00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:47,680
it shows brain sends a bit strange but

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,779
you see that we've had to some

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,329
individuals with the text you have to

00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,160
Panama Pahlavi area yeah this area you

00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:57,380
just want her to be like one day earlier

00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:02,110
in the past so you have here is to be

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:05,389
expand all saw Prince to their hottest

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:08,510
area and then sometimes you get some

00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:10,430
area not occupies will expand these are

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,060
things a bit further so we get something

00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:16,040
like this so this is offensive

00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:23,720
pre-planning enables so get one big area

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:26,300
that's called so the conclusion is that

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,430
US is a really really nice way to

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,790
interact with web / feels very natural

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:35,810
if you looking for there is one huge

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:39,829
issue but if you really feel that if the

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:43,190
pizza spot like I said before the distal

00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:45,949
browser is open up you have big this

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,260
approach you load a page there's the

00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,630
contents you overseer if you want to see

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,029
it then is not strong so long you start

00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,890
arguments already in this building but

00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,500
even if it lacks a bit you don't really

00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:00,380
notice it but on the mobile device are

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,600
slower when you're using you think as

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:07,350
you will see you

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:11,339
please help and browses the stall Alex

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,339
they do have to ignore it

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:12,280
the most common idea is to separate the

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:16,770
UI and commit and different type of

00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,770
different threats on different processes

00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,230
one way to do it is that let it rip mr.

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,170
Felmy you are possible in your process

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,600
turn on your web cross it will paint

00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,000
something it might store the painting

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,270
sequence send it to you of course you

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,820
cannot repay it this is for what I words

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,490
what they do the legwork already came

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,980
back cher ami airline it paints into

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,230
some shared memory for the web process

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:48,850
when you're ready you can show it up to

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:52,000
you I process what is really on is that

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,460
everything is not bottle so you need to

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,920
decide home use API that make sure you

00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,320
can do almost everything online because

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:04,510
of something bought everything box and

00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:07,390
you view it there's my example I've

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:10,480
written out here think about it takes us

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,980
like mixed elements so they're fixed

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,760
element it has always been in the bottom

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,200
it s is the women is painting it every

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,060
type of scrolling you have to tell the

00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,870
women are strong and you have to clearly

00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,630
back but its people okay this will have

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,730
to paint and really but we did it this

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:31,240
way with the it would be blogging the

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,520
whole time so we have to find solution

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,970
for all these small Carnegie's and I

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,970
tell you

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,920
sometimes is not the perfect solution it

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,190
breaks countenance like giant iphone

00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:47,370
haces of fixed elements princes believe

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,260
they're very few proba process of that I

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,470
have some good ideas hope you can

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,270
support on this ninety percent of fixed

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:59,880
elements for the all these different

00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:01,790
issues we have to solve and it's really

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:08,340
fun we do this while people panic

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:11,670
pitching or why would you rotate also

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,470
Lucia is a symbol to whatever or the

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:19,020
blackberry or what they're doing on the

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:20,790
iphone is using an Sakura is tied up it

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,840
means that we look at the whole town has

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:27,990
one big image like we painted across

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:31,410
into an image and it we had an image you

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:35,070
can scale but page suman image and you

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:39,000
can rotate it at 60 frames per second

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:42,240
it's like a natural number so here's an

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,110
example the green part is up screen it's

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,560
what we're looking at and agree the gray

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,620
and whoever is like the concert so the

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:55,700
content is divided into different

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:58,650
tireless some of these powers and

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,660
Colette stopped because it changed the

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,480
size of it because want to be able to

00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,840
still maybe head out and leaving penn

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:10,920
imagine one goal to be sure but it is

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:14,250
just the basic idea so when the tablet

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:17,929
comes visible when you're scrolling if

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:21,619
it's already painted by the web process

00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:24,499
we share memory or memory meth I oh well

00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:29,240
they just let it just paint that tile

00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:31,340
industry if it's not available we can do

00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,039
something the case that the content is

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,799
not ready yet Vincent I painted chatter

00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:39,409
box it's something that no more those of

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,169
the engine advocates like Photoshop

00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:46,700
their iphones you thank you so much the

00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:49,190
confidence of radiator shop in this

00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,850
meeting we have D comment the whole

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:56,149
weapon of the UI UI just paints tiles

00:19:52,850 --> 00:20:01,070
images that sometimes they obtained by

00:19:56,149 --> 00:20:04,869
the web process of course pages they

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:08,149
change their animation that powders so

00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:10,429
so when a page change my own work and

00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:13,159
tile is visible refer to update it we

00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:15,769
don't have to repaint the wall tile or

00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,570
just paint like the area we have to make

00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:21,799
sure that we paint the air for all tiles

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:23,809
mr. so that all tossed in sync you can't

00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,240
have a Princeton todd has also to do

00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:28,490
that was not dated and once in such a

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,499
few that i've updated they got them you

00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,840
might have me they were the tiles they

00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:36,470
interacted he is painted and he is not

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,240
painted like if you have a blue box easy

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,730
to do but you but you but didn't appear

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,799
here so all the tiles has always been

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:49,039
sinking when you get updated reasons to

00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:50,480
task outside the screen the common areas

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,580
to store like energy region you know

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,220
need to paint it right now you just mark

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,529
this area of tile study if you get

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,220
another dirty air from the same time you

00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:03,080
might just merge those two areas oh it's

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,789
too maybe just might just discard all

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:09,820
times

00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:13,359
who taught next time so this is not

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,369
exactly love to get to make sure or

00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,919
devices like at six frames per second

00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:19,629
for padding painting and rotation

00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,940
because we're having to repaint we have

00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:24,879
been moving can have a North why I'm

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:28,840
Adam and they can pre chaves keep

00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:31,509
executing so the basic idea is that you

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,399
just suspense on JavaScript the patio

00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:36,609
engineer rotating people character

00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:39,340
counts of this is ben javascript you

00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:41,649
just reload if there's a little girl

00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:45,820
gonna do later if you have to finish

00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:47,349
packing and they go do things because

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,879
people don't care about these things you

00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:51,220
don't notice it but it does make sure

00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:54,609
that we can really make things that take

00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:58,269
spring to say this wouldn't we would be

00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:59,979
possible to see if you did of insulin on

00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:03,249
a case I don't know how long you take to

00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:06,369
repaint red area because there might be

00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:09,489
more text you might be more rectangles

00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:13,019
and might take a bit longer so we're

00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:15,820
going to institute we do something more

00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:18,129
we don't paint anything so basically we

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,559
stall the room titles we keep the task

00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:23,320
when we asked and we just scale it just

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,989
like an image to figure this whole tile

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,059
is one big energy just scale it up I can

00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:31,659
do that 60 frames per second a problem

00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:41,320
when you finish we retain everything for

00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:43,659
this nice sharp text rotates it also be

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,539
tricky long you want to see the same

00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:49,929
thing if a little any portraits and

00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:54,009
reading languages comes in for the

00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:55,850
flooring flavoring to a monitoring it

00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:59,390
super skill so

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:01,160
area that's the basic thing look at the

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:05,150
difference between the width and the

00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:11,120
height and either x divided effective

00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:14,000
area real champion the iphone did a bit

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,549
more it may be possible for web

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,070
developers with orders to decide on but

00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:20,270
this should be made out isn't something

00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,870
that's particular very important to

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:26,179
learn other places for instance if you

00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,580
look at the new companies that make a

00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:32,500
mint as web apps it says like the

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:37,010
maximum scale is one don't do this a lot

00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:39,110
but I'm go chicken I don't want it so we

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:44,830
would be looking at multiple here rotate

00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:47,720
it that's a very missable so what we do

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,220
for all the others to whatever I for

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,150
what every one of the media disorder

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,490
many of the space haha is that we have

00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:59,299
to really up with the new human you just

00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:01,880
said O'Kane doesn't bits we relay out

00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:07,940
when it comes s it has some width of

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:10,070
Russia she there what we don't want to

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,260
do this really out why we rotate it

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,140
because then it got ensure the 60 frames

00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:21,409
a second so we have to bother Dennis

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:23,750
nemeta he rotated has just pains you

00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:26,200
check the boss from CL similar where

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:29,690
there's no brothers and when we finish

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,779
to be there so you get a smooth and

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:36,789
relation to taste animation and then

00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:39,279
it comes with everyone so something like

00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:42,960
you preach the back in storage spent the

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:50,979
jobs we paint etc keep your condoms

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:54,279
rotate and in the other countries so the

00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:56,590
school to web apps I'm not going to

00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:57,700
teach us why did you make that when you

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,440
make sense well it does make sense

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:04,479
having many non presentation about that

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,889
I think I'm slapping it on across the

00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:10,719
page later so be able to check that out

00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:13,719
but let's just in a cadet web apps make

00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:17,830
sense and ilan situations so how do we

00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:19,690
know about ponies oh did I to do with

00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,589
web apps is that there should be named

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:27,609
like new apps what does that mean Oh in

00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:29,440
music once these s peaks should be like

00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:32,320
device pixel you don't want it to be

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,599
still normal pace not know App Store

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,520
have a scale you don't want to have pain

00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,350
seem at least

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,250
all indication because none of that

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:43,020
application don't have that and you want

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,790
to be able to control that improve touch

00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:52,500
you put yourself so when you could

00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:55,440
implement a new web app back etc so

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:59,040
really so mobile browsers used to today

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,830
support touch of that which makes it

00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:06,450
possible to the paces to to do with the

00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:09,030
mints in the way to say see fit but it

00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:12,150
also means that area with yes tons of

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:14,550
that you get you have to send to web

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:18,240
process we will then have to have that

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:20,160
point annoyed if it ignored that to

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,440
affect us and then we can walk in Europe

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,080
and other things that we get this

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,470
dependency then what slow down central

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,450
good process wait for it to return this

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,790
is what we don't want so does the tricks

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:35,520
that can be applied you can change the

00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:37,680
page that you register and listener to

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:43,770
touch event if it didn't don't send any

00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:46,830
way across just do a view website for

00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,870
patrolling the layout typhoon has

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,110
finished a lot of different ideas would

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,670
you never want you different media types

00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,879
but the ledge what was introduced by the

00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:59,569
iphone which you won't be

00:26:55,879 --> 00:27:03,469
and quite common and useful most cases

00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:06,409
out there basically the I should lay out

00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:10,609
every conscience s cube web browser at

00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:13,099
the width of 900 education on androids

00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:16,969
the device may affect ahead can't decide

00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:18,709
when the one into the 918 1100 some

00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:22,369
values like that they have a few values

00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:24,979
to choose between but for instance if

00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:28,099
you can open up the apple site with not

00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:32,409
out of 18 it won't fit because that is

00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:35,029
big image of a time that is watching so

00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:38,449
there were these that page should be

00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:40,429
laid out with them a lot of you so they

00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:42,289
have this manifest to give this control

00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:45,459
to the memo to decide what to lay our

00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:48,559
countries how to do you know scaling etc

00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:51,049
so the fetus is that you can you can

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,359
divide that they are with you can able

00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:55,609
to find the height is not very used but

00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:59,629
as possible then you can define the

00:27:55,609 --> 00:28:04,219
initial the minimum and maximum scale so

00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:10,039
you soon it'll survive and as impossible

00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:12,049
to just disable enable user skating so

00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:15,889
here's a few examples this is my example

00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:18,219
shows what could be done this happen

00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:21,739
said this is defined important work

00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:26,329
presently a red light with a 320 pixels

00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:28,819
a TV i have 160 so this will be to make

00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:32,269
a face will take a perfect or an iphone

00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:33,280
so such a way to the 320 and then

00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:35,680
networks in a

00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:42,910
so you can scale anything to anything

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:45,520
else today s people are very device of

00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,770
the different resolutions etc as

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,870
possible to define that device cool so

00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:56,560
if your device is part of the names it

00:28:49,870 --> 00:29:00,210
will lay off us p for holiday to one of

00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:03,700
the big issue with Ripley's a webex

00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:06,720
instant friends that have a bottom

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,670
abutment spa or whatever you have done

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,670
how it's shown to the use of the size of

00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:14,380
the Hat like how it is taking command

00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:17,770
with your fingers that depends on the

00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,780
GPI of the device if I have high because

00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,730
it might be so small that accountability

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:26,050
it directly and then it's not what we

00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:30,400
want for a mobile app for a web app so i

00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:32,320
sent the iphone as a TTI 160 so in this

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,250
proper start to rise especially with

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,680
android phones coming outwards DDI of

00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:41,620
214 people start to figure closer to you

00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,900
solve this issue so who would they make

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:47,170
a definition of something called a

00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:51,310
density pixel and that defines the

00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:55,930
people on a 160 DPI follow tennis

00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:59,110
because almost it was all web app today

00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:02,140
and sample data for the noise and now

00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:04,570
that that was at the other and the case

00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:09,640
it does exactly the same this is how

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:15,530
things work so if you look at 25 / to

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:19,400
the 8900 on the android devices

00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:21,500
beyond the active scale of the cotton so

00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,370
if you had a 320 from the paint

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:30,680
invective scaling up by one but 5 204

00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:32,990
about 160 this is not what you've always

00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:36,550
wanted us all about is really nice

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:40,010
devices beautiful screen nice DPI

00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:43,250
license plate off so ever and heavens

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:47,090
subject or topic density DPI as possible

00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:48,980
to overload find all the safety I think

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:51,770
it's gone we need to determine what

00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:56,600
about 60 points possible centrist device

00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:58,700
t guy and then via CSS figure out and

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,650
skillman I think a lot of different CSS

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:08,110
far better resolution images publicist

00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:10,580
with federal solutions so summing up

00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:12,950
making the mobile browser touch devices

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,950
has a lot of different violence than

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:19,250
taking it this compressor our focus is

00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:22,850
on the transom traction on seeing your

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:24,560
content and interacting with it so when

00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,690
you talk to then do believe this agent

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,270
application separation and a lot of

00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:32,660
small space to make everything work but

00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:34,850
I've just shown in fewer than today but

00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:39,290
there's a lot more a lot about these you

00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:42,020
may disagree work and between web apps

00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:44,180
the application reason support anyway

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,220
Bob to decide whether prostitute

00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:50,630
supports feeling maybe whether it should

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:53,450

singing putting pencil padding and

00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:26,000
rotating an image and there's something

00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,339
you have to be careful about the texture

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,450
of use

00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:32,849

bit ball Cain yes love you the way this

00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:10,200
can be done like I said use a shared

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,980
memory and implement it the way you want

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,900
it just baby the endless intimidation

00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,900
can vary depending on

00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:59,119
exit etiquette how the holy people use a

00:35:53,010 --> 00:36:02,369
spontaneous and lost everything allow me

fishnet always paint to talk outside

00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:08,940
visible area it had anticipated when the

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,059
radiant so is a schedule and they are

00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,069
seing faintest out entirely but still

00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:16,109
painting autopsies to recommend me to

00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:20,130
swing as well so it's all happen trade

00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:22,619
on something that is performance that's

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,780
part of my existence but it gives the

00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:26,369
best user experience of course at the

00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,069
unis that you should be disowned the

00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:31,319
American device and you should try to

00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:33,210
make it possible to make the quest

00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:36,299
almost impossible to see that the

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,299
chamber database so that you don't want

00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:40,410
