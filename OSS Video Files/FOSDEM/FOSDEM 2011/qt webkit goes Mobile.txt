Publication date: 2011-12-22

Description: 
	by Kenneth Christiansen

WebKit is everywhere, on desktops, mobiles, - and as an integrated part of the Qt platform, it is on Linux-based MeeGo as well.

n this session we will quickly introduce the WebKit project, and look at why it has become so popular on the mobile platform. We will look at some of the mobile adaptions normally done by the different WebKit ports and at the work we have been doing in Qt WebKit to make it more fit for mobile usage.

Some of the technologies we will touch, includes: frame flattening, tiling (including challenges), viewport meta information, touch events and fuzzy hit testing.

We hope the session will make people aware of the importance of the Qt WebKit project and its mobile efforts; create discussions and use-cases that we can use for integrating even better with, in particular, open source projects targeting mobile usage and the open source community in general.
