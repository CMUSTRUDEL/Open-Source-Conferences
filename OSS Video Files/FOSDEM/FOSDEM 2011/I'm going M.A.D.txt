When people talk about monitoring generally they are system people talking of hosts and network gear going up and down. That is the monitoring world as most people know it and it must change if we want to write better applications and offer better services.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org
