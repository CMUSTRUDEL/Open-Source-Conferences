Title: linux disaster recovery with rear
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	by Gratien D'haese 

Disasters do happen, big or small, so we better be prepared before these happen.

Commercial Operating Systems ship tools to help you prepare or create images for several years already. However, Linux still lacks a good standard tool delivered with the core system tools (besides tar) to assist with creating a disaster recovery images. As you can image a disaster recovery (DR) exercise is more then just restoring a plain backup.

In the first part of the presentation we will guide you through the different steps in creating a Linux Disaster Recovery Procedure with Relax and Recover (rear).

Rear is a modular disaster recovery engine completely written in bash and released under GPL v2 license. Rear can store the details about your systems on hard disks (network, USB, SAN,...) or network (PXE, NFS, CIFS,...) including the complete backup. It also creates a bootable image which you need to recreate your system from scratch. Furthermore, thanks to the modular concept, we can integrate rear with foreign backup solutions (commercial or not) to do the backup and restore part which makes rear very scalable in big enterprises.

In the second part of the presentation we will explain how to build a Linux Disaster Recovery as a Service with rear-server.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

welcome in this afternoon's session my

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:18,930
talk will be over a Linux disaster

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,869
recovery as a service so welcome my name

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,609
is Carson death and one of the

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:27,720
maintainer of the relax in the recover

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:30,810
program but this talk will begin with an

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,620
broad perspective talking about disaster

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,750
recovery and history planning etc but

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,850
let's start with it

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,680
oh okay the agenda

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,710
so the question sometimes is do

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,530
disasters to really happen now will soon

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,350
you know why we will talk about planning

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,039
about the sort that is available on the

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,379
market how to do it in practice how to

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,930
exercise it then I will discuss in

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,359
particular the open source project to

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,979
relax and recover that's one of the open

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,760
source projects that are related to

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:12,210
disaster recovery and as last topic I

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,520
want to spend some time describing what

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:19,799
and disaster recovery as a service could

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,659
mean how to build it up from ground ok

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,049
the question is do disasters really

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:28,070
happen these are pictures from disasters

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,380
that are only less than one year old and

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,990
fire can happen this year we had a lot

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,540
of snowfall roofs collapsed so this is

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,780
in picture from from Belgium somewhere

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,360
you gotta have a flute water break its

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,250
computer rooms can go underwater state

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,920
etcetera earthquakes is maybe less

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,590
important in Belgium but you never know

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,439
of course but seriously the most

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,740
critical disaster that can happiness and

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,110
burn out of your computer

00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:01,409
parties that fails you could protect by

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,649
a good fan the silly pics but ok to

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,049
bring some soil in the talk so to give

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,420
you some small basics if we talk about

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,099
disaster recovery and the disaster

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,040
recovery is effect a small piece of

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:17,409
and complete disaster and that disaster

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,780
Coffee is about how to restore a

00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,819
function for example a computer to an

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,269
ready state again so it is working as

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:27,549
before in contrary you have also

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:30,159
business community that's the process

00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:31,780
the process of the business how will the

00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,599
business react and the disaster happens

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,519
until that business is restored as usual

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,549
as normally so there's complete

00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:43,090
different broad spectrum about disaster

00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:45,220
recovery restoration in fact in this

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,430
talk I will concentrate on the first

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:52,389
part disaster recovery of computer data

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,099
centers etc albeit the second part would

00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:58,060
be a very interesting talk but that will

00:02:54,099 --> 00:03:01,319
be for another time I believe so

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,799
disaster recovery the question is always

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,840
will it happen

00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,609
yes of course probably most of the

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,400
people here in the room already had to

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:11,500
deserve more or less computer breaks you

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,849
lose your computer for example you lose

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,949
important data these things happen

00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:21,609
unfortunately we are not always prepared

00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:25,780
so the important lesson if you go out

00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:28,419
here is be prepared and react primarily

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,790
on disaster so before you can react

00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:34,569
timely you need a plan that's very

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:36,549
important so don't hesitate if you have

00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:42,519
a disaster you have to know what to do

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:44,739
immediately so I got often the question

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,590
I have a good backup server good backup

00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,359
policy excellent you have to have that

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,750
because it's very important to restore

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:55,569
data but in case of a disaster backups

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,220
are not always enough because you can

00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,919
restore your data of course that if you

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,169
do lose your computer computer you have

00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,569
to restore your computer new heart is

00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:07,269
for example you have to reload you OS

00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:10,689
you have to find unit we install your

00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:13,209
backup software that takes a lot of time

00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,069
and in case of disaster you don't have

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,459
that much of a time because you can lose

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:20,739
so much time days sometimes weeks if you

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,270
had it's very long time ago that even

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:26,050
after months a lot of tweaks came up

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,030
because they were from

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,270
disaster because nobody know how that

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,849
was configured in after months anymore

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:37,030
so it's very important to foresee these

00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:39,340
kind of things and it can help you to

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,409
even kind of inventory of your hardware

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,720
and software it's very important to have

00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:47,310
it there's software available I will

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:51,370
speak about it a bit later so the plan

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:54,580
disaster recovery plan I will stress the

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,349
word plan it's very important before the

00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,810
disaster you can act on the disaster you

00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:00,849
need to plan everything you have to find

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,690
the money you have to convince your

00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:06,819
managers of a decent plan you have to

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,030
exercise plan so you need to have extra

00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:13,270
Hardware available or you hire it that

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,030
it depends on the amount of value you

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,969
get from the managers and that will

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,620
guarantee that you if you exercise it

00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,509
that you know what to do that you can

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:27,400
act immediately that's very important

00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:30,699
and the last line that's very low you

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,150
can see it is the less managers around

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:36,039
you in case of disaster the better

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,770
because they always tend to influence

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,139
you to rent in your way it's very

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,289
important decision makers get them out

00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:48,520
and with a decent plan that's the way to

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:50,380
do it very important so what are the

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,380
main steps in a disaster recovery plan

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:57,069
well the risk analysis before you can

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,050
act on plan you have to know what can

00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:01,120
happen and what are the factors in my

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,639
computer room which are important

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,479
because not all the operating systems

00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,370
not all the data not all the computers

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:11,590
at sets of functions of computers are

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,050
equally important so you have to make

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,139
some categories which computers should

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,940
be restored immediately like for example

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,300
and database server is most of the times

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:24,370
one of the important things to restore

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,279
immediately manual disaster happens of

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:31,449
you exercise a disaster it's very

00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:34,240
important you have to develop an and

00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,919
plan of course you have to time it you

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,190
have to write it down you have to make

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,590
an inventory and therefore you have to

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,210
go around in your computer room you have

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,280
to know the labeling the operators have

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,720
to be trained as stuff like that so

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,210
there are a lot of checklists to be made

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,639
and a lot of meetings to be done with a

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,310
lot of people that the important point

00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,990
is you have to convince your managers

00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,900
your directors your board of directors

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:02,050
that you need a budget and enlarge

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,909
budget hopefully to give you the time to

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,009
exercise everything because it takes a

00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:07,870
lot of time to make an decent

00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:10,750
defensively and to test it stuff like

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,880
that and very important also the last

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,130
line here you have to test the disaster

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,930
recovery plan plan because once you made

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,650
it it's not enough because your computer

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,930
room is continuously alive and changing

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:26,740
so there are new computers going out all

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:28,960
the others going out and new things is

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,539
coming so you have to redo the exercise

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,449
or the thinking about the planning at

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:37,180
least at the yearly basis also the

00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:39,159
testing very important to do it not all

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,979
the computers but one in a time for

00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:45,699
example you could categorize it and just

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:49,020
test it of course it's always better to

00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:52,270
prepare a disaster to avoid a defect

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,849
keep it simple I stupid some simple

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,440
things is having good mirroring and good

00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,870
backup of course

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,870
test your restores of backups very

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,699
important and to make an eventually this

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,710
in the open source world a very good

00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:09,759
program available it's called it's

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,889
called configure to HTML that makes and

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,479
kind of hardware inventory of your

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:17,139
system that also on software inventory

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:20,490
and keeps a listing of all your country

00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:23,770
races affect and you can put it aside

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:26,529
and of course when you are ready to

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,360
start with with that you have to find a

00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:30,909
good decent program to do the bare metal

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,399
restores they are quite a bit available

00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:37,060
I gave you as some overview of of what

00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,750
is available now the first choice is do

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:43,029
we go for commercial or open source

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,829
yeah I know here we are all convinced

00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:48,310
that open source is the way to go we do

00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:50,910
and luckily there are a lot of big

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:55,440
companies huge companies that are

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:57,930
realizing that open source is not bad I

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,520
remember 20 years ago it wasn't disaster

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,860
to convince the managers that open

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,380
source was better than closed source but

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,260
the mindset is changing in a good way

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,810
that open source does get the chance

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,450
also in the disaster coffee environments

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,220
that's a good point but anyway whatever

00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,320
you choose if it's commercial open

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,020
source you have to test it but because

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,120
not every program does fit your needs or

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,610
you maybe you don't like it anyway so

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,380
the testing is very important never test

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:30,150
on item on production server of course

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,890
office and test server so what are the

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,700
solutions available in the open source

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:38,760
world commercial I don't talk about you

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,670
have a lot of categories and open source

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,440
world you have disaster recovery modules

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,770
that are available in for example and

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,990
backup solution to name one is bacala

00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,700
it's an open source backup solutions

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,330
very good open source backup solution

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:57,870
but I'm not too fond of having a

00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:00,810
disaster recovery module that you get as

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,150
an extra thing within backup because the

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,400
main focus is on backup and you can only

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,870
be good at one point backup or disaster

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,640
coffee so you are very linked to back

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,120
rights of and that's not always the best

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,600
opportunity but ok if you like it fine

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,090
another possibility is the cloning

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,830
cloning is nice to make new systems but

00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,680
it's not the right way to do a disaster

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:28,380
coffee because it's a snapshot it's

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,360
almost old and it doesn't give you the

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,030
flexibility that you need sometimes on

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,740
you a little bit different hardware

00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,230
that's the problem with cloning system

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,070
it's not always hung presenta light and

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,980
then it doesn't work

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,900
I had it all ready a few times but it's

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,150
ok it's good for one purpose but not for

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,320
disaster recovery in my opinion but ok

00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,440
you don't have to believe me of course

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,740
test it yourself and then you have the

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:57,150
true open source disaster recovery

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,780
software their main focus is on disaster

00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,530
recovery

00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:03,840
luckily and not on backup but ok you can

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,970
do backups with it but it's not

00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,980
a backup solution it's a disaster

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:12,330
recovery solution that gives you also

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:16,230
backups but again and their main focus

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:18,240
is to give you a very quick environment

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,830
user interface not a very fancy user

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,080
face that's not important when you're in

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:25,350
disaster recovery mode you have only a

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,200
laptop or a small term low sometimes

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,540
only a prompt so what the heck are you

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,120
give a fancy user interface in that

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,250
moment you need command lines you need

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,970
to type something very fast and it has

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:42,270
to act immediately okay in this category

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,070
we have three open-source disaster

00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:47,040
recovery software available in the

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:51,840
market we have mounted rescue that's

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:54,120
about from 2000 we have MK CD rack makes

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,510
it ROM recovery and we have relax and

00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,090
recover

00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:02,430
I can only say something about NPC

00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:05,340
direct because I wrote it also so it's

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:08,460
also my piece of software which is the

00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:11,790
predecessor of relaxer recover it's a

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,790
wonderful wonderful program that is so

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,880
monolithic it's not flexible enough to

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:20,390
react and change and you need change

00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,030
also in disaster recovery models

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:26,160
therefore we rewrote effect and KC drag

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,650
in a new program relaxed and recovering

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,710
so encased the wreck is still existing

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,270
and the user base is still very good try

00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,740
to convince people to go to real exit

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,730
recover but sometimes difficult because

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,430
they like it so much

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:41,130
ok now you have known the rescue that's

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:44,600
also a good program but ok I won't talk

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:49,080
about it because I never use it not so

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:52,200
okay in disaster recovery the medium or

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,120
the data is very important never store

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,970
your data of your disaster recovery on

00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:01,770
your local computer always use external

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:04,830
data storage very important whatever the

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:08,300
bootable medium is is not that important

00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:11,760
you have to boot your your new system

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,390
the iron.i either in its CD or whatever

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,890
or fear the network Pixability

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,020
via USB

00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,000
via and Dave with one button disaster

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,980
recovery everything is possible

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,900
and you can mix the two things you

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,790
haven't boot medium and you have your

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,760
data store it's where your backups are

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:32,010
restored earliest Whorton it can be on

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,930
the same media it can be different you

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:37,800
can have no land only solution that you

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:39,920
boot from an and central boot server

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,630
pixie server and that in fact your

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,880
archival or your data stories is effect

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,790
on an ester over on the different system

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,800
perfectly pops possible all in a

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,810
different environment when you don't

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,940
have a fast and fancy Ness server you

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,590
can have in the on the tape an external

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,720
tape drive you can boot from the tape

00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,600
you can have it on the USB disk these

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,190
days the USB can be in total solution

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,140
you can boot from the USB and we have

00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,990
the data also on it because in USB you

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:10,170
can remove and store it in and then fall

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:12,510
somewhere whatever there are different

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,950
solutions even tar of our sink as

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,770
possible you can do it of the network

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:19,830
for example and firewall you don't have

00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:22,200
a lot of rules you know only need the

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,470
secure cell or sync rule effect to go

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,650
through your internal data center it's

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:32,340
all possible but you have to configure

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:36,330
it of course helped us disaster recovery

00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:39,180
work in practice first of all you have

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,880
to get the system information so the

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,100
program that you use will collect all

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:48,090
your data network information boot

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,800
information your disk information all

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,810
kinds of information as to be gathered

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,810
it has to be stored on central place

00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:01,620
also the the disk layout LVM red stuff

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:05,550
if you're using grip little ila or I lie

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,230
low for attain iam based systems you

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:11,010
have to make a system backup from that

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:13,980
particular time and also to user data

00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:17,460
but not necessarily and you have to make

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,930
a bootable image effect and because in

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,700
the case of disaster recovery

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,820
you have to boot from that image that

00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:27,960
you created that image can be stored on

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:30,320
CD on a network tape USB whatever and

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,870
all these steps are done online

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,270
that's a very nice thing of it so you

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:38,450
can have an production server you can

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:41,720
just Lance it via crown or an another

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:45,560
queueing system daily weekly whatever

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,760
and you have it online available that is

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,470
the practice for making the rescue image

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,530
now if you are in a disaster recovery

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:58,070
mode you need that rescue image to boot

00:15:54,530 --> 00:16:00,800
from so you boot your system and you

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,780
have a toolbox out there and here are

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,420
describing that for the rescue units you

00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,760
need also the the Linus kernels and the

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,730
device drivers the network configuration

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:15,830
stuff like that okay and it's all done

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:18,680
in RAM so the in it RT environment now I

00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,870
come to the recovery phase in the

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,840
recovery phase you need to boot from the

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:26,660
rescue image you have to restore your

00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,480
disk layout first of all you have to

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,480
recreate your partitions the file

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,060
systems that were originally created you

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,070
have to mount it and then once mounted

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,190
you have to restore the data from your

00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:42,170
data store whatever it was when that is

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,100
down you restore the boot loads and

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,960
effect that's it

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,180
once the boot loaders are there you can

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,640
do a manual inspection inspection or not

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,340
depends and you can just reboot your

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,900
system and that's finished let's affect

00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,200
the the simple steps in disaster

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,360
recovery making an image and then

00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,760
restoring the image back on the new

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,100
hardware or a new virtual partition

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,640
doesn't matter and just build it and

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,640
that's it work

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,600
let's talk a little bit about to the

00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:16,140
election recover relaxant recovery was

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,120
created in 2006 together with my

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,439
colleague and some German colleague

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:25,589
slow-motion Pierrot he was a very fan of

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,169
MK city rec and we decided together to

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,330
write it from scratch he also has some

00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:34,169
open source projects and together we

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:36,870
rewrote it in fact in two months time

00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:39,360
also we have the first release available

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:41,040
so it was an incredible solution and the

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,440
way it was because it was completely

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,870
written in a modular way but I come back

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,190
to that later

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:50,340
relaxed recovery has come from far away

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:54,270
from 2006 where we have no usage effect

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:57,500
until now that we have a very broad user

00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:01,679
environment going from big companies

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:06,740
even in Belgium don't know if you ruin

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:09,150
and are available I see a sec ok because

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,669
you can say that the Federal Police is

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,110
going to open source way and I use real

00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:16,919
action recovery for the deserves to be

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:19,650
coffee feature so thank you Federal

00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:22,020
Police but not only develop releases

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:25,020
using it the German government a lot of

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,720
German governments are using it and also

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,000
quite a lot of commercial companies even

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,120
very big ones that are using for the

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,090
global disaster recovery policy and

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,919
important is it's available since

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:41,640
beginning last year in fedora so you can

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:47,250
just do yum install rear and also it is

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:51,270
shipping with less 11 SB 2sp3 it is in

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:53,040
the image over there and it integrates

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,370
which is very important we find that

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,380
very important as a modular system you

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,809
can integrate very easily external

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,110
backup software so there are already a

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:06,150
few external backup software linked into

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:09,780
rear so that your backup is effect

00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:12,419
stored with for example Tivoli or data

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,720
protector of net backup bacala is also

00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:17,309
available so you don't care about rear

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,170
way if you back up it's done by the

00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:21,450
really good

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,220
software that you trust because the

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,470
companies that trust their backup

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,540
software because they the operators are

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,320
trained for it so it's a very good

00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,080
selling point

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,120
that's your disaster recovery system

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:37,440
integrates very well if your existing

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,170
backup software but of course we are in

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,990
an open source environment and we first

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:46,260
of all we delivered Muhtar as the main

00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,270
default backup solution our sink is

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,720
another possibility and now we have

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:55,950
since the new release 1.9 bacala also as

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:59,250
an open source solution and it scales

00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,350
very well that already told you that ok

00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,540
a bit of history it's just - authority

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,940
at this effect the spin-off of - open

00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,400
source projects and it was released and

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:13,050
was he even in three weeks time not one

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,720
month or two months ok what are the

00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:18,780
features relax the recover are we're

00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,200
with I will masonry R in the future is

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:24,690
focused on disaster coffee only backup

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,790
is not backup is important but not the

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,710
main focus so we are not really

00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:34,680
interested in doing in let's say

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:37,640
incremental backups we try to do an

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:41,730
complete full backup as the main

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:45,420
integration so its effect a simple full

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,620
backup integration it complements also

00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,170
the backup sort of software of course

00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,800
because backup is very good in

00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:55,580
incrementals and gave you a long time

00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:58,080
data storage but backup software is not

00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:01,590
really intended to do disaster recovery

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:05,280
so the two software pieces that fit

00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:08,190
together very well and that in fact fact

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,890
is what we try to propose or what is our

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,130
methodology say use the best tool for

00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,130
the job

00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:21,059
so I already message that that external

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:25,190
backup software or commercial backup

00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:28,380
software is supported and included today

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:30,029
even last week we had a new release 1.9

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,940
we are very excited with it because

00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:35,639
there are a lot of bug fixes solved and

00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,750
also very a lot of new features were

00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:41,490
added but I will talk about a bit later

00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,679
so the integration is very transparent

00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,529
and other backup solutions are still

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,360
available and still are missing but for

00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:50,880
commercial backup solutions we are

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,880
working with an sponsoring model so we

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:59,250
don't write it just for the fund we can

00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,710
add it if you'd like to pay for it and

00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,169
very important in my opinion that rear

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:07,350
is integrating very well in the network

00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:09,419
so you can have a complete Network only

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:13,830
solution you don't have to fiddle with

00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:16,620
tapes or CDs or other external hardware

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:19,950
you can do it but you don't have to do

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,070
it and that's the fundamental important

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,139
point if you want to make an service

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:28,320
around it you have to make a service you

00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:30,630
need include network not everyone has a

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,490
good network but ok for the epic

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,539
companies who can afford it they do have

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:38,340
it a good network also means a good San

00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:40,620
solution so that an S or sin is

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,480
available so you can never have a very

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,230
quick storage or retrieval from your

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:50,070
store it's from your environment what is

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:51,840
also important that the companies if we

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,190
deliver the this software it's open

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,480
source of course that they can make

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:59,220
their own branded rpms or packages for

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,769
them beyond but doesn't matter so they

00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,350
can tweak it a little bit and they can

00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:05,460
repackage it and just distribute it to

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,870
all their computers

00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:11,909
I think that's an advantage and the

00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:15,450
scheduling of course that's done by

00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:18,529
their scheduling team or whatever so the

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:21,630
development of rear is an open-source

00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:24,600
based model and we're using source force

00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,370
to store our data and you can use

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,020
subversion to

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,390
get the snapshots available but the

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,990
snapshot oral also available on the

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,059
Internet

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,929
you can have in daily update of our

00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:39,809
builds and development is done based on

00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:42,779
sponsoring or also done by the community

00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:45,240
we have some already told you have two

00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:48,990
main developers that are quite some

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,549
active developers in the community two

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,330
guys from fed the police for example

00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:57,450
they are very active the last months and

00:23:53,330 --> 00:24:01,260
working very close to us with us to make

00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:03,809
new features available but I'm very

00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,309
grateful and that's the the strong point

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,620
of open source it is you have a

00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:09,600
community and community you can feedback

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,970
you get feedback from the community and

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,620
it gets very good ideas and together

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:17,520
with it you can have a discussion and

00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:19,470
you can work to a good solution because

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,480
sometimes we get patches and we are very

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:25,620
grateful that we get patches that

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,450
sometimes very weak and then we have the

00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,730
community and we can improve the patches

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:32,029
very quickly and that is very nice I

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:34,740
like it very much that framework

00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:38,159
why is that framework so important

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,710
because rear was built with in the back

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,230
of our heads we knew about the faults we

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,600
made with MKC dreck it was very

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,149
monolithic was very strong program and

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,360
still very strong someone a lady that

00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:53,640
only I were even affected to a very good

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,179
goal design called development called

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,190
patching that's not very good module

00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,169
effect the model that we'd now have is a

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,600
framework and you can just plug in

00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:05,789
modules and it's a very easy module

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,669
because it's written in bass we don't

00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:10,559
have C coding not yet so far it's just a

00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:13,770
bad script very small sometimes only ten

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,590
lines long that do a job so it's easy to

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:18,200
debug and you can just plug it in

00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:21,059
explain it a bit later

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,760
drop me places online adjust the release

00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:27,149
1.9 or freer and also the release notes

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,460
and the presentation will also be on our

00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:32,010
website so you can then download it from

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,520
the presentation section I will do it

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,520
this evening

00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:43,220
okay so the architecture of fear

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:45,920
I explained it's a modular way so if you

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,350
do and command rear dump you will get an

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,920
overview like on the left side of the

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:54,470
pictures of course that gives you what

00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,130
architecture are you running on what is

00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:01,250
the OS vendor vendor which version of

00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:04,820
the vendor you're using and you have a

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:08,500
configuration tree on the left side you

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:12,980
see the conflicts which are available

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:15,919
most of the conflicts are a bit made by

00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,510
us and best practice that there are two

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,669
configuration files that are very

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,710
interesting for you it's called the

00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:23,360
cited Gulf and the local doctrine the

00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:27,200
site of topography effect is there you

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,580
can put some variables for your site for

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,290
example for your company that's not

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,900
important if you are working to the same

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:35,390
Pyxis server you can define define it

00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,309
over there for your local computer you

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:41,290
can just use the local port conf and

00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:47,179
these are stored in the / ETCs less rear

00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:50,450
directory so how do you use it all the

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:52,910
scripts are stored under the user share

00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:56,630
rear subdirectories there are you fine

00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:59,960
to complete directory structure and we

00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:02,570
have a list of methods and methods to

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,630
make and rescue image and method to

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,690
restore it so it's the same data your

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:11,059
real executables well scripts are also

00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:13,040
on the rescue image and also the

00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:14,750
configuration files so each conference

00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,669
file that you modify on a local computer

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,400
is also on the rescue image

00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:22,790
so it's copied effect so you have the

00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:27,890
exact same definitions and the exact

00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:30,679
same programs available and you can make

00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,720
a make backup or make backup only it's

00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,480
available and the recover important if

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,940
you want to restore and also you can

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,419
plug in models like a cell for example

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:44,270
the config to HTML is already available

00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:46,730
not as a model but if you install for

00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,480
example config to HTML you can just

00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,130
enable it in real

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,220
Livan variable and then it will

00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:55,620
automatically detect it and run it and

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:59,280
store the output of config to HTML in

00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:07,290
the subdirectories of far less Favre's

00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:09,540
let's let rear effect okay already

00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:12,179
explained to the site and the local

00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:15,360
conference files you can see some

00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:19,740
examples an example output output could

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:22,520
be an eyesore could be a tape could be

00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,650
one better disaster recovery for example

00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:30,120
you have also backup definitions meta

00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:32,480
fess meta fesses for example going using

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:36,750
a fan a server NFS service safe server

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,000
also USB is a net FS solution and we

00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,010
tend to use a lot of the net effects

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,809
solution and the net effect goes

00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,880
together with the net effects you are L

00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:46,410
and there are some other options if you

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,690
need for example user password

00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:51,750
credentials you can have some options

00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:53,940
over there these options you don't have

00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:57,090
to know it by heart of course it's all

00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,320
described in a concept guide you can

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,710
find it on the website

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,690
and we also have a new file in the

00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,270
documentation directory or subdirectory

00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,760
it gives you an overview of the possible

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,230
configurations that you can have to

00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,450
start with because I know it's a bit

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,220
confusing and begin but that the fact

00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:19,410
it's very easy once you understand how

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:21,570
it works it's very simple there's a

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,970
simple now output of the rear come out

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,580
if you don't type any option it will

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:29,270
give you some help and a list of

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,220
commands which are available to type

00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:34,679
always handy to start with is the don't

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,750
come out as you saw in few slides before

00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:40,260
that gives you an overview of which is

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:42,179
your current or s and then the second

00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,700
option that you can start with is make

00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:46,410
rescue of course that makes and rescue

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,450
image without backup

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,610
if you said just make rescue it makes

00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:53,220
and disaster recovery image you can boot

00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:55,770
from it so it's handy you need to test

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,290
it you need to know if my image boots on

00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:00,840
my system or run another system so

00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:04,590
before you do a make backup and recover

00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:07,190
but again don't worry there are a few

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:10,259
papers all already on the internet that

00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:15,509
explaining the commands and how to use

00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:17,159
it in different scenarios the backup or

00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:19,559
rescue method huh

00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,240
that's almost the same there is only one

00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:23,580
difference then make backup makes it all

00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,980
sewn back up and the rescues not for the

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:29,100
rest is exactly the same it has some

00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:32,279
phases the phases I already discussed a

00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:35,039
bit in the disaster recovery analyzing

00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:38,730
you have a preparation phase you analyze

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,669
your system and it's all stored under

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,350
develop real recovery subtopic 3 so

00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:45,899
there you find your data on your local

00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:48,539
system that directory is also copied on

00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:51,179
the recipe image so you can always look

00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:54,210
at your local system to see what the

00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:57,299
latest statuses of your configuration

00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:00,869
files I know there's different phases

00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:03,389
it's not that import that I explain it

00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:05,309
but you can find that in the constant

00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:11,639
guide and more detailed explanation of

00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:13,889
it an example if you use the flag - s

00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:14,820
it's a simulation that's very

00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:17,519
interesting

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,980
it gives you an overview of all little

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,399
subscripts which are included in a

00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,379
certain method or phase but it's not

00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,539
readable but ok if you install it and

00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:29,999
just try it once it doesn't harm

00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:33,029
anything it does doesn't do anything at

00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:35,999
all it just so you which commands or

00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:38,490
which commands methods effect and which

00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:41,249
scripts will be executed in which order

00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:45,450
the order is also very important so from

00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:47,820
the left to the right and you have a log

00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:51,450
file the law file is stored on the

00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:56,269
Celestion P it's called rear- host name

00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:59,100
dot law very interesting to look at

00:31:56,269 --> 00:32:01,019
not much output is given but it's very

00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:05,190
good if you have errors you will see

00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:07,289
them there the recovery phase is well

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,809
it's the opposite you have to recover

00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:12,360
your system these are the steps that you

00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:13,809
are required is the verification it will

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,539
verify if your

00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:19,629
rescue image is capable of doing a

00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:22,450
recovery if you only didn't make make

00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:27,549
rescue and don't have backup and the

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:31,479
method says for example bacala but you

00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:32,979
didn't define any Pecola environment of

00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:38,919
course not it can be restored and it

00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:42,279
will complain about it ok very important

00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:46,210
to know this if you decide a method to

00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:47,950
use for example backup and an output the

00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:52,659
recovery phase will use exactly the same

00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:54,879
one as I explained that the make rescue

00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:56,919
make backup and the recover are using

00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:59,619
the same set of compressed files so

00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:02,739
don't expect to do something else it's

00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:06,729
important to know if you have to foresee

00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:09,009
it nothing is impossible but that's part

00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:12,700
of the planning also here you can do an

00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:15,279
- s you see that here it is a very small

00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,869
output because it was a request restore

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,909
that is a very simple method that will

00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:23,739
just do its job and then wait and tell

00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:27,489
you I'm ready for the restoration and

00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:29,289
then you have to do an other kind of

00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:32,349
thing to restore your data for example

00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:33,849
in our sink or something else and then

00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:36,399
it waits for you and when you're done

00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:38,200
you just click return and it does it the

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,039
rest of its off the making bootloader

00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:44,080
active for example that's a very stupid

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,359
way of doing disaster recovery but it is

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,999
available in some cases it could be

00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:54,999
interesting already explained the config

00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:57,609
to HTML cannot stress enough it's quite

00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:59,830
important if you activate it you will

00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:03,039
see a line coming up the red line over

00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:06,729
there and you will have some extra lines

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,279
or text files available under the sub

00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:13,629
directive our lip relatively config to

00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:16,059
HTML very handy in case of disaster what

00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:18,309
hardware data at what operating systems

00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:19,659
were operating system which

00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:23,279
configuration files are available

00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:23,279
however the settings etc etcetera

00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:31,280
again the log file that's an example

00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:34,970
what is the status the status already

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:38,990
explained that is very mature on Intel

00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:42,320
and 46 based architecture it's also

00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:45,290
working on Italian and PowerPC but it's

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,720
less tested so it is working but well

00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:50,060
the more uses we'll using it more

00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,149
feedback we we will get of course it is

00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:57,970
released as an RPM tar in depth and it's

00:34:53,149 --> 00:35:00,800
it's with Suzy Suzy in fedora and well

00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,660
support is available via source ports

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,320
and we are open for batch of machines of

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:08,780
course the more the better the current

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,940
development already mentioned 1.9 has

00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,340
just been released and it is the basic

00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,920
steps for starting with cloning it's

00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,170
still in beta it does work but you

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,740
cannot rely on percent on it because we

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:24,320
still need to tune things so in the next

00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:27,020
release it will be much better but that

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,750
is already useful for migration from

00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,359
physical to virtual vice versa whatever

00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,160
and that worked quite well the one

00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:36,859
button disaster recovery method is

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,710
available and don't think much people

00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:43,160
using it still but ok it's there and

00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:45,859
what my point is the DHCP client is

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:50,320
available and you need that

00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:53,920
infrastructure for having an server

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,510
service afterwards so the network again

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,820
and there's a toolkit available for

00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:01,820
doing other stuff than just recovery but

00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:05,390
to do some inspection of your system

00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:09,050
what is still missing is a central point

00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:10,670
of storage but I already had we had a

00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:12,920
center point of stories of your data

00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,350
find a server what I still missing is a

00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,140
central point of your rescue images for

00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:20,510
example or your conference of files

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:22,910
because it's you do it locally you put

00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,410
it on the USB or on the tape or CD and

00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,990
you over your copies manually to a

00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:29,660
central point this kind of things could

00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:32,119
be automated and that is effect what you

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,950
we are working now as a future step is

00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,859
called disaster recovery as a service

00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:39,109
collect also the rescue images conferees

00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:40,640
to a central point so that we get a

00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:43,339
service around it

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:49,670
and that point software we will call Rio

00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:50,989
server so in the first phase effect we

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,619
are collecting the information and

00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:57,489
making an web-based interface around it

00:36:54,619 --> 00:37:00,739
so that you can just make a listing of

00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:02,269
service that you did in disaster coffee

00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:04,309
did it work

00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:05,930
what were the failures you can look at

00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:07,730
the log files for example you can

00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:10,160
restart it these kind of actions should

00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:12,980
be possible in the first phase you can

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,730
group it by Department by host OS stuff

00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:19,660
like that that will be the the planning

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:23,289
for the coming months and the plans are

00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:28,039
now after six months predicting in

00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:29,809
getting very real so you may expect that

00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:34,700
within six months the first release of

00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:37,700
free server will be released what are

00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:40,220
the requirements it should go for

00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:43,160
example to a firewall all the boundaries

00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,930
network boundaries should be protocol

00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,079
independent so we don't want to have

00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:50,660
fancy protocols used we only want to use

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,849
the standard available protocols on the

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,130
systems so we don't want to install too

00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:58,730
much other stuff except the video server

00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:01,160
perhaps but even the real server on the

00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:03,890
site of the client shouldn't be any

00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,829
additional software should be just a new

00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:10,609
real version fact the real server is

00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:12,289
only on the central part may be a few

00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:14,839
changes are required in the real

00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:17,690
software new variables you have to point

00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:21,319
to the real server in the sentry salt

00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:24,710
how do you want the data to be sent via

00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:27,200
email or via HTTP for example and some

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,960
other small things and maybe a bit of

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:34,579
bunch of scripts to plug in in the right

00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:37,359
spot the real server architecture could

00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:39,650
be like that it's not home present

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,989
defined we are still open for discussion

00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,730
and discusses are all going on the

00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:47,029
mailing list on developers mailing list

00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:49,759
of real so if you like it just subscribe

00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:50,480
yourself to the real mailing list of

00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:52,220
development

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,410
you can have a live discussion with us

00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,000
how do you want to see it what is the

00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,630
best approach because we have our own

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,950
ideas and we already know from past

00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:03,800
around these are maybe not always the

00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:05,570
best ideas so the more interacted trains

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,460
with the community the better and that

00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:11,480
we can choose the the best way to go

00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:13,880
forward so a central point could be an

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,440
ass server we could use my sequel nor

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,140
something else it's not one percenter

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,070
fight but okay Apache and PHP is

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:24,620
probably very useful and will be used we

00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:27,260
could just postfix as in delivery point

00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,960
but we had now the moment discusses to

00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:34,580
use web dev for example and using the

00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:37,880
HTTP or maybe even the the ssl link for

00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:40,760
a hand security very plausible

00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,310
discussions and we are really having

00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,740
good conversations around that so we are

00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:49,010
starting with it and that is a very good

00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:52,460
and very challenging for everybody so

00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:55,760
the design considerations okay a message

00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:58,250
a few of them but don't take it for

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:03,110
granted that this will be the final once

00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:06,230
we are still open for discussion I won't

00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:08,510
talk too much about it but okay thing is

00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:11,810
we'll use standard components like for

00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:15,740
example postfix like Apache PHP my Seco

00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:19,130
or another database and we don't want to

00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:21,170
use a demon so it should be something

00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,290
that you push in the current pose of

00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:25,970
course they have to be another way if

00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:28,580
you want to do a restore how do you do

00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:30,640
it do you do it fire suit yourself a

00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:33,050
command execution or something else

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,260
that's still not home presenta fire that

00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,260
okay

00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:42,660
okay the web Huey interface good the

00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:44,040
authentic case could be done by LDAP so

00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,580
I bet you can handle that for us

00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,880
Kerberos stuff like that this is only

00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:54,360
PAP scripts bind an Apache service oh

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,100
that's not so difficult to to create but

00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,200
it's interesting to have to have a

00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:04,260
central point that you all your systems

00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:08,250
are available and listed okay to be a

00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:11,400
server standard software okay the

00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:14,010
roadmap and almost this is the last

00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,490
light this is the roadmap to 1.5 at the

00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:20,700
1.0 hopefully will be released mid this

00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:22,500
year so that it is as a compliment for

00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,350
we're the devii server that we can

00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,630
happen and creating a service around

00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:30,030
disaster recovery which is very good

00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,619
very nice that have an extra

00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,580
functionality around disaster recovery

00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:39,060
and then of course their next steps but

00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:40,920
let's go to the first step first if you

00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,800
are want to contact us this is the

00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,170
website we are the maintainer do not

00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,470
hesitate to subscribe to yourself to the

00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:55,190
mailing list and that was it for the my

00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:55,190
talk I'm open for questions please suit

00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:08,790
sorry the question was can you service

00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:11,760
and directory where all the scripts are

00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:13,380
available or stored in on this PC I

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,780
cannot solve it because it's my disaster

00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:19,500
recovery PC my PC where everything was

00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,630
on did not respond on the it's all

00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,060
written in vs. cell written in cell

00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,800
scripts pure simple cell scripts and you

00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:29,340
can find everything under the slash USR

00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,230
share real sub directory and then you

00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,520
have a structure depending on the method

00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:38,160
to choose but it is explained quite well

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,980
in the concept guide how this structure

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,859
is aligned and how does it work and of

00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:47,100
course use the - steps as

00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:48,130
simulation - to solve which directories

00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,600
are effect

00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:53,290
executed and which scripts in the

00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,690
directories yes please yes the question

00:42:53,290 --> 00:43:00,400
is is this Linux only on this moment yes

00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:03,690
it is we are open for others because

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:08,290
this morning I took an CD from FreeBSD

00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:11,200
just to try it out but okay for the

00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:14,110
moment is only Linux we have a bun - we

00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,800
have red cat we have fedora we have all

00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:21,490
the others

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:23,590
please yes the Christmas parties layout

00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,440
is this also copied yes of course that's

00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,780
the basic of disaster recovery

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:32,310
everything that is reported to have an

00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,310
restoration of your system is copied

00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,900
the question is if you want to do an

00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:48,690
restauration of your partitioning on

00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,869
another hardware if you have to do it

00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,359
manually or not well that is the purpose

00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:58,650
of the new release that with the cloning

00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:01,500
p2v that the flexibility is built in the

00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:03,780
scripting that it will recognize other

00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:08,840
layouts and if needed

00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,840
it will propose your question yes please

00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:28,470
yeah the question was I did not like

00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,840
cloning software well I didn't like it

00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:33,680
for disaster recovery purpose and how do

00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,780
we solve it with rear well the thing is

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,460
real is made for disaster recovery so we

00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,890
had already in the back of our minds

00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:44,340
that not all heart is that we restore in

00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:46,620
our eco so therefore we using for

00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:49,110
example you def to recognize different

00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:51,660
hardware systems other types of hardware

00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:54,510
and it will propose you method to change

00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:57,420
for example and scusi disk with a SAS

00:44:54,510 --> 00:45:00,360
disk or another type of disk it will

00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,520
propose you that that this major step

00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,370
forward in a 1.9 that the colonic

00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,140
functionalities is more flexible in the

00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:09,300
previous releases it was much more

00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,700
strict and then you had to do some

00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,030
manual tweaks but we try to avoid it

00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,740
because like we said in a disaster

00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:19,260
environment it has to be automatically

00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:22,760
as much as possible and this kind of

00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:25,710
things we can affect trigger and

00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:29,670
interact with it to propose you a decent

00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:34,070
new style of underlying hardware for the

00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:34,070
network for the storage yes

00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:54,190
very this the question was what about

00:45:48,820 --> 00:46:00,760
personal systems within a basic ESX

00:45:54,190 --> 00:46:02,650
system for example yeah for for the

00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,870
moment if you are talking about the main

00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,570
system that carries the virtual systems

00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:09,550
it will restore the main system and the

00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:11,110
backups if you want it but it will not

00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:14,050
restore the personal systems if they are

00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:16,630
running because there's another kind of

00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:18,580
status so if you want to virtual systems

00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:20,290
they also backup or do an disaster

00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:23,590
costed roughly of the first of all

00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:26,400
systems in the companies that I work we

00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,400
do it like that also

00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:36,880
virtual machine has the the Christmas

00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,860
that we restore the first one machines

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,020
as with an ISO image we restore the

00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,830
virtual systems effect like we restore

00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:46,930
physical systems there's no difference

00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:52,020
they new methods of booting methods of

00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:52,020
restoring not the question yes

00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:11,250
I believe the question was what about

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:14,640
LVN in Debian okay Debian is on our list

00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:16,980
of supported hardware and software so

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,140
normally we have an abyss of test

00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:22,620
systems because I know disaster recovery

00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:25,530
is a pain to test always so we cannot

00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:28,730
test everything but normally by my

00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:32,790
knowledge Debian is working quite well

00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:34,800
and for the moment we don't have tested

00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:36,720
everything of course but as far as we

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,940
know that it is working quite well waste

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:44,400
less lives earlier this less away

00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:47,970
fedoras redheads Ubuntu and Debian there

00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,790
on most tested environments and there

00:47:47,970 --> 00:48:00,180
are others on the list

00:47:50,790 --> 00:48:03,030
other questions bonus for Sam

00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:07,530
the question was what kind of send

00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:10,490
components do we support any can kind of

00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:13,830
sin that is your linux is supporting if

00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:16,320
the linux is supporting the drivers if

00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:18,270
you use them they will automatically be

00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:23,340
copied to the rescue image and they will

00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:26,970
be activated automatically so we're

00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:31,320
using for example in some companies the

00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:38,720
XP storage or EMC stores that's quite

00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:38,720
transparent another question

00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,920
distribution specific configuration

00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:45,480
files do you need with every new

00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,580
distribution worship do you need to

00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:51,080
update a set of information-gathering

00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,080
file or

00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:58,400
or do you update configuration file

00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:01,460
forever grief and how much work no the

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,320
question is for every new release do we

00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,119
have to update the local configuration

00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:09,890
files of your or your site configuration

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:12,530
files no not that not really it's always

00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:15,349
backwards compatible so if you do an

00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:18,220
upgrade with rpm the local conference

00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:18,220
file is always saved

00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:44,990
ok the quest was with a new release for

00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:47,540
example if Fedora does real also needs

00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:50,089
new versions of it well to instant a new

00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:52,400
version yes that's true for example to

00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:54,140
keep it very simple this is the last

00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:58,520
question might be a simple explanation

00:49:54,140 --> 00:50:01,040
of it we have up start to bolt your

00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,920
systems we have this is six-five init

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,859
environment and with the new Fedora

00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,890
which is still not available the 15 we

00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:12,170
will using system D system D is not yet

00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:15,170
supported it's on my list for the coming

00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:17,540
weeks that for the 1.9 release I decided

00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:19,550
to do not support it yet because I did

00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,710
not have the time to to roll it out to

00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,960
test everything again so it was decided

00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:25,910
to make an newer version within a couple

00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,580
of weeks that supports the new boots
