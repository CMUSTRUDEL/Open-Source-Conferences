this presentation is about an

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,480
introduction to free and open source

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,650
software and we tried to see what is

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,969
important someone would say still

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:18,300
important today and small print there

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,939
says free and open source or technology

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:26,369
I didn't make that up it's it's actually

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:29,990
my academic achievement that's my the

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:33,630
tittle my the title of my master and

00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,489
it's it's gonna be probably a boring

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,230
presentation if especially if you're

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,140
into software because I'm gonna go

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,649
through some history some legal issues

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:51,539
but I'll try to keep to keep the rhythm

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:55,620
up so you don't fall asleep so so so the

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,739
first thing we need to introduce is what

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,160
is software probably already know every

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,159
time I don't know something a lot quick

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,680
benya and comes out with this definition

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,159
which I'm not really happy about this

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,270
the part of a computer system a consists

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,470
of data or instructions and immediately

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,560
introduced the contrast with the

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,040
hardware which is fine but then at this

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:27,150
point I prepare the definition I miss

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,680
blue that's this one and it's a part of

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,250
the system that you can't actually kick

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,280
when you stop working that's what my

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:41,220
teacher at University explained me so

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:44,310
this is more or less these are two

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,340
definitions we can be okay with but

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,439
actually a software it's a small complex

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,159
that just they just saying okay it's not

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,619
part of the technology you can touch and

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,560
because it's made of mathematics and

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,409
it's make it's made of algorithms and we

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,530
know that the algorithms are these

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:11,780
formal methods that help you solving

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:13,620
problems so it's a kind of a process

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,750
software creation that

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:22,440
buff's maybe two actors as the human

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,170
brain and some sort of machine right and

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,840
at some point the human brain comes up

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:34,920
with an idea and it wants to describe

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:38,519
this idea to the machine in a formal way

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,200
in a unambiguous deterministic way and

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:45,120
that's how software is created it's

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:48,989
basically using a language we just form

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,920
our idea into mathematical tools if you

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:56,459
want we write a set of rules for the

00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,510
machine to execute in a specific order

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,640
and then we give it to the machine and

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:10,950
the machine will produce the expected

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:13,170
results so that's more the big view on

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,049
on software and the process of creating

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:20,430
software but associating this with

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:23,069
computers well and unless you you you

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,750
consider this a computer which was

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:30,450
actually the famous Babbage analytical

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,690
engine was completely mechanical so it

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:38,849
doesn't use transistors or integrated

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:40,650
circuits as we used to today but it was

00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,859
already possible to write software for

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:48,780
this machine this machine was made in

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:54,269
the in the early 18th 19th century

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:58,590
so in 1800 something and this person was

00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:01,109
the person who the first time theorized

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,959
the existence of something such as

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,449
software you know so you probably know

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:11,250
her already she's lady

00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:15,900
Lovelace she was the daughter of Lord

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:19,070
Byron one of the most important figures

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,840
on the English literature and she

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,000
actually managed to write the first

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,000
piece of software which is already which

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,850
is still available in a

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,470
zoom and it's of course public domain

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:36,350
and and she realized actually the

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:40,480
machines that are not made for single

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,890
purpose but like that like Babbage

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,690
analytical engine can actually do

00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:50,510
whatever you want

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:55,280
so she said the analytical engine has no

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:58,570
pretensions to do something on its own

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,790
it's it's about us instructing it

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,130
through a number of steps to do

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,900
something so that's what software is

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,530
that's the first definition of software

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:13,700
back in 1842 well she also say other

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:16,280
things like this brain of mine it's more

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,260
than merely mortal the time will show

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:25,280
and she was right actually because she's

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:28,370
genius so long what was actually very

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,520
important for the definition of software

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,360
itself it's a bit like the second half

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,430
of the last century it's a bit of a

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:42,740
strange history because everybody tells

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:47,770
it in their way so mentioning some

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:53,090
people rather than others but we can all

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:56,330
agree on the fact that the hacker ethics

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,440
has actually created before the

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:02,300
computers were accessible to people and

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,190
and the goal was actually to have access

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,440
to those computers to do something

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:10,760
because it was something that there was

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:15,220
reserved for university for like the old

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:21,729
professors to play with or big

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:25,340
corporations like IBM but there was like

00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:28,250
the development of digital culture came

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:34,340
before the existence of software itself

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:37,099
and ok we can also include lady Lovelace

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,690
in this terminology because actually

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:39,480
what was her problem she she had this

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,180
his

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Jeanne and nobody knew how to make it

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,550
work so she had to invent something a

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,980
language to talk to it and also she

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,230
wrote programs that could run on this

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,800
pathetic machine even if it was not

00:06:52,230 --> 00:07:00,600
built before another 30 years but these

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:06,750
guys back in the forties were enthused

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:09,410
about building train models because it

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,660
was something that you could actually

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:15,600
disassemble reassemble and human

00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:21,120
optimized so it had something to do with

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:25,940
the way we use now to look at things so

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:30,680
this group of people like the model

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:34,710
Riedel Railroad Club at some point

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:38,730
became students at MIT were already

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:41,340
master suited and and then they met this

00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:46,530
professor this president Marvin Minsky

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:51,450
who gave them the access to this big

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:54,450
powerful machine dx0 and was available

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:58,830
for them to play and learn during off

00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:00,740
time what what was the outcome in a few

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:08,850
years these guys were able to be right

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:11,280
the first video game to theorize AI to

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:15,140
learn to to teach the computer to play

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,950
chess and even to invent the

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,040
second-oldest programming language known

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:23,610
to humans and still the oldest one

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:26,540
that's still in use today that's Lisp so

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,040
in other words they helped a lot

00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,590
defining the software as we know it

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:37,560
today but what they was they were

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:40,320
starting as well was the the hacker the

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,500
hacker community that was starting in

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,680
these days at MIT and later on even in

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,560
California when some some of them moved

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,040
to Berkeley and met other people that

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:58,980
that made the history during the

00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:00,210
60s and 70s and did you write the points

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,660
they were the first one to terrorise the

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:05,430
points of the hacker ethics actually so

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,490
way before the era of the personal

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,170
computer and that's that's mostly

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,480
because of the struggle to access these

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,660
kind of technologies that were something

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,760
for for analytic people and still will

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:23,310
remain like that until the personal

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:25,680
computers will get to to everyone so

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:30,750
what are these ethics and I think this

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:33,480
is still very actual it's for for is

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,130
something that was written thinking

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,160
about today in a way it's I mean

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:41,370
impressed by this this points here it's

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,590
like okay maybe we don't have the top

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:49,500
problem anymore because accessing

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:53,040
technology hands on it is still struggle

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:57,020
if the technology is proprietary or

00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,360
close source but we will get there later

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,370
but all the other ones on information

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,650
should be free not even your own

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,220
information is free to access to

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,720
yourself

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,960
yeah they fixing that now but very

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,730
slowly mistrustful tourists our

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:17,670
authority promote decentralization

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:20,490
it's a Cena nice graffiti entering here

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:23,270
it's like the ideas should never stand

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:27,000
back and that's about it if you think

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:29,220
something you should not just go with

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,890
the flow if you have good ideas you

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:39,680
should always try to build something out

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:43,260
of it not to centralize everything and

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,050
well there was already a big deal of

00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:51,960
inclusion and and in the fourth point

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:54,630
there because we it was very early to

00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,130
say that hackers should be judged on

00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:04,560
what they do and not what they are for

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:06,520
age race sex gender whatever and this is

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,160
very important because

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,350
yes you can create art and beauty on a

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,820
computer when you explain and

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:18,399
non-technical friends what they do I I

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,310
told them that my mind is a very

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:25,480
creative job and I really enjoy doing

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:28,690
art with the computer but actually what

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,089
I do is I'd write software for micro

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:34,480
electronics for the micro toy industry

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:37,000
so from from from an outside point of

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,820
view I understand that they struggle to

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,630
understand - to just focus on the on the

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,940
artistic and creative part of my job but

00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:50,500
doing like writing software is something

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:52,120
very special and of course well it took

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,399
a while for us to understand but

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,640
computers can change our life for the

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,640
better

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:07,360
well in the 70s some some of the of

00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:13,750
these MIT students moved to to

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:18,100
California and someone like this student

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:21,070
called Bill Gates started writing the

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,750
basic programming language and they

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:27,040
found that already Microsoft back in

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,779
1975 and I mean meanwhile Steve Wozniak

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,529
was building the Apple 2 in his garage

00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:37,200
and the other state was ready to sell it

00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:43,660
because it was already done pretty good

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:45,970
business person but what does it mean

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:51,130
that the hacker community these guys

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:53,829
this enthusiasts got to providing

00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:57,070
personal computer to to the people way

00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:59,760
before the big figures they're like the

00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,380
big corporates at the time HP and IBM

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,200
could even figure out there was such a

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,200
market so they got there first

00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:13,690
what happened afterwards is like home

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,949
computer were introduced we start having

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,830
all this nice Commodore 64 Sinclair's

00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:22,860
back through my home

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:25,310
and I was a kid I did have a syncretic

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,649
spectrum I remember that I could go to

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:31,860
the newspaper shop in the eighties and

00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:33,930
buy those cassettes with with videogames

00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,940
on earth but they were not the original

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,370
video games because they were cloned

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,290
from the originals translated to Italian

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,240
with a complete different name

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,440
sometimes even the sprites were changed

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,260
because the source code was there nobody

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,300
actually had the idea of ownership of

00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:56,339
the software you create software but

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,930
it's like writing down an algebraic

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:01,170
equation for instance it's not something

00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:06,149
that they could think about having some

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:09,269
kind of ownership on it some kind of

00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:11,970
copyright that that that came later so

00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:15,120
the software actually was already born

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,740
free in the sense that everyone could do

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,420
whatever they want with it

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:25,200
just before we or some company realized

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:27,480
that it was easy money to do it like you

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,520
make software once you copy it as many

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,220
times as you want and you can sell

00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,310
license fees for each copy use yourself

00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:41,339
so it's it's a nice business model so

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:45,839
the legislation kind of followed these

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:49,110
indications from from from companies and

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,890
of course the copyright law was modified

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:56,670
in many countries in Europe to include

00:14:52,890 --> 00:15:03,449
software as it was a novel or a piece of

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:07,620
music or painting so that's how the two

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:10,110
words met but before that proprietary

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,410
software never existed so some people

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,480
that were like a bit concerned about

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,510
this like we're introducing the concept

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:22,079
of copyright and ownership on on

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:24,300
something like software that we as an

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,699
act as a hacker community we always

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:30,600
consider something I was public for

00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:33,070
everyone but that's a normal process of

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,380
course because if you write something

00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:37,750
and it starts to have that artistic

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,230
value I was talking about so it's not

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:44,339
that bad to have this kind of regulation

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:46,180
it's just that this guy Stallman was

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:49,240
very against it

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,980
and he started his own project and they

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,410
started writing this new project because

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,720
the most popular operating system of the

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,069
time was Unix

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,490
but it also came with the strong

00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:02,829
ownership from from big companies so he

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:07,560
said I'm gonna write one that's free for

00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:11,170
everyone but he hasn't yet theorized

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:15,430
what the license model should have been

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:18,009
that came later later on this project

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,620
was not very successful in the 80s or

00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:23,889
the beginning of the 90s but for a

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:27,220
simple reason these guys seem to fail to

00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:29,709
write the core component the the kernel

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,350
where this operating system could could

00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:37,329
run on but yeah probably you already

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:38,260
know the story this young students in

00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,260
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:45,730
Torvalds sons emails and saying hey

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:48,639
wrote this kernel and that turns out to

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,560
be the missing components for the GNU

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,649
project but in the meanwhile what

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,120
happened in the 90s is that personal

00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:57,240
computer were replacing this home

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,000
computer that we had in the eighties and

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,730
there was one strong players I was the

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,449
Microsoft that was founded back in 1995

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:11,199
and had a lot of project products and

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:20,199
they tried to lock in the users with all

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:23,559
the ways they could so even making some

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:27,220
versions of the software available to

00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:31,390
the public for free especially on the

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:35,590
office set to ensure that people are

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:38,799
forced in a way to stay in that railway

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:42,490
of technology that they defined so they

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,460
can guarantee the return on revenue on

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,929
those product the problem is there is

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,039
nothing wrong with it

00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:53,769
how the market works to me is that this

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,499
process also in English at the public

00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:58,990
administration in many cases which means

00:17:56,499 --> 00:18:02,499
that a lot of public money started

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:05,919
flowing on a single big player in the

00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:07,929
market already back in the 90s but it

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,230
was already happening since the

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:17,259
introduction of copyright of course and

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:20,470
the commercialization of software Linux

00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:22,690
in the meanwhile 90s the beginning it

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:26,080
was just a few followers of this

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:28,929
stalwart turbo guy mostly people that

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:35,499
are very integers about programming in C

00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:37,990
with the system and and decide what what

00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:40,179
would the system the public system for

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,039
everyone will look like but it starts

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:45,840
living in snitch it's not conquering

00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:48,970
parts of the of the technology that

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:53,980
we're it actually makes a difference so

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:57,730
mostly the server so web servers most

00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:01,659
web servers switched to free and open

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:05,379
source solution running on Linux already

00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:10,179
very early in the days and a few new

00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:13,720
companies are born on defining a

00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:15,700
different market value than just selling

00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,899
license fees and I'm talking about

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:23,669
Red Hat Suzy and other companies that

00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:27,460
have contributed making Linux great

00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:30,399
making X what it's today by investing

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:34,330
money in in the development of this free

00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:38,440
software and moving bit shifting the

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:42,369
development of Linux from from the

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:46,059
basement of hobbyists to an actual

00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:49,809
corporate environment so also

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:52,869
introducing different kind of quality

00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:55,830
metrics etc and their business model is

00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:59,529
not anymore

00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,880
on on on license fees but it's based on

00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,970
selling services

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,590
or other more complex business models

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:11,290
that we're not we're not discussing here

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:15,580
then again what happened in 2000 the

00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:17,350
good good software as in well written it

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:21,390
becomes popular again popular again

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:24,450
because a lot of network devices like

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:27,750
your routers and access points at home

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:31,360
are being replaced with link machine

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:34,150
Linux becomes mostly popular on the

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,630
mobile market thanks to Google that

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:40,330
makes this open-source nog new version

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:43,540
of Linux the runs on after the mobile

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:48,070
phones in the world and this company

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:53,620
Apple so that's in 10-15 years of dark

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:56,590
age with dubious products on the market

00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:00,570
suddenly against popularity again which

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,570
is good because it gives a bit of

00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:10,150
diversity on the market because you know

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:12,010
anymore type of one single brand so this

00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:17,920
way you make space board for the third

00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:22,900
one yes there is a few good achievement

00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:27,490
that we have had in the past two decades

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:30,370
and especially we know that good

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,500
technology well-written software can

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,110
prevail on the market because when the

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:39,940
companies are interested in how things

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:42,160
work it's not any more about how much

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:47,320
money you spend but it's a the results

00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:50,560
that that lets you achieve so there is

00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:55,030
some kind of victory for someone who

00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:58,810
lived this from the inside it's it feels

00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,610
good to have Linux as one of the that's

00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:04,030
the most important probably software

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:10,530
project right now in the world and so

00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:10,530
much popular in almost everyone's pocket

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:16,330
but let's go back for a moment on what

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:19,740
is software so software is made of what

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:23,350
it is made of ideas it's made of

00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:27,100
algorithms and it's made of solutions

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:29,380
but it's so it's it's a matter of form

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,040
rather than substance that said things

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,300
that you don't find in software's like

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:38,440
atoms or molecules or something a

00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:42,460
composed matter so why do I get here

00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,590
because some people still especially

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,140
politicians don't understand this

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,320
separation so they still treat software

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,480
as a product as something you can sell

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,730
but it's just a matter of forum as if

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,370
you to get to programmers and you tell

00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,770
them to write the same thing they will

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,030
use two different technologies probably

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,730
two different programming language and

00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,680
come out with something that they don't

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,210
look like each other but probably in the

00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,730
end they will do the same thing so look

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:13,650
at how many possibilities have we have

00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:16,480
for us every single software that we can

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:18,940
that we can use nowadays and that's

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,400
because different communities different

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,490
groups different companies have worked

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,740
on a similar products but they're not

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,140
exactly the same but this is not

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:32,950
plagiarism because if you start from a

00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:36,340
from a from a blank sheet you can start

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:41,650
writing a novel yourself and it's just a

00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:45,700
matter of form if the butler is is the

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:48,130
killer in my police novel it should be

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:53,730
already in several of them but doesn't

00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:56,950
mean that needs look like the others so

00:23:53,730 --> 00:24:00,040
the software ownership it is a matter of

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,750
form it is never a matter of content so

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,530
if I do something and you do something

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:07,390
looks similar to it to the users eye it

00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,730
doesn't mean that we use the same code

00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,810
and we if we didn't those are two

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:16,210
different things

00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:19,360
so all these words and patterns you can

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:22,360
imagine it's just pointless because we

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,419
will talk about two different recipes to

00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,840
make

00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:32,350
she cannot go down but if it if it

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:37,309
tastes good and it's not not plagiarism

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:39,980
so this is important because a lot of

00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:43,730
companies corporate lobbyists have tried

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:47,720
to introduce the the concept of software

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:50,929
patents and they've been trying for

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:54,350
years actually and it may even look nice

00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:56,059
as a concept because it means that you

00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,460
know when you put a patent on something

00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:02,840
you need to release every single bit

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:05,929
about it from the laitanan pattern which

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:12,309
means to lay open to show to the

00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:15,799
universe and but this only applies to

00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:19,100
physical things like if I if I do this I

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:22,909
design it for the first time it's a nice

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:25,850
object I can put a patent on it and then

00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:28,009
I will exclude all my competitors to

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:32,419
produce it because that's my invention

00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:34,429
and but this is as a cost for me to

00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:36,919
produce it has a cost for me to put on

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:39,200
the market it is different it's not a

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,879
concept I can put patterns and concepts

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:47,149
so this is just pointers right it's a

00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:49,759
luckily we still resisting from

00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:55,159
introducing this kind of model on

00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:57,159
software and that's not mmm that's not

00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,690
the case everywhere because in the u.s.

00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:02,269
if you're powerful enough you can still

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:06,470
put patents on software so you can still

00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:09,710
patent ideas which is a bit scary what

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:15,109
are the regulations about software

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:18,409
software is regulated by the we've seen

00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:22,070
the copyright law so you can't sell it

00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:25,249
so when you say I bought that product

00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:27,859
from that software company you didn't

00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:29,869
buy the product you actually sign the

00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:32,359
contract with them that's very similar

00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:34,590
to a rental contract when you rent a new

00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:38,549
house it's

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,950
it's about defining what you're allowed

00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:44,789
and not allowed to do within the

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:48,059
boundaries that who granted you software

00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:54,809
license decide for you and you can

00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:59,309
decide of of course to accept or or not

00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:01,860
that this kind of contract but that's

00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:03,710
still how it works you don't by actually

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,220
anything so if there's not a product and

00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:09,720
that's actually out is regulated in

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:15,870
European countries through the copyright

00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:19,669
law so these licenses basically the the

00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:23,520
proprietary licenses are there to put

00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:25,520
walls and borders around where you could

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,279
move while using the software

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:33,419
open-source licenses are just the

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,880
opposite as we've seen they were they

00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:37,409
were created as a reaction to the

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,960
introduction of proprietary proprietary

00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:43,860
software because never existed before

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:49,350
the eighties to put back things as they

00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:51,960
were before and yeah this the whole

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:55,919
discussion of course implies that that

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,330
you read the software agreement the

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,289
terms of agreement of the software that

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:03,750
that you're going to use but you are

00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:05,720
bound to agree to the rules that are

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:09,210
written there

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,970
so the open-source words to make it

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:15,029
really really really simple as basically

00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:19,320
two approaches the number one approach

00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:21,360
is permissive licenses it's like the BSD

00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,059
license it's a it's what is normally

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:28,520
called open source in a broader in a

00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:32,370
broader sense and the BSD license says

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:37,140
do whatever you want basically except to

00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:39,870
us but on the other hand you be so kind

00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:43,200
if you really really become rich with it

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:46,110
you should still mention the original

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,860
authors in your copyright notice to give

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,419
them some glory

00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,600
that's what opens

00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:54,179
looks like which is not the not really

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,609
ideal because if I'm a big company and

00:28:54,179 --> 00:29:00,600
I'm really interested in the software

00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:04,200
that Walters is writing I can just steal

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,869
it make it better not release it back to

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,389
the open source he will still keep his

00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:11,159
own version which is lagging behind

00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:13,379
because in the meanwhile I had new

00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,440
features I had that I fixed some bugs

00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:18,869
I'll never tell him and my version is

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,179
clearly better and that's money and time

00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:24,299
on it so I will sell it on the market

00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:30,809
but what comes back to the original

00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:33,840
developers is clearly nothing so the

00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:39,119
same guy behind the new Ranger storm and

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:41,299
I wanted to have UNIX for everyone he

00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:45,659
invented this new kind of license that

00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:48,350
free software license they also called

00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,840
the gnu general public license which is

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:54,929
different because it's less permissive

00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:59,249
so it's a bit of clash with the term

00:29:54,929 --> 00:30:02,009
free but the term free in this case

00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:04,350
means you need to provide freedom to

00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:07,169
your next user and it's done through the

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,269
four freedoms so the freedom number zero

00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:11,909
and it's exactly the opposite as

00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:14,239
proprietary software so closed source is

00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:17,759
only one part of the problem

00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:18,359
freedom 0 is use it for whatever purpose

00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,379
you want

00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:24,690
so anything even to make weapons or

00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:27,389
whatever we don't care because you're

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,730
free to use the software for any purpose

00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:32,909
that was designed for some purpose

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:36,389
probably but you're free to be adapted

00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:39,389
to anything you're free to study it

00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:40,950
because what's the point of running

00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:45,239
something if you don't know what's

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:50,129
inside it it's just a black box and you

00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:53,489
don't get very much from it or at least

00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:54,989
you are kind of one of the machines in

00:30:53,489 --> 00:30:57,239
the in the in the distributed system

00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:58,679
because you're using it but just through

00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:01,500
the part that you were indicated so

00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,440
you're you're making basically

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,340
set of predictable steps you're elected

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,070
aridity Babbage machine basically but

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:13,290
you are just facing another machine so

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:15,300
it's a bit sad the fact that you can't

00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:18,390
actually read the code that's probably

00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:22,920
one of the departed that people like the

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,460
least but also and not just if you stop

00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,400
there

00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,170
you get some years called the microf

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,100
shared source license I think works like

00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:35,010
this so you're free to use it and you're

00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,830
free to look into it but that's it don't

00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,300
even think about touching it but what I

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,640
want to do with this software is

00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,400
changing it and making it better because

00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,270
what the software is great but yes a few

00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:53,640
things that can be improved so I just

00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:56,130
move words action and improve the

00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,110
software water but not for myself for

00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:02,400
everyone because the rule number three

00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:04,830
the last of the four rules says you are

00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:10,020
entitled to redistribute all the

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:11,970
derivatives but you must keep granting

00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,460
the four licenses to the next part to

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:17,130
the four freedoms to the next person so

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,560
the software should still be within the

00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:23,970
same license so some people call this

00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:26,610
viral but it's not bad it's actually it

00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:30,300
keeps the market fair it keeps the

00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:32,550
ecosystem working so I'd rather use

00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,300
something like this for software right

00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:38,310
than the open source permissive licenses

00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,430
but of course this is always a matter of

00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:45,920
bias and taste and personal history and

00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:53,210
whatever they are obviously both have a

00:32:45,920 --> 00:33:00,440
good history of nice project and working

00:32:53,210 --> 00:33:04,680
truck also in in trials so in in actual

00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:10,290
low environment so there are communities

00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:12,080
that were able to to sue big companies

00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:15,330
because they violated one of those

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:20,510
freedoms so this is powerful

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:23,250
this is powerful weapon but of course a

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:25,500
lot of companies yeah I think this is

00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:29,160
viral because oh my god

00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:32,880
all our sources is immediately becoming

00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:35,430
free for everyone but making software

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,290
making money on software licenses it's

00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:41,580
some legacy we have from the past it's

00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:44,450
not a model that's working still in 2018

00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:48,000
it's we now sell services we saw

00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:50,850
experience we don't sell software

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,500
licenses that clashes a bit with with

00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,520
the degree of technology we have reached

00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,630
so far

00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:00,630
and if you open your code it doesn't

00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:05,420
doesn't mean that you're not gonna make

00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:07,830
money with it because there are many

00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,050
business models that are that are based

00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:13,230
on on free end software and open source

00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:15,090
software licenses yes probably you're

00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:18,180
not making billions probably not like

00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:21,880
founding Microsoft again but I don't

00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:23,450
think that there are like historical

00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,190
[Music]

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:29,550
basis to do something like this right

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:35,820
now what we should be focused on and

00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:39,440
should be mostly a way to guarantee a

00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:42,510
fair market for everyone to get in from

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,660
small software artisans to the big

00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:48,590
company everyone should be able to make

00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:51,900
money with with what they do because

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:55,260
software development is it's a hell of a

00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:58,410
job is very fun but it means you lose

00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,810
sleep and it impacts on your life in a

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:03,300
way so you want to get some something

00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:07,050
back from it but of course there's a

00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:10,560
there are many ways to do this and of

00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:12,930
course there is always these companies

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,580
that say no we don't release our source

00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:18,990
code because we don't like it it's a and

00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,120
my doubt is always the same

00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:24,570
are they not releasing it because the

00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,400
code is damn ugly and I cannot show you

00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:28,620
I've seen some code that was not

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,870
released under an NDA

00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:34,590
from some customers I work for and

00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:36,390
that's the case 90% of the time they

00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,400
don't want to show the code because the

00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,260
code sucks because it's completely

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,690
unreadable it's difficult to maintain

00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,570
and they don't want to associate those

00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:48,570
lines of code to their logo that's why

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:51,600
companies don't release software on open

00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:55,110
source licenses most of the time because

00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:58,230
there is not much of a huge advantage

00:35:55,110 --> 00:36:00,240
right now for how the things have

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:08,150
changed to keep proprietary software

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:10,590
closed source on on software products so

00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:14,970
proprietary software is not always paid

00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:19,080
it can be free as in gratis so three

00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:22,680
years in free beer let's say but not as

00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,360
in freedom not as in the for freedom but

00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,940
it doesn't mean that lock doesn't lock

00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:30,090
you in because it doesn't ask you money

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,370
it can still be like completely closed

00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:35,820
source this is the this is the case

00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:38,150
probably for thousands of apps for for

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:41,040
mobile phone they don't ask you money

00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:44,970
but you will never be able to see the

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,520
code and that's also bad because we're

00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:49,230
not fighting against the high price of

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,140
the software here we're fighting against

00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:55,770
the whole concept of hiding your

00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:57,210
technology in something that's that you

00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:00,810
don't want to show to the other people

00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:06,540
how it works so and of course from for

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:09,480
people like hackers this is bit annoying

00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,270
it is frustrating because you you will

00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,540
never know how it works you have no

00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:17,880
ideas who wrote it you need to be

00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:20,310
trusting them under percent so if you

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,620
get a computer and you put your nice

00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:25,470
Apple operating system or Windows

00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:28,610
operating system you will never know

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:32,640
what it is doing in its core because

00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:35,490
disorder did you not able to look at and

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,880
actually the software how it was written

00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,880
so

00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:45,700
and also limits all the other kinds of

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,170
licenses of freedom sorry that the

00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:51,340
targeted in the in the free software

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:54,130
license because normally in a EULA in an

00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:57,400
end-user License Agreement of one of

00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:59,380
those software they stayed clearly what

00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:04,180
kind of actions you can perform and what

00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:09,610
you can not and for sure it won't let

00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:13,290
you copy it to your friends and this is

00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:16,840
funny close as many proprietary systems

00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:19,360
include which is completely invalid in

00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,570
within the EU that's against the reverse

00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:25,330
engineering so let's say you want to

00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,230
know how something works and you start

00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:29,230
tearing it apart

00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:32,350
and checking each component and trying

00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,610
to figure out bit as you did with your

00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:36,100
choice when you're when you were a kid

00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:40,060
or with your PlayStation 3 when you had

00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:41,350
to modify it or you can do the same

00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:44,200
thing with the with software there are

00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:47,220
like programs like these assemblers that

00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:51,490
let you know what actions the machine is

00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:54,760
its performing step by step please keep

00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:57,010
using those keep looking inside the

00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,020
software and check what it is doing even

00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,970
if the code is not available because

00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,850
even if the light it says it's you can't

00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:07,270
do that well as long as you are within

00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:10,510
the European Union it's it's your own

00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:15,850
damn right to do it to start checking

00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:19,380
and seeing why the software is getting

00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:24,610
in that specific way and of course

00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:27,100
that's that's a very very sad note about

00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:29,560
properties of proprietary software like

00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:33,550
a lot of the money in a public in the

00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:36,400
public administration is still going to

00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:39,520
big software corporations to licenses

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,140
that are granted to a specific structure

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,450
just imagine I don't know how many

00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,090
hospitals are in Brussels probably eight

00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:48,880
or ten just imagine each one of those

00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:53,260
ospa does need to buy license for the

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:56,440
same software many many times and the

00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:58,120
just adds up to the to the cost if we

00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:02,050
add the different way of doing these

00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:04,210
things that would be much more visual it

00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,390
would be much better for our society but

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:10,210
also much more convenient for our

00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:12,550
pockets because a lot of public money go

00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:16,030
there so probably a lot of your taxes go

00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:22,150
there as well and okay I have a video to

00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:26,290
show you which explains why if the

00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:29,770
software is is down prefer for a public

00:40:26,290 --> 00:41:12,820
purpose it should be public itself open

00:40:29,770 --> 00:41:14,620
source and free as well a brand-new June

00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:18,520
is already been torn down

00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:22,220
just six months it's been replaced with

00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:25,280
an expense

00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,280
[Music]

00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:38,130
and sensitive information on citizens

00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:42,000
from bad data to healthcare records are

00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:44,579
being stolen but no one is allowed to do

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,010
anything about it because searching for

00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:51,539
backdoors and blocking them would

00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:54,210
infringe this and as absurd as this

00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:56,369
sounds when it comes to our digital

00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:58,289
infrastructure things like the software

00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:00,869
and programs that our governments are

00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:04,380
using every day this comparison is

00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:06,930
pretty accurate because mostly our

00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:10,260
administration's procure proprietary

00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:13,170
software this means a lot of money goes

00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,640
into licenses that lasts for a limited

00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:19,170
amount of time and respect and loss we

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,400
aren't allowed to use our infrastructure

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:26,010
in a reasonable way because the source

00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,339
code of proprietary software is usually

00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:31,440
a business secret finding security holes

00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:34,490
or deliberately installed backdoors is

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,490
extremely difficult

00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:41,430
public administrations can do better if

00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:44,789
all publicly financed software were to

00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:47,010
be free and open-source we could use and

00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:49,349
share our infrastructure for anything

00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:58,950
and for as long as we wanted we could

00:42:49,349 --> 00:43:02,549
upgrade it anyway and the cost the open

00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:21,210
source in free software is openly

00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:25,410
readable for everyone can be deployed

00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:28,589
any way internationally a great example

00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:30,359
of this is fix my street originally

00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:32,520
developed in Great Britain as a free

00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:35,880
software app to report view and discuss

00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:39,210
local problems like potholes it's now

00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,579
being used all over the world everyone

00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:44,309
benefits because new features and

00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:47,099
improvements are shared by everyone if

00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:49,920
all our software were developed like

00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:52,589
this we could stop struggling with

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,049
restrictive licenses and could start

00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:57,630
thinking about where and how software

00:43:55,049 --> 00:44:00,059
could help us we could concentrate on

00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:03,089
creating a better society for everyone

00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:05,039
so if you think that tomorrow's

00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:07,369
infrastructure should be in our own

00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:07,369
hands

00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:40,969
okay so you worried yet what are the

00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:43,789
action that we can do at this point as a

00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:46,029
user it could be more critical there are

00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:49,759
alternatives to in software AG is to

00:44:46,029 --> 00:44:53,109
every day okay sometimes this means

00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:56,420
being out of your network of parents for

00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:59,719
your the latest messaging or social

00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:02,719
media whatever but yeah I've been

00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:05,359
through this and that's not that bad I

00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:07,759
mean it just if you are a developer it's

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:10,359
even better because it just pushes you

00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:15,109
in improving what's what's really there

00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:18,109
but as a developer you can do much you

00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:19,009
can learn new stuff that's number one if

00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:22,130
you stop learning

00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:24,019
it just stuck again in the same kind of

00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:26,539
technology and that something you can't

00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:29,359
afford software itself is something else

00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:31,369
moving and developers can't be static

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,160
so never sit down on your own knowledge

00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:36,249
just if you think you know too much just

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,259
go ahead and and learn something new and

00:45:36,249 --> 00:45:40,519
there are so many interesting

00:45:38,259 --> 00:45:42,680
technologies and so many interesting

00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:46,549
communities out there in the open source

00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,960
and free software world that just

00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:52,190
they're just waiting for you basically

00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:54,109
and they are all eager to to to guide

00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,430
you through their own technology because

00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:59,029
they are usually very passionate about

00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:00,920
the what they did so yeah start

00:45:59,029 --> 00:46:03,829
contributing sort search your own

00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,319
project but most important join some

00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:08,450
communities there is in Brussels there

00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:14,200
is your space there is a second formatic

00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:14,200
here at two bits it's this kind of

00:46:14,259 --> 00:46:20,029
technology knowledge enhancement places

00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:21,739
because you get there you show people

00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:24,589
what you've done people will show you

00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:28,400
what what they have done and what you

00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:30,049
bought come out very enriched by that of

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,619
course there is stuff that companies can

00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:36,700
do as well like sponsors open open

00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:40,640
source project and ideas for their

00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:41,900
employees to evolve because that's also

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,950
means that they're learning new things

00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:49,340
and becoming better professional adopt

00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:54,980
open standards so start refusing

00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:59,110
lock-ins policies like big company can

00:46:54,980 --> 00:47:02,150
come out tomorrow with the new way of

00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:06,770
visualizing webpages that they decided

00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:09,830
on their own but it was not like they

00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:12,710
didn't go to a research a scientific

00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:16,760
path that open standards and protocols

00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:20,600
and technologies went through to assess

00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,940
a wider range of problems that are not

00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:30,440
specific for its prefer a single

00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:34,130
business model and of course yeah it's

00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:37,490
it's all about the mentality of not

00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:40,550
hiding stuff it's just showing what you

00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:44,090
can do but new battles are there it's

00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:45,830
just it's not just the fact of the of

00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:48,080
the closed door proprietary software

00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:50,930
that's worrying the technological

00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,240
society and that has to do with with the

00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:55,310
with the hacker ethics we discussed

00:47:53,240 --> 00:48:00,470
earlier because the new battle is

00:47:55,310 --> 00:48:03,560
actually played on decentralization free

00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:06,170
and open software is not enough alone it

00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:09,380
has been a powerful weapon but it's not

00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:11,330
enough because big companies have

00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:15,050
learned from their mistakes and they

00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:18,110
start implementing open source software

00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:20,840
they learned how to use it and how to

00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:23,480
get through communities alter licenses

00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:29,750
make them sign contribution agreements

00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:31,430
etc and but be careful because the the

00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:35,390
goal of the of the face of the community

00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:37,430
is not to destroy capitalism even if my

00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:41,530
own opinion it would be a nice side

00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:45,590
effect but on in general we are not like

00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:50,050
trying to mine the profit we're trying

00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:54,319
to make the market more fair more

00:48:50,050 --> 00:49:00,799
ecologic from the society point of view

00:48:54,319 --> 00:49:02,419
and so if you promote free software and

00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:05,209
especially free software not just

00:49:02,419 --> 00:49:09,679
open-source you allow individuals to

00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:15,019
grow and small companies can compete

00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:17,569
again with large enterprises and still

00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:21,769
the GPL license is the I think the most

00:49:17,569 --> 00:49:24,410
powerful political but also legal tool

00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:26,630
that we have to in create to in to

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:31,910
increase their the the this kind of

00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:34,669
fairness and equity on the market where

00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:38,140
small players again can become rich can

00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:40,329
go through that hope of developing

00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:44,599
different software in a different way

00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:46,369
and of course be aware of one thing in

00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:48,529
the open-source word there is a lot of

00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:50,599
false friends a lot of people let's say

00:49:48,529 --> 00:49:53,150
we are friend of open source we support

00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:56,390
open source we've even contributed to

00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:58,489
the Linux kernel and they go around and

00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:01,369
organize this kind of that's not just

00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:03,769
all big corporates even in local Belgian

00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:06,289
companies will invite you to hackathons

00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:08,390
where you're supposed to write software

00:50:06,289 --> 00:50:12,969
for their own idea or promote your own

00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:16,099
idea or kind of the know summer camp

00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:19,729
where were you write software for them

00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:23,299
but be careful because licenses are very

00:50:19,729 --> 00:50:25,400
important in in these cases because if

00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:27,769
someone is telling you to develop

00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,349
open-source software you just need to go

00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:32,900
one step further and say is this also

00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:36,789
free software because if it is not I'm

00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,789
basically improving your own proprietary

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:44,569
services that you mmm that you do with

00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:47,689
my open source software so I'm not

00:50:44,569 --> 00:50:50,029
against it I'm just saying if you think

00:50:47,689 --> 00:50:53,179
I'm good just pay me because developers

00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:55,189
need to eat as well right so even if

00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:57,289
people ask you to write open source

00:50:55,189 --> 00:50:58,969
software that's not something that came

00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:02,049
from yourself but from your own

00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:04,789
community just please ask for money

00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:07,910
because it's not acceptable that big

00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:11,020
companies get cheap labor and

00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:14,330
and yeah beware of marketing especially

00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:18,380
big news titles because big companies

00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:20,990
normally pay the press to to put their

00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:24,560
the best technology in the in there in

00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:27,710
the first page but it's it's not that

00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:32,060
bad I mean you can build your own career

00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:35,240
on open source software of course you

00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,920
need to be ready to sacrifice some of

00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,010
some parts of your life like sleeping

00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,150
that's not something you're gonna do

00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:43,520
because especially if you have like

00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:45,140
full-time work or your student and

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,780
you're very busy with your with your

00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:51,710
schedule and you do other things in your

00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:53,630
life you'll have to to find some some

00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:58,340
time for your hobbies but that's for

00:51:53,630 --> 00:52:01,580
everything of course and but if you have

00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:03,490
the occur mentality and everyone a

00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:06,710
little bit has it I think it just

00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:10,490
depends on how much you develop it and

00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:12,590
in your in your younger years if you

00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:15,470
want to know how things actually work

00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:19,130
and if you're interested in the tearing

00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:22,010
them apart studying them and putting

00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:25,040
them back with new features or defects

00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:27,410
fixed etc then you should really

00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,930
consider to become a free and open

00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:32,900
source developer outside the fact of

00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:37,070
this is that if you write good software

00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:39,320
and you're passionate about it at some

00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:41,960
point your software the software will

00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,820
become part of your CV so the good

00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:48,340
companies that hire good software

00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:51,380
developers will check your github page

00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:53,720
to see if you actually can write

00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,880
software can if you're able to solve

00:52:53,720 --> 00:53:00,710
problems that you had in the past

00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:04,040
etc so just put some some time in it

00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:06,200
it's not just lost but if you if you

00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,410
actually believe in the project it will

00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:12,770
come come back it will it will come back

00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:15,710
in the form of profit for yourself as a

00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:17,840
professional software developer and of

00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:21,090
course one thing that you need to

00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:24,330
absolutely do absolutely is

00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:27,000
coming to force them because for them

00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:30,020
it's is more than just a conference it's

00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,840
just celebrating the beauty of our

00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:38,220
magnificent community of more than 7,000

00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:40,650
the hackers because they like to to wear

00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:45,270
funny t-shirts where they say that they

00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:48,240
they believe in these attic points that

00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:51,360
that would be true and of course we have

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,870
a lot of other things we are beer we

00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:58,980
have a week of talks just concentrated

00:53:54,870 --> 00:54:01,530
in in in just a single weekend that's

00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,660
that's the best definition I've got from

00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:08,550
frozen was from a from a tweet from that

00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:11,640
guy exactly this year and we have beer

00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:13,770
who have communities that meet up

00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:16,830
especially on possum there's people that

00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:18,870
you can only meet at FOSDEM so there is

00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:23,400
open source there is P softer and this

00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:25,320
beer did I mention there is beer and so

00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,930
I'll see you in February at FOSDEM

00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:32,040
but meanwhile I don't know I probably

00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:33,660
got really tight with the time but if

00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,490
you have questions or things that you

00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:38,310
want to discuss with me I'll leave you

00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:39,870
this this is my contact so you you can

00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,730
actually confront me on the things I

00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,120
said and if there is something that you

00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:44,130
don't like

00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:48,060
especially please let's start the

00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:51,900
conversation about it and I'm even going

00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:55,110
to to publish these slides with very

00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:58,320
clever comments so someone wants to add

00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:59,100
things or hate me for a specific thing I

00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,430
put in there

00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:04,860
I'm just open to everything so yes thank

00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:07,020
you very much and thanks a lot for your

00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,240
time I hope that it was not so too

00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:12,260
boring and you actually got something

00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,260
from this thank you

00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,210
you

00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:26,599
