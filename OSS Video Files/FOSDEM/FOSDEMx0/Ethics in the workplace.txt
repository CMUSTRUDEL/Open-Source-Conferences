hello again everyone thank thanks for

00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,630
staying for the last talk of the day so

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,779
in this talk I'll talk about everything

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,610
that touch ethics in the workplace so I

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:27,890
don't know how many of you are still

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:35,160
students no students anymore that's

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:37,710
interesting okay so like the subtitle of

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:45,510
the talk was all the things I wish I

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:47,969
knew when I still was a student so I'm

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,890
Eric I'm the founder of a software

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,809
consulting company and you can find me

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:57,089
at Eric as me on Twitter github so I've

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,760
been a consultant for 13 years now and

00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:01,019
I'm getting any younger

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,479
including five as an employee that's

00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,659
important I've worked in a lot of

00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:10,230
different industries and I receive now

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,060
I'm the boss of the company I received

00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,780
an average of 20 applications per month

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,810
so what's going to follow is from my

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,880
personal experience and things I've

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,760
witnessed myself it's not a scientific

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,440
study about ethical behavior in the

00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,200
workplace so you should make your own

00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:35,070
opinion so what brought you in IT first

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:38,220
maybe it was maybe it was like he wanted

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,840
to earn more money or maybe you wanted

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,450
you played with computers when you were

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,970
kids with your parents or maybe you were

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,730
fascinated by all this blinking screen

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:53,610
so all of us came for a reason in the

00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:56,400
first place usually ethics is quite of

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,090
an overlooked field when you try to get

00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,940
into IT

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,560
sowhat's ethics it takes it's the study

00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:06,930
of the principle relating to the right

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:11,910
and wrong conduct or morality what's

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:16,560
about saying in IT careers in 2018 so

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:18,420
you can either after you graduated work

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,690
for a product company say

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,720
Spotify or github or whatever usually

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:28,800
the pros include like you will know one

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,290
product in depth you will find some kind

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,410
of team spirit centered around the

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:37,920
product you'll get into interesting and

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,590
niche issues and sometimes you will be

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,600
able to contribute back to open-source

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,180
software the cons in are that usually it

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,550
involves maintaining the same product

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,190
for some time which is a bit less sexy

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,269
than just creating new features all the

00:02:53,190 --> 00:03:01,250
time you also get commercial pressure

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:03,360
your success as like in this business

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,600
depends on the success of your product

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,549
and sometimes it's unforunately

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,769
unfortunately also depending on the

00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,959
marketing around this so you might even

00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,030
build a good product but not get any

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,110
success because the marketing is done

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:22,410
poorly you may also choose to enter

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:25,430
cooperation where the bigger the company

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,440
the lower the expectations so if you're

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,400
not the best students in the class you

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,950
still have some openings in large

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,340
companies you will get a lot of

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,810
diversity because yeah these large

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,430
companies are like getting a lot of

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,109
applicants from very different origins

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,019
so you might meet people that you

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:52,980
wouldn't be able to meet outside of the

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,959
year of your job usually money is a key

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,980
factor in working for corporations as

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,650
well as job security on the other hand

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,280
there's a lot of bureaucracy involves

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,100
you need to be ready to face some

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,130
political pressure from like different

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,620
teams or different departments and so on

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,510
you get often arbitrary management

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,930
pressure like this has to be done by

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,139
Monday

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,090
why Monday because and it's pretty

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,340
difficult to identify success or goals

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:27,030
because you're such in such big

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,530
structure that identifying really like

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,970
am i successful even if you're

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,400
successful at your scale are you

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,580
bringing value to your company

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,290
a bit complicated to know what's your

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,630
influence on the global success of the

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:45,090
corporation you can also go and for a

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,860
large consulting firms there are many on

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,009
the marketplace on the market these days

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,000
usually money is the main factor they

00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:56,729
will literally pour money over your head

00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,780
give you cars and you get to see a lot

00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:03,020
of land or you get to see it get

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,660
introduced to many different industries

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:09,810
on the other hand it's basically the

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:13,199
equivalent of modern slavery on all

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,389
sense that it can bear the turnover are

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,220
usually high because people will get

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,250
quickly upset with their working

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,590
conditions there is usually a low

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,660
technical competency within the company

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,330
because usually when you are getting

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,530
good enough in the on the technical

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:34,039
field then you realize that yeah you're

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:36,750
basically being enslaved and then most

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,389
successful engineers leave the company

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,340
pretty early so you just remaining with

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,550
the ones who haven't yet figured out

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,500
that they were good and usually either

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,180
you get out broken of this like in

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,120
depression and you want just to raise

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,729
sheeps in the South of France or you

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,520
just get a mercenary you embrace the

00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:00,030
fact that money is the center of

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:04,020
everything and yeah that's not the most

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,820
ethical outcome you can also work for

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,610
non software company but still doing

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,830
software development then you're part of

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,220
a greater scheme let's say like you work

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:17,370
for a printer or you work for like an

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,620
editor of magazines there you're part of

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,949
something else you get a short feedback

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,099
loop because you're usually working in

00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:27,810
straight collaboration with your

00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:31,349
co-workers which come from different

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:35,699
fields usually teams are smaller but the

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:38,099
turnover is also lower on the other hand

00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,650
you're competing for the same race for

00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:42,840
the same resources I mean money with the

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,020
other activities of the company so yeah

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,780
it may be if you work at

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,400
like a newspaper maybe the printing

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:53,240
Department needs more money and so it's

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:57,319
being sucked out of IT and unfortunately

00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,699
the in-house IT ways are not always

00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,830
consistent with the industry standards

00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:08,240
or you can do freelancing for anything

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:11,139
it has one big advantage its money on

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,060
the other hand you get a lot of

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:16,490
interesting side effects like legal

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:20,389
responsibility the duty of ensuring

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:23,210
marketing sales all the tax and stuff

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,860
and you get a direct competition because

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:29,780
as a freelancer you're basically

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:33,320
competing as of now with global and I

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:37,400
mean global like at earth scale with an

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:42,740
immense pool of other freelancers which

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:46,610
are as qualified as you are so for

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,810
students planning your career first

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,380
thing you should do is working on

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,960
yourself you should know yourself like

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,300
really think about it find your weak

00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:01,370
spots and really work on them that's

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:07,370
what's going to bring the most the most

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:10,870
benefits be social as join Student

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:14,659
Association or clubs or organize meetups

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:18,680
if you're introvert yeah we are all a

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:22,039
bit of introverts in this field don't

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:25,430
hesitate to be social then also build

00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:27,440
your portfolio there is a very large

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,750
maker in do-it-yourself community

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,010
there's a large open source software

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:35,089
community we are part of or you can also

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,029
try your luck and work for

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:42,289
nongovernmental organizations or charity

00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:44,180
all of this stuff matter in the eye of a

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,540
recruiter because it shows that you're

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:51,640
doing not what you have to do but also

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,640
you're also thinking about others

00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,870
applying for a job

00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:04,420
so you get maybe two different choices

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:06,940
the easy easy one is just falling for

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,280
recruiters usually they have low

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,320
technical knowledge you will spot them

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,380
very easily because the contact you will

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,180
have with them looks a lot like spam the

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,770
mindset behind their activity is usually

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:22,840
they just want to sell the person like

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,560
the engineers as fast as they can and

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:30,400
leave with the money they will always

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,340
fill your resume with buzzwords and pimp

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,530
your qualification without your consent

00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,840
like I've been with a lot of junior

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,930
developers that were labeled as Python

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:46,600
experts and not having ever written a

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:51,750
single line of Python so or you can do

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:55,510
your own self self search Twitter

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:58,780
Linkedin monster indeed or even hacker

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:03,520
news yes you need to do it yourself but

00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:05,350
you'll get a lot more accurate results

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,810
from there and at least you're in

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:13,960
control of what's happening so what

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:17,650
recruiters are looking for in a CV or at

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,870
least what I'm looking for in a CV if

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,350
you're not joining a cover letter so

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,790
some people will tell you yet it's very

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,210
old-fashioned to put a cover letter but

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,480
for me no cover letter means spam it

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,610
means like this person is really going

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,890
for the quantity and not for not picking

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,900
which company wants to work for so I

00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,210
know I've been there too I have also

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,880
applied for jobs so I know it's pretty

00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:46,690
tempting to go harvest a bunch of

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,380
companies that's basically do IT and

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:54,720
just spray your resumes there but me as

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:57,220
an employer I don't see why should I

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,130
why should I go for this person that's

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,070
not even saying I want to work with you

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:07,000
I just want to work okay but it's not

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,410
very tempting for me I don't care if

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,750
it's a

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,550
I don't care if it's within the email I

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:17,320
even prefer because that's two clicks

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:19,210
less for me to read your motivation it's

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,480
a bit cheating to start your

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,550
motivational by your company like it's a

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,240
bit better if it's a bit more customized

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,010
and even bonus points if you're just

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,780
saying me oh yeah I liked a lot this

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,540
project that you did because it matches

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,580
like my master teases or it matches what

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,960
I've done here or like that's very

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:45,340
important for me I'm also interested in

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,890
your character so pictures yeah it's not

00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,140
required but it helps putting a face on

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,390
name because when I'm going through like

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,460
all the CVS sometimes I really I had

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,560
this guy it's easier for me to remember

00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,000
a CV which has a picture but definitely

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,210
I know some people are not comfortable

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,330
with putting as our picture because of

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,460
discrimination I go on there later so I

00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:10,210
completely understand it's just like

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:13,180
it's easier for me and if you have a

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,230
very common name please include a link

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:19,240
to your own online persona so I if I

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,640
google your name I'm not going to find

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,180
50 different guys wearing the same name

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:28,690
and some which might have like less

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,280
respectable online persona like if you

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,290
have a github which is pretty good and

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,960
then the guy which has the same name as

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,480
you do but hasn't also a github which is

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,250
pretty bad I just don't need I don't

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,590
want to have to pick which one am I

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:47,160
gonna going to hire spelling if unsure

00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:51,010
applying in English at least in Belgium

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:55,800
if you have you have just one shot so

00:12:51,010 --> 00:13:00,090
check spelling and grammar twice please

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:02,590
of course technical skills be honnest

00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:06,310
really because it shows during the

00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:08,470
interviews only lists if it's a

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,650
professional proficiency like I've

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,750
opened once a Python interpreter is not

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:17,460
like I am qualified in Python

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:20,980
also avoid buzzwords because it smells

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,030
and you can break a requirement like

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,570
okay you

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:29,050
need let's say two years of practice of

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:33,220
Python okay I just did one year but I've

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:36,010
written this huge library it's actually

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,720
a plus like you you don't have you

00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,870
didn't spend too long with the language

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,360
but you achieved a lot so that's if you

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,610
can justify why you didn't fulfill our

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:55,650
requirements it's always something that

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:58,390
I am careful about job interviews it's

00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:03,130
it's a very common issue to face

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:07,660
discrimination so I'm white young male

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:11,020
so I did not felt discrimination when I

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,330
was interviewed but I know a lot of

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,790
people who have been discriminated

00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,220
because of the gender or perceived

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,290
sexual preferences or family situation

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,870
or the fact they have children you must

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:27,430
know that is absolutely forbidden by law

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:29,400
so here is the link you use so the Felix

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:33,700
one is the link for the Federation that

00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:37,720
takes care especially of discrimination

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,370
against gender and family if you've been

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,220
discriminated for different other

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:45,400
reasons being skin colour place of birth

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,530
cultural background or handicap Union is

00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,160
also an association that's taking care

00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:57,210
of fighting against discrimination for

00:14:51,160 --> 00:15:00,280
those reasons job interview is how to

00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:04,180
attend job interviews be relaxed

00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,930
seriously I meet a lot of candidates are

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,310
very stressed under term interview

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:12,130
usually people are not going to be in to

00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:14,140
bite you it's only a job you're not

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,970
playing your whole life every time you

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:21,160
apply for a job just smile and remember

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,710
why what you replied at my first slide

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,640
like when I was asking what brought you

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:29,170
in ID first feel okay to say I'm not

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,010
comfortable with discussing this topic

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:35,860
because sometimes recruiters try to trap

00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:38,670
you or something it's okay to say

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,930
I don't want to go on that ground and

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,829
examine while you're being interviewed

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:46,540
how the interview and how they value the

00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:49,779
candidates they have because in this

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,670
situation you are also evaluating the

00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:57,279
company it's not on what it's not a

00:15:51,670 --> 00:16:01,000
one-way one-way street sometimes you

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:03,550
find people who think it's that makes

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,220
sense to spend a lot of time doing Mensa

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:09,459
test or logic puzzles or white board

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:12,339
coding or having you answer multiple

00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:14,260
choice question you just have to

00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,540
understand that it's easier for them to

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,750
screen for candidates because they can

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,970
dispatch a lot more candidates rather

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,870
than having a one-hour chat with all of

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:29,339
them and trying to find eleven questions

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:32,500
against it's always a matter of quantity

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,600
versus quality of candidates if there

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,089
are if you do good screening beforehand

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,070
or if you have sufficient capacity to

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:42,190
screen your candidates you might not

00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:45,760
need to do those tests those tests they

00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:48,670
only capture your fitness to imaginary

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,010
model that these people think is the

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,500
kind of employee they want to hire it's

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,959
not your it's not representative or your

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,120
actual abilities again it's failing them

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:03,339
is perfectly okay you're not a bad

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:08,079
person for failing minutes at tests now

00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:11,049
once you have the job sometimes you'll

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,780
hear stuff like yeah we only work with

00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:16,089
long-term freelancers there is no such

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,850
thing as long-term freelancer you won't

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:22,059
get job security you will have a lower

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:24,069
legal protection but they will waive

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:27,880
money in front of your nose don't fall

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:30,700
for it it's not worth it the

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:35,049
bait-and-switch yeah you will receive

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:37,540
internal training or more sneaky you

00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:40,179
will be coding on your next project but

00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,990
for now we need you to spend time as an

00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:47,620
initiative assistant for a few months

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:49,870
turns out never happens the salary scam

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,500
yeah we you will start with two

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:56,020
once internship of course not paid or oh

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,320
yeah yeah we don't pay overtime yeah you

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,660
have to pay overtime it starts or yeah I

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,730
know the salary is low but we will give

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:10,120
you shares of the company which ends up

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:13,480
not showing up ever the golden handcuffs

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,520
yeah surprisingly you get at a company

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,950
which has the salaries twice with the

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,370
competitors offers there's a lot of paid

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,400
holidays free food video games luxury

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:27,250
company cars and stock options why would

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,710
you want to leave even if the company

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:32,200
turns out being very toxic or I'm not

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:37,390
saying this is the case but I mean these

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:40,350
are very strong retention maneuvers you

00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,700
might want question why is the company

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,670
like what are the real motivations

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:49,980
behind a company offering that much to

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,980
employees what are they afraid of

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:58,929
harassment is something which is pretty

00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:01,210
sensitive topic so the pretty obvious

00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,970
personal attacks on origin religion

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:08,800
culture language in Belgium here it's

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:10,990
pretty common for to have objections

00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,250
about people not speaking Dutch or

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:16,540
French or German or English or whatever

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:19,120
personal attacks on physical condition

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,640
nor physical shape or perceived

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,650
intellectual abilities having

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,650
inappropriate language or gesture or

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:30,280
just basically asking out people so this

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:33,100
is not okay harassment is never okay you

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,650
just contact your HR manager self person

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,260
immediately and you don't try to explain

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:43,240
yeah but this person did this no there's

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:45,610
no excuse for that behavior abuse

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,350
blatant abuse take your laptop with you

00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,870
on vacation in case we need you

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,000
vacations are made for taking vacation

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,179
and resting out of the work out of work

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,050
if you're on slack on the beach then

00:19:55,179 --> 00:20:01,840
this is abuse like some people find it's

00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:03,549
hard to disconnect but like if it's a

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,389
business rates if it's

00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:08,649
a manager requirement this is abuse

00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:10,179
since we provide you with the phone you

00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:12,869
should be reachable at all time

00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:19,149
he'll know please dress more feminine

00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:23,619
for ladies no this is again abused it's

00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:26,820
not it's not necessary for your work to

00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:26,820
dress in a way or another

00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:34,480
analytical behavior sometimes you might

00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:37,779
work for let's say a car manufacturer

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,489
that will ask you to game code that

00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:43,179
would conceal soot emissions in your

00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:44,559
cars that's pretty and sickle stealing

00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:47,230
and selling personal information

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:51,009
collected by will say running a social

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:55,389
network reading customer private

00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:57,489
messages not working to fasts as a

00:20:55,389 --> 00:21:00,879
mission last longer which is a common

00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:03,489
attitude in in consulting companies or

00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:07,480
selling a necessary software to knife

00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:09,909
customers like yeah we you have this

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,440
piece of software but you should

00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:13,929
definitely have that piece of circle

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:19,179
which is very costly but because yeah

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:23,529
you need it a few signs your job is

00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:26,590
killing you the over performer or burn

00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:30,309
out if you hear stuff like yeah you'd

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:33,279
never disappointed us so far or you're

00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:35,470
really or any hope if you are feeling

00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,499
oppressed or having anxiety or panic

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:42,009
attack then you might be in the

00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:46,509
situation where you're trying to do too

00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:49,330
much in this case remember to delegate

00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:51,279
set clear expectations from people

00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,470
asking you too much and stand for

00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,779
yourself like no working on the weekend

00:21:53,470 --> 00:22:00,659
or you are finishing up things up until

00:21:55,779 --> 00:22:00,659
2:00 in the morning is not healthy

00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:07,779
people asking you oh you took your after

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:10,659
enough at 5 p.m. or everyone will have

00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:13,990
will have to do overtime from now for

00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:16,539
let's save six months this is the sign

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,260
of the death march you're tempted to

00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:20,020
sleep

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:23,250
your desk to save up on commuting time

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,360
and your personal hygiene is time wasted

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:29,920
definitely you're in the Durst March

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,380
mode this is also very unhealthy our

00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,500
time is not a fixed for poor planning

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,930
like proper resource management

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:45,670
expectation management is and schedules

00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:48,340
can always be changed one more beer when

00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:51,730
you start drinking every day and then

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:54,670
maybe one drink after the other or you

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,890
need to drink to relax after work yeah

00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:00,850
why not and you start contemplating

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:04,540
substance abuse and your relative are

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:09,010
being worried for your health then also

00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:12,190
you might be exposed to a healthy amount

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,770
of stress preferably discuss it with

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:18,280
your family doctor just to identify why

00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:22,960
you're feeling that need of relaxing

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:26,170
with a beer or substances the dead end

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,540
like nothing I mean nothing to do for

00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,340
most of the day your supervisor doesn't

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,830
even care if you work or not at your

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,180
desk you might be just watching videos

00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,880
for the whole day and what you would

00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:41,650
care or you start wondering about your

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:45,400
purpose in life then this is either

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:49,210
harassment or your job is just bogus so

00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:53,350
yeah here I would definitely advise for

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:55,420
quitting the job the scapegoat your

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:58,480
globally criticized without any specific

00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:02,340
details you're always working alone on

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:06,100
failing project four by coincidence and

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:09,610
you start yourself and refusing

00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:13,030
to talk to others that's another form of

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:15,610
our åsmund this is a bit complicated so

00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:17,230
you should definitely seek help from HR

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:20,860
or management if you find yourself in

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:23,740
this situation because it's not it they

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,390
might not be aware of that but sometimes

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,390
it's made on purpose to punish people

00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:34,110
don't please don't once you get a job or

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,440
a leading position don't become part of

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,720
the problem some jokes are not funny

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,150
hello

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,799
racial physical sexual jokes are not

00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:48,419
appropriate in a working environment and

00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,039
please think before you speak because

00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:55,590
you might be offending people without

00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:57,870
even realizing it if you hear our are

00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:01,080
being witness of like inappropriate

00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:03,120
behavior and so on it's very acceptable

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,100
to just correct people and say yeah I

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,289
think you're going a bit too far there

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,240
or yeah this is not very nice you should

00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,480
think a bit about what you just said I

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,400
know it sounds like lecturing but please

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,580
don't allow people to just feel like

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:24,120
they're entitled to say or to act this

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:26,429
way entitlement well of course after you

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,730
get your job then you can start being

00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:31,980
picky about yeah we only hire people

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:35,850
with that kind of degrees or we only

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:39,270
hire males or females or whatever or we

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:42,659
only hire people below fifty or forty or

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:45,950
we only hire people from Europe or we

00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:50,250
only hire people who so no this is

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:52,590
entitlement wanderer yourself if those

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,630
rules had been in place when I was hired

00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:58,860
when I was looking myself for a job

00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:02,760
would I have been selected and hired

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:07,710
myself put yourself in other shoes from

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:11,669
time to time be a decent human being

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:13,620
like sentences I I don't hear often

00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:16,409
enough are sorry I was wrong earlier

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,510
like yeah losing an argument it's not

00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:20,929
losing face or anything it's just like

00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:24,210
yeah you can apologize it's okay

00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:26,909
or yeah initially it looked very simple

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:29,700
but am I missing a critical detail

00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:31,530
people are not usually that stupid if

00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,900
you see that someone is making a stupid

00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:35,460
mistake maybe you're missing a key

00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,549
element or maybe you saw something that

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,649
he didn't so usually starting in the

00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:41,700
conversation and say yeah can you please

00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:44,580
explain to me because it

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,830
looks terribly simple you might start an

00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,600
interesting conversation or is there

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,320
something I can to help I can do to help

00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:54,299
you like if someone is like slacking on

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,120
your job or something or late

00:26:54,299 --> 00:27:02,130
turning on assignments yeah how can I

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:05,220
help you do something making money while

00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:08,000
doing open source software so it's kind

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:11,549
of joining the first talk we had today

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,130
yeah so you can have integrators company

00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:16,500
providing support for custom development

00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:23,070
around in existing software which turns

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:27,330
out to be open source you can also get

00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:29,399
commissioned work like being part or

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:32,789
maintaining a large open source project

00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:36,269
you might also receive requests for

00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:42,000
developing new features on an existing

00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:44,370
code base grants so many different types

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,940
of organizations university foundations

00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:50,690
and companies spend research funds to

00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:54,510
finance open source software that feels

00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:57,450
specific needs and especially the mods

00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:02,490

for financing European source work and

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:21,000
she has a ton of IDs and examples of how

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:24,779
you can generate revenue from open

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,010

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,710
end the talk I'm just quoting Charlie

00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:45,190
Chaplin because I think that it's it was

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:47,919
written in 1940 but it still has

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:50,110
an eco now so it's part of the Great

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,640
Dictator speech he says we have

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,340
developed speed but we have shut

00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,960
ourselves in machinery that gives

00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:00,700
abundance has left it in left us in want

00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,690
or knowledge has made us cynical our

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:07,390
cleverness hard and unkind we think too

00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,970
much and feel too little more than

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,919
machinery we need humanity more than

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:15,730
cleverness we need kindness and

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:18,549
gentleness it's not because we are maybe

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:21,030
introverts and we have it easy with the

00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:31,000
machine that we should become machine

00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:32,830
machines ourselves any questions ok

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:40,820
thank you very much
