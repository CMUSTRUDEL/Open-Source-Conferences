our first speaker today is class Freitag

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,630
sorry Grammy I'm you know he's going to

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,250
talk about how Mr dispatching as you can

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,120
see here which as I understood it

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,650
there's a system to men to have several

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,170
scrubbers fought each other I'm very

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,449
interesting and which you guys use and

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:29,910
so please everybody welcome class

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:32,640
fighter thank you hello so yeah my name

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,989
is five and i work for susan in all more

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,629
than ten years and over the time i was a

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:44,480
lot doing a lot of projects in the tools

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:47,730
area that we use it was a auto bild and

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,469
databases be used for stuff to build

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,180
packages and distributions and now i'm

00:00:51,469 --> 00:01:00,390
part of the so-called opensuse boosters

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:02,340
team we try to do activity two to enable

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,460
the community better to work with

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,390
opensuse news opens all the ester as a

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,979
platform for the upstream and projects

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:16,439
activities today I'd like to talk about

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:18,689
herman's hermits is a project I forced

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:24,360
setting up I think three or four years

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:27,810
again ago we use it in the opensuse

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,729
build service because there are problems

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,790
I'd like to talk about in the first in

00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:38,850
the first part of this talk the second

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,619
part of the talk will be tell me the

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,530
solution which is called harbors in this

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,689
case the third part I give you some

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,079
technical details about the system and

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:52,700
in the fall past you are invited to ask

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,700
questions if you have some

00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:00,020
so what's the problem the problem I'm

00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:02,799
talking about problems with emails or

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:07,159
notifications at all so in the beginning

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,229
most of you probably remember that you

00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,739
sent two people send me a quick email

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:16,190
and I can sort it out and do stuff you

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:19,760
can't got important information with

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:23,810
email email was fun it was a new thing

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,730
and you work organization used a lot of

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:31,069
email over the time and it got very very

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:35,390
efficient and then machine started to

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:40,010
send email it's machines i mean stuff

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:42,799
like build systems like bug trackers

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,810
like maybe she should make us and stuff

00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:47,000
like that and i send out emails to you

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,120
it's your package doesn't fold it

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,190
doesn't do it on this and best platform

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,010
it doesn't those for this distribution

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,440
which is three years old and stuff like

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:03,560
that so you end up with it a lot of

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:05,239
emails and all these emails look similar

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,130
you got too much of them you're not

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:11,060
interested in stuff like this one week

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:14,900
ago so with this machine sending email

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:18,230
everything just turns upside down you

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,530
gotta tons of emails you who's important

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,810
information because if you have 1500

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,730
emails in your inbox you're not able to

00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,310
sort out which are really important in

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,650
fiction off it's not fun anymore and

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:36,200
yeah your work organization probably

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:38,030
breaks so

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:44,480
what we were thinking about what's the

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:48,319
possibility to get back control so we

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:52,099
set up hours with the intention to give

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,380
the the decision back to you which

00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:57,230
information you want and rest your don't

00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:01,940
want so don't let that machine the

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:05,480
system the build system the system send

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,370
email to you but you go to harness and

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,730
say I'm interested in this particular

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:13,250
message from the build system so it's

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,930
not anymore longer that you got 10

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,620
minutes from the build system because

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:22,070
one of your package fails it's because

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,350
its phase in 10 different distributions

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,550
that invite you are only interested in

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,979
one at this one so the farmers you can

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:36,110
configure very detailed which

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:38,000
informations you want to have so that

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,889
worked in the way that the client system

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,419
in case in the example the build system

00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:48,910
doesn't deliver the message directly to

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:52,220
you as a user but it delivers it is

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:57,800
notification of any went through to the

00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:01,130
home system and you configure and decide

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,669
in harness which notification you are

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,630
interested in and it's a conscious

00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:10,150
decision

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:12,010
you don't get flooded with unwanted

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,260
stuff that you decide consciously with

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,900
what we want to have the messages of

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:20,010
course kept in a system which thoughts

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:24,100
it securely entered its predictable and

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:28,360
see able to see visible which messages

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:31,090
were sent out and also the message

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:35,350
itself is configurable by the admin

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:38,020
Bahamas admin and yourself so you can

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:43,000
decide how the message should look like

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:45,010
because the the style of the message is

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,730
no longer part of the implementation of

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:51,420
the of the build system which simply

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,280
dancer text files were too too saintly

00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:59,320
but it's part of the enormous system bio

00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:05,740
network configuration tool tool to

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:08,680
configure it it as you need it we had

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,190
various deliveries also I'm talking here

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:17,350
about mail alodia other deliveries such

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:19,930
as ours SPS or jabber or Twitter ring

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:22,810
which is the interesting because what I

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:26,410
said up recently was that the opens was

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,870
a build service no filter a Twitter

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:32,140
channel with information about package

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,510
updates in the factory project so of

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:38,550
course not every individual sets up a

00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:41,830
Twitter things that's more general a

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,770
general approach to set up in

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:49,000
interesting sources of information for

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:53,020
people but also as possible as an HTTP

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,890
POST that gives the possibility to to

00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:00,250
send information to other systems like

00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,200
not pull a push approach whenever a

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,990
package quite pronto changes and the

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,600
opensuse builders we can do an HTTP post

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,660
to another system which can do stuff

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,090
with information so this is something

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,240
that goes away from a personal

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:20,910
messaging approach it's more

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,400
interdisciplinary our communication but

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:28,460
there's a red line where you can read

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:33,110
messages and there are tons of other

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:38,220
possibilities which could be implemented

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:40,860
the ideas that every user can pick for

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,410
itself in which way a message should be

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,210
delivered so it's up to the user to

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:51,150
decide if he wants package build failure

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:57,120
messages for example as is RSS feed or

00:07:51,150 --> 00:08:01,250
as a each other notification another

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:06,090
features are I just this isn't an

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:10,970
example for an example may let us end up

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:16,560
Bahamas for I think it's an ugly request

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:20,789
in the village service so the actual

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,660
information is this this part this is

00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:27,410
just a creature and for some researchers

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,120
you can use you who get a lot of these

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,760
messages which I set a little bit of

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,930
information and you get them every two

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,390
minutes hope what I testing means is you

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,700
can combine them you tell how much

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,459
please don't send this kind of message

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,980
every two minutes to me but collect them

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:50,220
and send them hourly digest for example

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:54,120
and then all the interesting parts are

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:57,029
collected together combined with the

00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:02,670
header and footer and then its end all

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:05,940
in on a timely basis so we can send the

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,240
digesters once a minute hourly daily or

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,240
weekly

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:22,030
let's come to some technical details are

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:25,360
missed consists of four or parts at the

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:33,670
moment for important part mrs. Harmon

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:36,250
Ava it's a vet vet server-based little

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,890
script and receive the notification from

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:42,700
the clients for example of the hood

00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:45,880
system the generator which connected the

00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,800
incoming notifications and receivers the

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,520
broker which actually sends out messages

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,610
and starships contribution and user

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:59,620
event application so what why did we

00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:03,430
split that up we thought it over with

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,180
one big tool that did most of the stuff

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:09,340
they turned all that for example the

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,740
actual standing of the messages takes

00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,630
too long text iron and sometimes that

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:17,830
very issues stuff like that so it's

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:21,520
better it runs isolated the same is for

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:25,980
the for the web applications will be

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:29,650
amazed up which is better isolated and

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,180
yeah well in the future they could for

00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:34,750
example combined herman aiden starr

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:41,320
should begin much fits nothing really

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:44,020
important as a data storage we use my

00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:48,190
square database at the moment with a

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:50,170
pretty optimized schema over time it of

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,860
course is most of you might have noticed

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:56,320
you have to pay attention to the

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,760
database schema if you want

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:04,270
performance and reliability so this is

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,820
most of their I think most of the

00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:11,830
attention babe into the database t mind

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:19,150
all the applications work on the

00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:21,640
database it's pretty um performant let's

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:24,670
take a deeper look into each of them

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,840
they dominated things go see GI

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:32,170
application-based script advance on

00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:37,060
lightly or Apache I think maybe run it a

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:39,640
light moment on the food service the

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:44,560
client interface is nothing in butter

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:48,580
and water where the clients for example

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,340
the builders can post notification and

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:55,030
the notification is basically just a

00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,950
string so one string identified the kind

00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,600
of information that the kind of

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,520
notification that is happening for

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:06,250
example package build fail this is a

00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,990
complete notification and because you

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,480
need more information about this event

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,940
for example the package name the

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:18,040
platform the architecture of what else

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:22,720
and this can come you know you know all

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:25,450
this comes is as key value pairs as much

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,140
as you want and the system works that

00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,010
way that you don't have to set up

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,760
notification types of stuff you just

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:38,640
send them once and then itself and after

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:42,550
that since your client or often or yeah

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:45,670
frequently st. the same notification

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,440
type its they come in more and more

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,400
messages from the same types of just

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,980
send one and it's down- there's an admin

00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,850
interface their stuff can be

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,850
administered

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:05,310
the notification type the stream that

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:07,930
identifies the only early quiet parmita

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:10,750
together with Dominator comes in an

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,000
Edgar interface where you can see you

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:17,050
which witch notification players were

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,230
set up by just sending them in and also

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,270
as an admin can administer the text

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:28,060
template that is sent out for males and

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:31,480
four for the other things this is some

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:34,300
topical publicly available under notify

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:39,610
open schools in a lock but you have to

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:43,330
11 admin account of course the generator

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:45,480
is just a positive that connect incoming

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:49,660
notification to the subscriptions

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,660
subscriptions are people have to

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,970
subscribe to to the notification so you

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,850
have to say I'm interested in package

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:01,079
base or I am interested in future

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:03,550
changes or I'm interested in whatever

00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:05,470
this is quite a subscription so the

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,360
connection between a message type or

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,670
notification type and the user as a

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,270
subscription and with the subscription

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:17,260
also stayed on in which way you want to

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:19,540
receive the message and when if you

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:23,970
wanted immediately or if it should come

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,970
as a as a digest thing

00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:37,380
the worker is a person that actually

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,630
sends all the messages it doesnae

00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:43,050
sending connect to sue said made sense

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:48,300
at all or that the RSS stuff and

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:50,370
twittering this kind of things jabber it

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:54,360
runs in an infinite loop on on the

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:58,860
server with of course this is braid so

00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:03,540
that it doesn't cause too much load on

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:07,820
machine and whenever something gets

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,820
generated from the generator it sent out

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:16,530
Stassi is the Ruby on Rails application

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,210
at the Hellmouth user interface for

00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:21,060
users where you maintain your

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:24,210
subscriptions where you can read actual

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,400
messages where you can configure RSS

00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:30,720
feeds you you want to see you want to

00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:34,470
fill with your messages it has in user

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,440
mode which is pretty simple is set up as

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,870
an abstraction layer and people just can

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,110
say I'm interested in future changes for

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,400
example and in the background the

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,250
subscription with subscription filters

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,040
and some more more complexed office is

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:54,690
set up for the people and if you want to

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:57,080
go one step ii beyond and look into the

00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:01,260
details you can go to the expert

00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:09,000
interface and set up stuff more in

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:10,820
detail again overview diagram here is

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,450
how I mean ADA which is just a

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:18,330
server-based verification the client

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:21,620
system post the wall notifications in

00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:25,020
there they are stored in the

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:32,430
notifications and parameters tables in

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:35,390
the database the generator we can be

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,530
checks if there are new war

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:41,060
notifications and combines it with the

00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,060
subscriptions and the filters and

00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,600
generate the mess

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,040
that should go out to the people based

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,430
on the settings here and the

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,399
subscriptions the the messages are

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,589
stored in this part of the database and

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,470
the work of all the time Jake is there

00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:02,959
something in and sent it out is melo RSS

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:05,670
and starship is ticking this is editing

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:10,760
subscriptions and the filters and you

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,760
can read messages in queue starts so on

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:22,439
yeah so far how responds in production

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:26,480
for for opensuse project for OBS and

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:29,220
open fate currently we are filling up

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:35,220
and connect more and more stuff to it

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:36,929
since we have no fix for the stuff that

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,480
comes in the beginning so when you start

00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:44,850
over with such a project run into a lot

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:50,190
of any problems current media processing

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:53,550
more than 50,000 modifications a day of

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:56,580
course as stuff like clean up skirts and

00:17:53,550 --> 00:18:02,850
the paper on which we can clean up the

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:06,480
database and do stuff like that there's

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:10,500
a project page in the conclusive icky if

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,510
you are interested and it's free

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,710
software of course it's independent from

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:20,820
the azusa builds over so you can none

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:22,920
hermes for any other purpose and then

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,780
the opens was a good source it is not

00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,040
connected it's not using the build

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:31,410
service code base or something so it's

00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:36,900
just search independent project but of

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:40,820
course it's it's developed along the

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,820
build server so it's yeah

00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:58,279
so I'm finished I'm probably we have

00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:58,279
plenty of time left I'll any questions

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:14,999
no it's just an HTTP post so you need

00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:18,539
you need an HTTP connection between the

00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:23,129
client and denominator and of course you

00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:25,409
have to make sure that that you do your

00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:30,029
network configuration right because

00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:32,039
otherwise if you for example open up

00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:35,940
your hamon 80 to the Internet you of

00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:38,249
course the perfect memory because people

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,169
could send notifications and if

00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:43,109
everything is set up accordingly how

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:47,070
much would send what messages so you

00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:49,399
have to be careful sir my example

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,749
hundred for the losers stuff we have

00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:54,599
it's configured that way that only

00:19:51,749 --> 00:20:01,710
internal network can can reach the oven

00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:06,479
80 on the client systems you can either

00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:08,549
use a prosperous for whiten and not

00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:11,909
approach script perl modules that

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:15,239
provides on one function to send out on

00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:18,659
a notification i think it takes as

00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:21,299
parameters the notification name or as

00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:25,739
the string and then hash reference which

00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:28,919
which contains the power meters so if

00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:30,260
you if you use other languages you will

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:36,170
have to implement

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:42,040
HTTP POST which is easy for most systems

00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:42,040
I guess other questions

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:50,480
okay all right then take a no not so fun

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,480
