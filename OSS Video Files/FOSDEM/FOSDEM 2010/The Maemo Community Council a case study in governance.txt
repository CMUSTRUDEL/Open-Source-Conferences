00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,180
community managing of organizing the

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:59,059
community effort around documentation

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:06,049

my mo community council elections okay

00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,799
one lesson that anybody who here who's

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,220
ever been to a technical conference

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:25,009
knows there are always problems with

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:32,220
linux on oh is that what happened okay

00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:36,320
mirror screens apply keep this

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:41,219
configuration close thank you very much

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,929
good call okay

00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:47,909
so today I'm going to present to you at

00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,909
the mo community council which hello I

00:01:49,380 --> 00:02:01,390
don't think so is that you yeah I

00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:03,179
sounded okay so today I'm going to

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,049
present you the momo community council

00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:06,630
it's going to be weird wearing this

00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:08,709
without any amplification that's okay

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:14,739
which i think is an interesting case

00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:17,890
study of how one company has and they

00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:21,099
try to enable an independent community

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,519
to empower itself and and take some some

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,140
more control of the project from from

00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,510
from the company that initially

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,390
sponsored the project so let's start off

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,769
with the problem statement what problem

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,920
was the my more community trying to

00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:37,810
solve was the my mo community council

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,290
trying to solve and basically what

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:44,590
you've got is and this is something that

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,870
you see in an in an awful lot of company

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,250
run communities or company sponsored

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,069
communities is that you've got your

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,200
company down here that's kind of one

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:55,750
entity and yet there are six thousand

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,370
people in it and then you've got the

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:02,130
community which is kind of another

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:04,480
entity very little overlap typically and

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,489
again you've got maybe three or four

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,269
thousand voices here and so it's very

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,160
very hard for either side either as of a

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,410
community member looking in from looking

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,410
into nokia or as a nokia employee

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,239
working on my more looking at the

00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:27,130
community to try and and and get a

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:30,519
coherent message coming across what does

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:33,609
the my more community think the mime our

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,959
community can think everything from you

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,900
guys should be doing something more like

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,790
symbian to everything has to be free

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,680
software it can be you know you guys

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,340
need to be if it need to be a phone too

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,489
we need a bigger screen you guys need to

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,109
do a neck top right so there's all this

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,930
divergent opinion in the memo community

00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:54,640
side and again on the Nokia side as an

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,350
employee of Nokia

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,970
do you have the authority to speak for

00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,800
nokia probably not there's going to be

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,390
in incoherent messages coming across

00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,720
from different working groups and

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,000
whatnot and it's very hard to identify

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,560
the person that you should be talking to

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,260
within nokia for a component of the mimo

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,580
software software sack for example and

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,130
so there's a small intersection and

00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,250
there there are kind of many messages

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,650
but no real coherent message coming

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,440
across from either side and so the goal

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:29,430
was to have some kind of a group here

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:36,220
and some kind of a group here that would

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:38,890
condense condense and communicate with

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,690
the mimo community I'm condense and

00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,860
communicate with Nokia and make sure

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,700
that the right connections were being

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:48,460
made now the problem is of course the

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:52,120
communities are very diverse as i said

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:57,550
earlier within the same community you

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:59,380
have one announcement gets made there's

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,560
a specific story that i'm thinking of

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:06,400
where there was an announcement made of

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,060
I think it was when my move 4.1 came out

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,070
the OS 2008 and are always two thousand

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,160
and 8.1 I can't remember exactly the

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,390
version but there was a lot more free

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,680
software in there there were some

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,690
components which had been pariah Terry

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,940
before which were released and there was

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:27,700
one guy there was one kind of group of

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,310
people who were asking why is the

00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,720
contact application proprietary is there

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,130
any business reason for the contact

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,890
application of proprietary which is a

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,630
very reasonable situation to have and

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,910
then a very reasonable opinion to have

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,289
and then there was another group another

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,060
very vocal group with that said well

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:45,850
what nevermind the contact opinion

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,100
everything should be free okay so as a

00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,690
Nokia director as a Nokia manager

00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:54,430
looking in on this community you're

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:56,110
saying okay so we can't do one maybe we

00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,610
can do the other but you know is that

00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,200
going to be enough to please the

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,080
community we're always talking about the

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,370
community this big vacuous cloudy thing

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,110
um so that's the problem

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,110
so how did we go about finding the

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:14,280
solution of having the mimo community

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,410
council well back in linux tag 2008

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,210
there was a brainstorm that the my mode

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,940
the great my mo brainstorm was announced

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:26,229
it was a period of i think two to three

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,699
weeks where ideas were invited things we

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,190
should be doing things that the

00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,600
community should be doing things that

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,320
nokia should be doing to enable the

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,560
community to be more proactive and so on

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,020
and at the end of that brainstorming

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,229
period we had two concrete plans one

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,510
short-term 100 days plan and one longer

00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,310
term which we call the 2010 roadmap

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,500
these are the objectives that the mile

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,660
community has between now and the end of

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,850
the year and the 2010 roadmap you had

00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:58,240
things like enable community

00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,190
distributions a co-production of

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,860
documentation is in there open

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,240
development ensure that nokia developer

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,090
is working on the mobile platform or

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,250
working in the community and in the

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,870
hundred days so kind of bigger hairier

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:14,020
goals but they can be broken down into

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:19,510
stages and 100 days plan included among

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:24,099
other things creating a my morgue

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:25,300
community council and it's important to

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:27,370
underline that this is a community

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,990
initiative it's not something that not

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,139
minooka said we think that you guys

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,580
should have representatives that we talk

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,840
to and that's you know that's all we're

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,760
going to deal with with the community

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,310
this is people from within the community

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:43,680
and all that font is really really bad

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:46,889
choice people from within the community

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,169
not the font the color anyway nevermind

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:52,240
so notably jaffa Laird man and general

00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:55,750
anteas I think that's how he pronounced

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,979
it also known as Andrew flags Simon

00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,380
Pickering and Ryan able those are the

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:01,810
three people that specifically pushed

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,460
the idea said you know we need to be

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,620
sending more coherent message to nokia

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,740
so that they can treat us better so that

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:11,860
they can move further along the line of

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:17,620
what the critical mass of the community

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:19,090
is expected and so as i said it

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,930
important to note that it's it's it's a

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:25,210
community initiative but then

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,670
the issue with all of these kinds of

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,440
initiatives is that the idea is easy to

00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,680
express we want to represent the

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,100
community to Nokia and we want nokia to

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:40,570
to empower the community as a whole

00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:43,810
through their interactions with excuse

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,250
me I have some notes empower the whole

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,880
community through their interactions

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:51,280
with with the council but the devil is

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:56,590
in the details so once the idea came out

00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:59,050
it was there was a lot of detail work to

00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,770
to be decided and that really is where I

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,970
think the lessons are can be learned and

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,500
you can go through that kind of the

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,850
reflection process that we went through

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:13,480
and and how we arrived at the situation

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:16,480
that that we got to in the end so the

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,630
first detail which is very important I

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:24,640
think it's a problem that pretty much

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:26,140
every community has is if you're talking

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,460
about electing a council you're talking

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,900
about elections you're talking about who

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,980
can be a candidate who gets to vote

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,670
you're talking about in some sense

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,730
establishing the notion of citizenship

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:44,050
of belonging to who is a my morgue

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,970
community member and it's you know

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,590
pretty much every community has this

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,410
issue I the genome foundation for

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:53,880
example has voting rights and and their

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:57,490
their system is simply if you are

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,110
proposed by you you propose yourself for

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,970
membership and you give a certain number

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,300
of referees so you're in some sense

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,040
co-opted into the foundation as a member

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,870
that's how you get your vote other

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,610
organizations you pay a bucket load of

00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,900
money that's the way limo foundation

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,690
membership works or the eclipse

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,800
foundation membership works although i

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:20,260
think they now have individual

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:24,400
membership as well do they I don't know

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:26,650
how how does how does how does fedora

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,210
handle this issue do they have for

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,690
fedora elections are there fedora

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,690
elections

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,829
okay so so again that so this is a

00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:53,720
voting system I guess you can repeat

00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:56,600
you're what you're what you're saying so

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,639
in the in the video a coup yeah it's on

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,740
it's okay so in the federal community we

00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,209
have different boats which are according

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,670
to the different parts of the project so

00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:07,009
as other RPM the ambassador's the

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,529
marketing's and oldest board actually

00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:10,879
elected based on the community so any

00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:13,220
people which has an account on the

00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,410
federal system can actually vote for the

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,509
people which are part of the board okay

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,480
so so this is getting an account on the

00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:21,560
Fedora system again this is another

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,410
criteria and this is one that came up in

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,500
my mother org is do we consider anybody

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,819
who has an account on my model org to be

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,040
a member of the community it's something

00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:32,899
that you can do with zero effort it

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,560
requires no implication in the project

00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,360
you can create an account leave it alone

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,790
just to I don't know sign up to a forum

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,990
or something leave it alone forever you

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,250
know send one message leave it alone

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,750
forever and then ten years later you

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,759
still have a vote in the my more

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,589
community council is that the way that

00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:53,930
we want to vote and we had very

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:55,459
definitely two schools of thought in the

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,230
mind more community with regard to this

00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,970
issue there was one school of thought

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,990
that said well we need to make sure that

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:05,750
the my mo council is a group of doers a

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:08,480
group of people who have contributed to

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,540
the my mo project in the past and those

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,230
have shown in some sense there they're

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,879
worth that's not a very good way of

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,519
putting it but you get the idea and then

00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,709
you had the second school of thought

00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,209
which said that well you know isn't that

00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,769
all going to come out in the wash if we

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:27,559
give everybody who has a miami dog

00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:29,779
account this is everybody who has ever

00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,139
expressed an interest in my more if we

00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,699
give them all a vote well then obviously

00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:35,990
the people who are not so cannot so

00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:37,370
implicated in the project or not going

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,420
to vote the people who are very

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,519
implicated in the project you're going

00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,620
to know who's worthwhile who's going to

00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,110
be a good representative or not all

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,149
right i'm so though

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:51,350
I kind of a compromised we had in the

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,490
compromise was to use camera karma now

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,829
for those of you who aren't familiar

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:59,269
with the my morgue community there's a

00:12:54,829 --> 00:13:03,500
concept of Karma is that as you do stuff

00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:06,140
in my mother org you get karma points so

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,640
if you release a product you get karma

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,440
points based on the fact that you

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,820
release a product if the product goes on

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,980
to be popular and gets a good rating

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,360
from the users then your karma goes up

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,070
if you are a member of a number of

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,190
projects a number of sub projects your

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,019
karma goes up if you send me email to a

00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:29,660
mailing list or if you post to to a

00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:32,079
forum your camera goes up and fixing

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,550
bugs in bugzilla is another example of a

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:39,019
kind of thing that gives you karma blog

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:43,130
posts and so on and so over time people

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:46,100
who do stuff tend to have their karma go

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,540
up to a certain level and so we we

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,019
decide that we're going to use karma as

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,790
the criteria for both being a candidate

00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:54,680
an election we said you need a hundred

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,290
karma which meant that there was roughly

00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,410
about 400 people who could be candidates

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:04,060
and to vote you needed 25 caramel which

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:06,550
meant that we were we had a potential a

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,430
potential electorate of I think about

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:11,420
1,800 people for the first election and

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:15,339
indeed for the first election there was

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:18,110
a major issue because the talk forums

00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,670
which is a kind of a sub-project of my

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,100
mode which is very very distinct really

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,290
you had it was it was a site called

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,760
Internet Tablet Talk which was not part

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,949
of my mother dog and you had a whole

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,399
bunch of people who were there giving

00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:33,350
user support helping people out giving

00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:37,250
feedback on the platform and so on but

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:38,660
it was essentially very very isolated

00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,800
from my model dog even the people who

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,089
were on the mailing list didn't know

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,930
what was going to what was going on on

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:46,250
the forum and so on the forum when

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,140
people said well you're going to have an

00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,310
election who are these people going to

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,600
be representing they're not going to be

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,750
representing me because I don't even

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,370
have a vote and so for the first

00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,310
election we gave pretty much anybody who

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,209
had a motor or account a vote and yet we

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,829
kept them at the camera requirement for

00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:06,980
for being a candidate for the elections

00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:09,250
and inset in following elections than

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,300
we've we've we've integrated Karma as

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,760
something that that you get from block

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,260
from from forum posts Isis again this is

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,250
kind of controversial within the MIMO

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:22,010
community because is somebody who does a

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,500
thousand forum posts contributing

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,660
positively to the mo community or not

00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:32,029
and that really depends on what they're

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:33,440
saying so it's a tough problem and this

00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:37,010
is this this is the way we solved it in

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,060
any case some of the other questions

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,699
that we had when we were talking about

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,329
elections was how long is it Tom going

00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:48,260
to be and there you've got the balancing

00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:51,910
act between asking people to commit a

00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:54,050
lot of time and a lot of effort and

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,810
potentially be in being a role for maybe

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,699
a couple of years or you know having

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,170
elections all the time and if you look

00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:04,010
at the timeline of an election from

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,019
counting back from the day that you

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,149
declare the results the day before you

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:10,430
close the votes one week before you open

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:12,589
the votes one week before you close the

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,670
nominations for the election and one

00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:14,810
week before that you open the

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,329
nominations for the election so you've

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,040
got a month from the moment that you

00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:21,920
announce the election day date and open

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,819
the nominations to the elections the

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,589
result being announced so if you've got

00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,630
a month of a process for an election

00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:31,220
process which is I think a reasonably

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,199
short probably i think the genome

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,610
Foundation takes six weeks from the time

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,019
that the election is announced until

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,250
they the results are in if you're

00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,920
holding an election every three months

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,839
then you're always in election mode

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,100
you're never giving your council enough

00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:50,660
time to to actually you know take take

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,790
on the role and take on the mantle of

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:57,589
the community representation that

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:59,240
they're being given so there were a lot

00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:01,010
of other questions to deal with with

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,089
elections as well what's the voting

00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,500
method that you're going to use and I

00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:06,069
know this is one that comes up in every

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,220
single community we did have some

00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:12,110
criteria

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:15,770
that we felt were were important for a

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:18,559
voting method one was that we wanted to

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:21,770
avoid very polarizing characters and my

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,260
mo is a community where you've got two

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,419
divergent some very divergent views and

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,100
there are people who are very very vocal

00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:33,740
who have a very strong following and yet

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,280
don't represent even a significant

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,720
minority of the mammal community so we

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,600
wanted to have an election method which

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,059
was not first-past-the-post our first

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,669
five past the post because that we were

00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:50,000
saying to ourselves in that kind of a

00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:52,909
situation somebody who has fifteen

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,549
percent support of the community will

00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:59,510
get a seat on the election and may be a

00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:02,720
negative influence on them on the the

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:04,340
operation of the council whereas if you

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,960
do something like a proportional

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:11,260
representation or a preference voting if

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,980
that person is first preference for

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,600
fourteen fifteen percent of the

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,520
community and last preference for

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,900
everybody else then the chances are he's

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,210
not going to get the seat on the council

00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,539
so we're avoiding very polarizing

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:26,320
characters and avoiding making the

00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:28,940
council ineffectual by having that

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,409
constant flame war type environment

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,720
going on in the council in council

00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,400
meetings and in council interactions so

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,530
we wanted to avoid that type of that

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,350
type of character we wants to avoid a

00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,570
complicated election system wants to

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:45,770
make sure that it was easy to vote and

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:47,630
that it was easy to understand how your

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:51,500
vote was going to be counted and I was

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:58,250
easy to count votes so I'm easy to

00:18:51,500 --> 00:19:01,820
verify the result so that automatically

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,740
kind of punched Condorcet methods out

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,970
out of the out of the sea we did nobody

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:12,440
understands con Dorset okay two people

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:16,390
understand Condor sir I'm sorry nobody

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,159
really understands con Dorset so so um

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:22,050
yes you can only count Condorcet

00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,850
elections with software base

00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:29,680
it's difficult to count them by hand it

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:32,020
is it is so those those kind of it's

00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,330
fairly serious support within the

00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,240
community for what's called preference

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,040
voting not preference voting

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,220
satisfaction voting so I can't remember

00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,690
the exactly the the name of the voting

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,730
system that was proposed but the idea is

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:50,980
simply that you gave every counter to

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:52,000
score from 0 to 100 and and you figure

00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,920
out you know if somebody if somebody

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,290
yeah you kind of like the guy you might

00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,820
give him a 70 and if you really don't

00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,560
like me to give them a 0 and if you

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,090
really really want this guy to be on the

00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,880
on the on the boards you're going to

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,710
give them 100 and then it all comes out

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,120
in the wash and you get your everybody

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,610
gets their more or less favorite

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,110
candidates but that kind of voting

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:14,500
system is again very difficult to verify

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:16,810
and gives you these really weird results

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,090
where nobody is happy nobody has their

00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,760
favorite choice elected everybody has

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,250
their kind of yeah middle-of-the-road

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,290
candidates elected so the the voting

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:30,430
system we chose was a single

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:32,830
transferable vote with fractional

00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:35,290
transfer volts so the idea is you vote

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,880
one two three four five for your five

00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,380
favorite candidates you can go all the

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,000
way to nine or ten or eleven if there

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,000
are eleven candidates and then votes

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,330
transfer if your favorite candidate gets

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,610
eliminated or elected then your second

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:50,380
favorite candidate will get either the

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,230
whole vote if your favorite candidate is

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,400
eliminated or a part of that vote if

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,440
your favorite candidate is elected and

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,220
there's a surplus to be distributed to

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,870
other people so it's a fairly simple

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:05,610
election system its hand counters in

00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:09,640
places like Ireland and New Zealand mmm

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,870
australia Malta they use that system but

00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,130
without the fractional transfer

00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,380
fractional transfer means that the

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,760
result is reproducible because if you

00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,770
don't use fractional transfer what's

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,230
used in Ireland is what they call random

00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,600
transfer that means that if you have a

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,230
quota of 100 once you get to 100 volts

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,970
you're elected somebody goes to 110

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:30,520
random transfer you will take 10 of the

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:33,340
110 ballots and look at who's the second

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,600
preference randomly and then allocate

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,940
those walls to the sieve to the

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,780
the goals to the other candidates that

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:43,870
are that are second preference so handy

00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,669
system it's useful but it means that if

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,740
you recount an election twice you can

00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:53,049
get two different results which isn't

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:55,299
very which isn't very nice so we chose

00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:58,630
fractional transfer which basically is

00:21:55,299 --> 00:22:03,610
uncountable but it's much easier with

00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:06,520
software okay so that's the for the for

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:10,720
the nitty-gritty of how are the council

00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:13,690
going to get elected and who can be a

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,820
candidate and who can get a vote the

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:21,520
next question the major question is what

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:23,590
are the council going to do and you know

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,870
it's not a straightforward question it's

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:30,480
it's okay now we've got people who to

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:32,890
represent us you know go represent us so

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,750
the council took on some fairly major

00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,280
responsibilities the mission statement

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,490
if you like if the council was to

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,549
distill and focus community ideas to set

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:44,470
priorities for the community to

00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:46,570
represent community mature community

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:50,590
ideas and community community opinions

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:52,450
to Nokia and to communicate official

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,460
Nokia responses to have kind of a in

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,020
some sense of privileged communication

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,630
channel with Nokia and to communicate

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:03,309
those official Nokia responses to the

00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:05,950
community at large so the council works

00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:08,890
closely with Nokia representatives both

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:11,320
technical and community marketing

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:14,140
basically a Kim Gil is is the the

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:18,250
community marketing guy in in in nokia

00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:20,350
and the council works very closely with

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,559
him but the goal of course is to

00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:26,559
encourage Nokia to and nokia employees

00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:29,260
to become a tighter knit part of the my

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,970
mode our community itself right so to

00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:35,140
have nokia developer is developing in a

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:38,950
public gator subversion to have the

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,870
nokia developers be consider themselves

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,850
my mother or community members really

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,909
that's that that's the end goal so this

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,220
is that the community is not only

00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:49,360
communicating with the special milk

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:54,010
representatives that's what I want to

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:57,809
communicate one other responsibilities

00:23:54,010 --> 00:24:02,049
that they took on a fairly major one is

00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:04,390
managing in quotes the motor dog team

00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:07,179
this is one of the things that Nokia did

00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:11,320
very early on in the in the project

00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:13,260
which is I think very novel in turn in

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,960
terms of other community of other

00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:20,260
community corporate projects corporate

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,610
community projects um I don't know how

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,650
you how would you say that corporate

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:27,669
sponsored community projects something

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:30,460
like that they hired people from the

00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:34,690
community to do stuff for the community

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,820
and and no you don't you don't answer to

00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,890
answer to sweep we pay your paycheck but

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,400
you don't answer to us so I'm the first

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,809
guy that they chose was Neils here

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:48,250
that's Berlin so the beer wasn't as good

00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:50,530
as this weekend Niels was hired from the

00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:52,000
community to be the webmaster so to take

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,120
care of my mother org infrastructure

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,890
he's since grown out of that grown even

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,770
further in that role and he's now you

00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:02,890
know developing software taking care of

00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:06,010
the infrastructure and managing in some

00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,929
sense the rest of the team I'm Drake

00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,380
clapper came on board around the same

00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:14,409
time as me that's me um and he's the bug

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,909
master so this is somebody who's making

00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:18,309
sure that bugs that come into my mother

00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:20,080
org bugzilla recruiting a team as well

00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:21,370
obviously from from the community but

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,190
making sure that folks that come into my

00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,840
mother or but bugzilla are triaged point

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,240
that the right person is pointed to them

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,200
and that the bugs are qualified if there

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,520
are duplicates they're marked as

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,530
duplicates very quickly and so on it

00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,820
keeps it keeps the bug database very

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,090
clean and makes it much easier for

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,220
professional developers to work with it

00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:41,890
that this is nokia developers again a

00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,570
lot of them were not community

00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,890
developers before that they were not

00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,900
free software developers so they're kind

00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,210
of still getting used to its way of

00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,220
working having a bug a bug master makes

00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:54,059
that a lot easier and then I was the

00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,770
dockmaster managing documentation and

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,870
doing a lot of event management and

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:02,210
organizing elections and things like

00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,980
that since then we've we've now got a

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,350
Master who I was hoping would be here

00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,390
who helps people from the community with

00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,410
packaging issues helps and package their

00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,140
software and make sure that it's

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:17,480
distributed we've got a disc Master

00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:19,310
Kerin monk who is working on mayor

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,280
working on a community distribution paid

00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,420
by Nokia and we've got a talk master

00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,800
this is somebody who's taking care of

00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,700
the community forums that I mentioned

00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:31,700
earlier and he again is is paid by Nokia

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,070
to maintain and develop the the

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:37,460
community forums so we've got a team now

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:40,000
of six people that the my mother org the

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:43,130
my more community council sorry are

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,490
managing directly setting our priorities

00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:48,170
we meet them every month and review the

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:51,140
tasks we've we've committed to the year

00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:53,810
before that the month before and plan

00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,250
the tasks for the next month and this is

00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,080
a major responsibility so you've gone

00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,640
from being it just a simple community a

00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,040
community member you get elected and all

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,190
of a sudden you're you're a member of a

00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,930
five-person management team right so

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,700
it's it's it's it's been a transitional

00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,140
period but you can imagine what it was

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,350
like before when we were answering to

00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,030
the community you know how does how does

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,480
a community of 3,000 people set

00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:18,830
direction for somebody right so

00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,860
essentially we were just doing whatever

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:24,020
we felt was most necessary and if people

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,100
you know complain too much then we said

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,370
well maybe we should be doing something

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,340
else having the the council there and

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:35,750
having that feedback constantly is

00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:39,470
definitely a big improvement for me and

00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:43,420
even they had hiring responsibilities

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:45,560
when when we heard when Nokia hired

00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,420
Jeremiah to be the dead master our

00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,700
contract to Jeremiah to be the dead

00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,340
master it was the mama dog team that run

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,680
the interviews sent out a job

00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:57,500
announcement decided what the what the

00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,630
the role was going to entail what type

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,820
of person they were looking for and I I

00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,930
helped them with that but but it would

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,690
they were the ones who made the final

00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:08,420
decision here's our choice nokia please

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,910
from this person most companies wouldn't

00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,560
do that kind of thing I think it's a

00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,990
it's admirable that Nokia going in that

00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,080
direction and you know in some sense

00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,240
giving giving a

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,299
group of people that they have

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,740
absolutely no control over

00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:25,230
responsibility over you know significant

00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:30,450
resources in terms of in terms of the

00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:33,750
the financial cost of six employees so

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:36,029
the inaugural council was elected in

00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:39,289
September 2008 that's Berlin again we

00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:39,289
were back there for the my muscle met

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:45,480
five members chairman is elected by the

00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:48,720
council it's a small group so more

00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,909
versatile much easier to get agreement

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,929
but sufficiently large that we reflect

00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:57,419
the diversity of the community and it's

00:28:54,929 --> 00:29:01,950
been a positive experience we've had

00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:03,570
some difficulties for sure some of the

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,510
difficulties have been getting

00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,880
candidates we've had for most of the

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,269
elections there have been between nine

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,320
and twelve candidates so it's the same

00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:15,179
problem i think that the genome

00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,539
foundation has is that people see it as

00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:21,269
a big task which is why we limited the

00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:23,580
why we limited the the term to six

00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:25,230
months because it's something that you

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:31,940
can do for six months and then say okay

00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:35,580
i've i've done my part and pass on we've

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:38,159
had some so let me see what was it oh

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,110
yes the difficulties were the community

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,909
schism I I mentioned with you that for

00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,289
the first election we essentially said

00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:45,090
there's no going to be no camera

00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:46,440
responded camera requirement to vote in

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,570
the election anybody who has on my model

00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,159
or account can do that but then this was

00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,980
a huge flame war that came back for is

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,659
the second election what do you mean i

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,159
need twenty-five camera to be to be able

00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:59,250
to vote I voted in the last election

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,159
right and so we had to have a referendum

00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,659
to settle the issue for once and for all

00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:06,389
we did that on the second election and

00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:09,029
now i think the karma issue is pretty

00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:19,139
much settled karma calculations are

00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:21,120
continually being refined yes sorry say

00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:25,220
there was a referendum to find who's

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:29,159
eligible for voting who was eligible for

00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,910
absolutely circular issue so that was

00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,220
the community

00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:36,060
council that decided and they said okay

00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:40,110
people who have an account before X date

00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:43,170
and have 25 karma get to vote in the

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:46,800
referendum controversial decision

00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:48,360
absolutely so the cam issues and

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,260
basically camera calculation has since

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,630
been been been addressed as well so we

00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,760
have had difficulties but we've had

00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:58,650
significant successes one of them I've

00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,810
mentioned already the council has taken

00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:04,010
on considerable responsibility they've

00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:07,470
hired a member of the community to help

00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:10,770
the community with packaging they've had

00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:12,330
on several occasions confidential

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:14,190
information that's been passed to them

00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,650
without an NDA from Nokia which is

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,510
something that nokia has never done and

00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:20,730
said okay you guys are the mole

00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,290
community council we trust you you know

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,130
we can't tell this to 3,000 people

00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,010
because it's going to be on the front

00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,880
page of newspapers but you know get

00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,400
ready we're going to be releasing

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,890
something next week or this feature is

00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,330
in the next release and we want to start

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,560
having people talking to it who do you

00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,420
suggest we should talk to from the

00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,610
community and so on so the council has

00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,440
really been a figurehead for putting

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,720
engaged community members in connection

00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,920
with the right people within nokia to

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:50,070
make sure that that community

00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:51,780
empowerment is happening um oh we've

00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,070
also we've also taken care of the

00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:57,560
rebranding of the website that was a

00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:59,550
community my more community initiative

00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,200
coordination of the content to the mo

00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:04,290
summit so this is community organized

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,360
summit know for the most part two days

00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:10,170
out of three was completely community

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,990
organized and choosing applications from

00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:14,580
the community to community developed

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,320
applications for special attention so

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,330
that they would be ported to Miami 5 and

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,280
in advance so that there would be some

00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:23,630
funding available to ensure that that

00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:28,080
developers were working on them and

00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:30,360
basically I as I said serving as a

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,910
funnel to make sure that the the best

00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,740
people for attention in the community

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,810
get get that attention from Nokia and

00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,740
we've got a very positive community

00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,740
experience moving forward

00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:48,150
next mon community a council election is

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:51,330
coming up next month and the next and

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,940
the saudi riyal the my more community

00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:59,880
council is the voice of the community

00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:04,440
thank you very much I've left 10 minutes

00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:07,400
for questions so does anybody have any

00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,960
questions yes that it will use the mics

00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,460
quick war zone on the general

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,770
dissatisfaction of the community after

00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,810
everything has been deployed so I mean

00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,700
something that you have been within the

00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,770
community do you think that some there

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,510
are still some people who maybe just

00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:24,080
drop the community because they didn't

00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:27,090
like the way think we're going or just

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,580
showing constant complain it's just

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,350
something that is quite welcome there's

00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,840
you can never please all the people all

00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:36,290
the time and in fact you can never

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,270
please all the people any of the time in

00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:42,360
in the mo community because there are

00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:46,130
people who as I said it's a diverse

00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:49,050
community and there are no there are

00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:51,900
opposite polar opposites in there people

00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,940
are attracted to the device and if

00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,680
you're a device geek then maybe you're

00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,210
not that into free software and people

00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,950
are attracted software platform and if

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,470
you're free software geek then maybe

00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,850
you're not so interested in making

00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:06,660
compromises to have the device work

00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:09,179
magnificently right so there is the we

00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:13,620
want everything open a school of thought

00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:16,830
and there is the this hardware socks

00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:19,320
school of thought I'm here is and there

00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:21,210
is a there are people who complain for

00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,580
everything there is a there are people

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:27,419
who that this is too expensive there are

00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,500
people who will say anything from all of

00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:30,090
the range of complaints that you can

00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,330
possibly imagine about a telephone or

00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:34,919
about an Internet device that we get

00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,149
them all you can't keep everybody happy

00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:38,659
but i think that the overall

00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:41,550
satisfaction level of the community has

00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:44,700
dramatically improved from three years

00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:46,800
ago and if you think of five years ago

00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:50,070
when the when the first my mo release

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,750
came out or five years ago when the

00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,970
nokia 770 came out

00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,470
this was essentially you know it was a

00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:59,310
community project they were working with

00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:02,640
upstream projects within nokia for sure

00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:06,130
but there was essentially no hooks there

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,190
for people to start hacking on the

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,540
software right they did essentially the

00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,620
way that people contributed the moment

00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,630
community was to write my more

00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:18,610
applications there most of the platform

00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:21,670
was not closed because most the platform

00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:30,010
was open but upstream so it was a kind

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:32,740
of a big gelatinous blob right I think

00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:35,860
that's improved because we've made sure

00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:39,100
that the community has has been more

00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:42,370
empowered we've made sure that they feel

00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:44,470
listened to represented I think that

00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:46,960
Nokia developers now understand the

00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:49,300
community better and under starting to

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,920
engage the community more it's a

00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,320
constant process so it's it's like it's

00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,670
a gradient but this has been from if you

00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,400
think of from the from the days of the

00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:04,180
772 now there's absolutely no

00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:05,380
differences light years apart if the

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,990
next bigger wants to come up and set up

00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:16,000
their laptop I'm perfectly happy with

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:19,990
them doing that by the way good are

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,990
there any other questions about the the

00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:24,970
community council in in itself people

00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:28,410
interested in the governance model or

00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:31,990
yeah I'm sorry but I don't really know

00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:34,000
what memo what is the piece of saw were

00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,730
what is the plan for 4 i'm sorry about

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,980
that so it would be if you can just say

00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,510
in two or what it is for i got me to

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,960
understand the kind of people you may be

00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:47,890
facing I'm sorry so my mo is a linux

00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,500
kernel based software platform which is

00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:52,900
installed on devices like this this is a

00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:58,510
phone it doesn't have sim card in right

00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:01,330
now but that one does yeah so it's it's

00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,460
it's a complete software stack so my mo

00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:06,099
is the distribution in some sense which

00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:09,880
is why I guess I'm here

00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:13,239
it's a it's a debian based distribution

00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:17,739
for mobile devices okay perfect of this

00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:20,529
kind of farm fight and what are they I'm

00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:22,690
sorry too I that was more than two words

00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:25,299
by the way yeah and what are they

00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,979
strategic decision that you know the

00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:28,660
console is facing a community facing

00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:30,609
just to have an idea of where are the

00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,579
key Quixote issues that they they either

00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:35,680
the community and the governance system

00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:38,829
that has been put in place are taken by

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,289
now the key hot issues at some of the

00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:43,180
key so that i can i can start having any

00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:45,940
of the what are the kind of pieces that

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:50,109
you have to address well at this point I

00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,519
I did mention that there are some closed

00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:54,849
components there are some flow source

00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:57,880
components in the platform and so it's a

00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:59,499
constant process of getting the things

00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,819
that can be opened opened this so

00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:03,819
obviously they're their partner

00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:07,479
agreements and there are all sorts of

00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:09,190
reasons why things might be closed but

00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:11,079
the idea is that anything that can be

00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:15,309
open should be open and that's it that's

00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:17,739
a constant process ensuring that for

00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:19,749
example documentation is developed in

00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:22,529
the community this is I say

00:38:19,749 --> 00:38:24,609
documentation because my my thing

00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:25,989
ensuring that documentation is written

00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:27,309
in the community rather than behind

00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:29,559
closed doors and then you get a hundred

00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:31,809
pages of docs dumped over the wall

00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:33,059
that's the kind of that's the kind of

00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,769
thing that I'd like to ensure that we're

00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:41,460
so we've for example all of our docs are

00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:41,460
in a wiki almost all of our docs really

00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:49,900
so thank you very much I'm going to be

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:53,880
around all weekend and I will leave the

00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:55,940
stage to the next speaker

00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,940
