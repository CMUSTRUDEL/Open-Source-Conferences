his distributions rule number two we're

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,160
now gonna have a talk on space walk us

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,950
pace walk excuse me Bacchus mother and

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,679
sounder not these by pronouncing their

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,490
names right both are Linux engineers

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:30,869
from Zurich and have development Fedora

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:31,769
project whoo but this is good these guys

00:00:30,869 --> 00:01:01,379
are going to talk about an application

00:00:31,769 --> 00:01:05,580
space ball formations so my name is

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:10,320
mozzarella as I'm working from the ETA

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:13,799
and serve and we are currently actively

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,590
working with spacewalk and satellites

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,040
over spacewalk is between open source

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,520
lifecycle management tool for Linux

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,880
distributions first of all I want to

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,880
give you

00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:57,030
what our technology okay just play space

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,030
so you're gonna talk box around I won't

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,500
want to talk about space walkers

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,049
mentioned because baseball what is

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,530
Facebook space box of the communities

00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:10,810
will I suffer lifecycle management some

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,440
of you may already know what a lifecycle

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,569
anything for this some of you don't I'm

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,930
going to explain the complete lifecycle

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:22,140
management circulator but before that I

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,849
want to show you what baseball is

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,980
spacewalk is upstream from product from

00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,620
wet head this product is called whether

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,739
that word satellites our it's a

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,590
commercial so it was a close

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:38,530
product and webhead which exists for

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:43,750
quite a while and it's established in

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:47,709
pyro of enterprise environments there

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,730
back in 2008 when I decided to make this

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:55,000
product open-source tool whether this

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:57,670
strategy to make nearly all the parts

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,880
there with actively development on open

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:04,930
source so everyone of us can benefit

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,630
from this process so since 2008 a new

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,079
project has been started this project is

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,130
called

00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:12,549
spacewalk so what you may wonder what it

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,160
is

00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm we call it it is one wing for them

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,109
more because you can handle all the

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,060
tasks with that tool so let's take a

00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:25,750
look at the lifecycle management process

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,850
well here ceiling graphic and it shows

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,440
you how it works first of all it's the

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,600
provisioning

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,390
process we're going to explain it as

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:37,380
detail later the machine has to be

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:39,210
equivalent machine has to be managed in

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,760
form of configuration for formal

00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,800
software and the machine has to be

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,160
monitored because you want to know the

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,570
health of industries the non task is to

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,090
be provision or to update existing

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,940
systems in our distributions with five

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,040
short life cycle like to go is and you

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,240
want to find away how to maintain these

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,890
distributions yeah

00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,720
few options one option is to use a

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,400
configuration management tool like

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,530
carpet or something like that

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,890
another option is to use playing fixed

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,260
up files for deploying that and I think

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,970
the best option is to have an integrated

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,970
tool to handle all that town's food

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,990
first of all that was provisioning for

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,990
evening wear that words is kick-starting

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:31,620
a system so all the distributions have

00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,960
our tools for I post I think these steps

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,030
it's called kick-starting it's already

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,060
adapted to I guess it's even possible

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,280
for boots or something like that and we

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,050
have a wizard to create these kickstart

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,100
profiles I'm going to show you that

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:49,560
later in the backend we use cobbler 4pc

00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,780
ultimate ization what we want is to

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,700
deploy a system straight out of the box

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:59,790
what we have of Wady ready to one system

00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,620
which is it automatically integrated

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,100
into the lifecycle management tool and

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,640
works with it fun popular also supports

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,980
slippers snippets are parts within a

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:15,210
kickstart file that can be rendered

00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:17,640
during kickstart proces these snippets

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,700
can contain macros or things like that

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,720
which may contain system information

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,010
individual information which can be used

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,419
later for things like more info

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:31,800
one of the components of published

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:35,430
called cheetah a one space named cheetah

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,490
is a verification tool verifies into

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,220
beef T up here keeps the parts you can

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,180
already upload keeps the files in to

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,570
assist

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,990
you can point and click all the

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:52,200
components that are available in the

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,960
kicks that profiles and come gonna show

00:05:52,200 --> 00:06:02,040
you back later and cheater verifies it

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:04,440
for you so you can really do nothing so

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:08,070
the next part what what happens after

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,320
the evening one really important thing

00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,560
is that you want to make the software on

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:17,700
your sheet you want to join updates for

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:21,480
wet Edwards a lot has inform of updates

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,730
and notification messages you want to

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,920
manage the number of systems not only

00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,470
one you want to select a few systems you

00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,220
want to group systems together and

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:36,210
manage these on one safely or will make

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,010
even shine north and you can do all that

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,080
with a software management component of

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,020
this baseboard server the software

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,730
management component aspects seems like

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:50,100
repositories to so called channels

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:54,690
channels can be subscribed by system so

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:58,730
system can have access to the Associated

00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:01,320
channels and automatically install the

00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:04,260
software that is given in the kickstart

00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:08,370
profile or even later you can do all the

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:12,420
software install for example 100 machine

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,490
with about two or three clicks away one

00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,580
nice feature that most of the components

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:20,130
of spacewalk hair is natural mobile

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,430
functionality so if you do something

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:26,100
wrong or mistake happened while even the

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,890
sips system broke down doing the

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,670
provisioning log management you can

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:35,580
repeat that same thing Peter Hall effect

00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:38,700
so you can always happen will define

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:46,260
state and this state is definitely

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:47,529
reliable the next thing is and that's

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,429
the most controversy

00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:53,399
of the of this space box for the next

00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:56,169
thing is a configuration management

00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:58,269
hours this cache was people who prefer

00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:01,419
our things like pop another even

00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:03,579
cfengine ojala tools space pork has a

00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:06,819
different approach consider concerning

00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:09,879
configuration which wants to keep things

00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:12,849
flat and simple and this is the

00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:16,959
difference it can't be the right tool

00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:19,149
for every case some in some cases puppet

00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:23,559
might be a better choice but in most

00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:26,709
cases this is even morning the files are

00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:28,989
merged controlled so you can simply

00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:32,469
upload a new version for a configuration

00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:35,229
file you can access the history of the

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:38,829
fine can create this we employee via

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:42,309
shell and within the configure a

00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:45,639
configuration files things like Marcos

00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:47,170
can also be used so for example you want

00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:50,680
to deploy our configuration factor the

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,839
hosting set simply act within this

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,439
configuration file the macro for

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,029
hostname or P information and it's

00:08:55,439 --> 00:09:06,009
automatically rendered during employment

00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:09,850
of the configuration file the next thing

00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:11,829
is the what happens if you for example

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,579
deploy a configuration file for your web

00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:18,399
server Pepsi example now you need to be

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:23,980
possibly possibly you need to be started

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:27,939
all reload gracefully the service you

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,740
can do this with remote commands the

00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:33,550
most commands are heaven with spacewalk

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:37,480
with a back-end 400 that users at the

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:39,339
moment Java for communication there's a

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,579
jump communication between the client

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:46,449
may be a proxy which can be set in

00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:48,339
between and the spacewalk server during

00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:50,949
this communication remote commands can

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:54,100
be pushed to the client and then

00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:56,139
executed so you can simply executing

00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,720
remote command after the config file

00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:01,930
deployment that gracefully

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,779
CEO Patrick that's it one less teacher

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,810
simple singing so you can tip took one

00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:10,750
or two of your machines from the group

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,269
and try to deploy change configuration

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:16,329
files to change configuration files to

00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:19,180
these two machines to see how they still

00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:22,839
behave and if they still behave like you

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:24,459
have expected if so you can move the

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,509
files from the sandbox to the wheel

00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:30,839
world conflict management system and try

00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:38,100
to the other bosses

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:40,540
it makes QA quite more easy as in the

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,389
software management even configuration

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:47,610
manager exports national home base so

00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:47,610
you can do not really nothing was

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:57,069
another component of the youth space

00:10:53,439 --> 00:11:00,759
boxer which we will be seen later this

00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:04,029
is a monitoring function with weapons

00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:07,540
has bought few years ago as part of my

00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:11,889
company she left not close not close as

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:14,199
a monitoring solution similar to socials

00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:18,579
like maivia's settings or something like

00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:21,220
that it's not bad powerful but it's

00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:24,100
quite ok you can create growth Suites

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,829
and within these Pope Suites you can

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,980
check the status of your system you can

00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:32,559
create service state polls you can

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:35,350
create positing forms that you can

00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,410
simply go interactive web service still

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:41,740
reachable for point 80 or more for 3

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:46,959
years moving you can also define system

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:49,029
state probes which will tell you for

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,620
example the disk remember we use a Java

00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,480
system

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,329
this thing is shown in graphical output

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,230
so it can rates grass its generate

00:11:55,329 --> 00:12:02,259
reports which can be downloaded and it

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,980
seems we files or something like that it

00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:08,230
has an integrated locking functionality

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,120
which supports email alerts so you're

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,300
always informed about the state of the

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,300
system

00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:23,500
so the last part of this lifecycle

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,210
maybe refurbishing it's not said that

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,220
you have to leave religion system but

00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,620
what in the system has been hijacked

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,590
what if a system one of a system has

00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,900
been compromised and you now got the

00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:38,200
update that takes us in security hole

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:41,680
which has been used for communication

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,840
okay easily we deployed the system with

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,140
this new update which accessible

00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,440
security hole to the predefined state

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:53,260
where it was before and there are other

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,540
synonyms mentioned before you can update

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:59,440
from one distribution release to another

00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:04,510
for example we have to guard when these

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,880
are 11 and you want to upgrade it to

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,530
minis floor you want what you want to

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,890
keep your system history you want to

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:15,430
keep the package profiles in zoom you

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:18,970
want to have the new system exactly the

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,860
same package set installed but you want

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,690
to have to the same cultivate gate with

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,000
configuration files you can simply we

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,280
provision this system to new

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,390
distributions thing as you can select

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:34,810
cakes but files which you want this

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:38,290
process use open source to a collect

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:41,890
phone it's part of the any part of the

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:44,800
puppet project and it supports Kathy and

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,410
it's a box block for we corrosion

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,120
resistant the it as mentioned the

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,640
initial force as a favorite for

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,110
engineering systems normally done here

00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:58,840
PXE of a laptop the boot either the

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,630
refurbishing process does not meet pixie

00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,240
anymore it supports it or it does not

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:09,100
it simply has an entry to a rock mini

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:13,780
and boots into it if you want to then it

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:16,570
starts to kickstart process and select a

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:21,310
profile you have to fight in the user

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,950
interface you can zoom package profiles

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,580
to

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:27,560
system so it behaves as before or you

00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,840
can sync your package both eyes to a

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,180
different system so you want to make a

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:36,560
new system look like another one you can

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:40,790
simply zoom this package profile to keep

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,880
an in-state we provision can be should

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,740
dueled so you can set this evening or

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,220
this night I want to be installed all my

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:52,550
machines at 10 o'clock you can even look

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:56,600
that you can set 30 machines of 10 and

00:14:52,550 --> 00:15:00,560
protrusions that we level so one major

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,530
aspect at least for QA and for eyes oh

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,770
and lettuce and things like that is

00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,600
keeping this tool so you know what you

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,610
system what has happened to your system

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,230
everything every step that has happened

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,860
to your system is documented in the

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,980
history you can just close it purely the

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:21,050
new system is still associated the

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,320
reprovision system still associated with

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:31,850
his old system so you can always make

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:33,440
what happened in the past so I'm also

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,840
want to tell you a bit about perfect

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,990
strategy before I show you how it looks

00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,660
like because if you see if you can

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:45,890
imagine what I'm talking about

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:49,370
as always it's whether for a project and

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:51,950
similar to Padova it contains the latest

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,920
and the greatest technology there's very

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,110
short polite release cycles you can

00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,930
expect new releases there with three to

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,510
six months so if you want to work with

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,970
Facebook in the future you have to think

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,130
about that because you have to find a

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,500
way how you manage to use Facebook

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:12,670
system for in sense because you want to

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:16,010
update it to and you've got one

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:20,180
will this release you will need to

00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:22,670
repeat recited it may be some sometimes

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,940
discredit strategy of the product may

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:31,400
change a bit of course they are plans to

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:35,300
include funk instead of Ozark for remote

00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:37,760
commands and Java so maybe from one

00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,480
religion to another if you have to find

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,860
an upgrade scenario that works people

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,720
the next thing is you won't get

00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,170
enterprise support at least for weapons

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,770
at least what I know from now and maybe

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:55,010
in the future there are some small a lot

00:16:51,770 --> 00:17:00,290
of companies will give you enterprise as

00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:02,570
a ladies for spacewalk to so you so you

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,420
don't have the enterprise resort but you

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:08,810
have the backend of the community space

00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:12,410
what has very little and large community

00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:15,650
which grows from day to day and you can

00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:20,330
use aligning this or ESS to ESP channel

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:26,660
to communicate yeah who develops this

00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:29,660
product whether it is still the mainly

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:33,500
responsible for the development of space

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:35,690
book but we already had for a few crew

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,600
contributions for missile engines and

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,880
this is to open everyone is invited to

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,390
take part in the product it will Google

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,360
for example at the moment it supports

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,460
federal centers as well in the future

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,090
you are looking to support other

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:56,030
distributions too we have quite a work

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,250
the support force allows because it's in

00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,410
satellite server but we are looking for

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,170
support for Debian some of the guys are

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:06,070
still already working to support to

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:09,380
bring deviants but in two spacewalks and

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:11,330
other distributions are to come so if

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,070
you like the product and if you want to

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,410
help to improve it to support your

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,830
distribution because I know many of you

00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:22,520
don't does not use to abuse at all

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:25,760
senses you have invited to head

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:29,270
the spectrum and the infrastructure is

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,149
already there but one of the future

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:35,480
plans is suppose to support a stress

00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:38,270
qualification and that's the major leg

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,610
space walk has at the moment at the

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:44,299
moment its Facebook only supports our

00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:46,669
today s database engine and as Oracle is

00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:49,340
a commercial project you have either to

00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:52,190
decide which you buy it or to use the

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:55,190
free version of it it's called okay

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:58,100
let's see but it's very limited one of

00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,960
the limitations is then it has a 4

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,260
gigabyte database limit

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,149
so at the moment space what can either

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,700
be used with a full-featured ultra

00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:09,919
database all your weight or you just

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:13,630
want to take a look at the project I

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,520
would suggest you to take a look at it

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:20,480
import things like CentOS because it

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:24,070
don't take much space and wait for help

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,830
to get most web browsers upon into it

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:30,350
otherwise you will get frustrated soon

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:33,289
because of 4 gigabyte database will be

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:37,789
bloated with 2 or 3 fedora releases then

00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:42,080
its Facebook has begun so what we wanted

00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:46,700
to do we want you well when we where we

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,559
are now first so very long and we have a

00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,720
working software patch management system

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,750
all the components are shown our wife

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,960
Angela that work correctly and there's a

00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:59,570
satellite server from with space bodies

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,260
upstream is already a table mattifies

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:07,960
opponent these features are we prove

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:12,200
some of them are new but they work and

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:14,270
it also supports some kind of software

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,000
it hard to inventory that's very basic

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:20,080
at the moment hopefully that that would

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,539
be a part that we've been extended and

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:27,470
what I am looking for is even a bit more

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:29,240
complex configuration management at the

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,260
moment we welcome asked can only be

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,260
executed manually

00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:38,630
at least what I was looking for is to

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:42,650
associate remote commands to config file

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:45,950
to join us so you can power mode command

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:49,070
to copy file you know it already

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,230
supports KVM antennas guest assistant so

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:59,210
he can easy provision from virtual

00:20:51,230 --> 00:21:02,510
environments and what can we do

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:06,200
where what has the community already

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:11,930
done in the past years we have ever done

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:15,050
a sealing salting component and they are

00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:17,390
truthful method logic long dark was

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,850
sitting here has developed a tool called

00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,580
an we call which may be used to fetch

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:25,070
packages form upstream if you want to

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:29,120
deploy wet head so this works

00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:33,050
we got tools for a water clone so we can

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:37,100
fetch the what ask for web head while

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:40,120
you can even import the Central's audit

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,820
mails to gain weight the waters pesetas

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:46,340
we got nice many necessities as much to

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,880
perform and we got great documentation

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:55,550
the documentation is an object page of

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:57,800
fedora it's easily easy to edited as

00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:03,080
it's Anne Ricci only didn't need and

00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:07,490
fast account to exist okay I'm going to

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,690
hold on here and maybe you already have

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,990
some questions

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:14,290
otherwise we gonna show you how it looks

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,290
like

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,310
yep why not the whole dissolution

00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,470
notified another package the package is

00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:29,610
not but the major information of

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:31,470
packages and its loads so fast as we got

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:37,020
how many pictures premiere other video

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:38,790
right now 16 sound packages and delete

00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,660
the information of these packages blown

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:47,210
speed entities we got environments with

00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,210
database size of 30 gigabytes

00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:09,040
yep TMI to the Dirac equation fire

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,290
management on yeah you can define

00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,750
Pfizer's local image or centralized

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,870
management so if you define a file is

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:19,540
locally managed this it is simply pulled

00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,370
from the machine and integrated in the

00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,370
configuration arrangement you can

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:27,760
override it but the locally mention

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:49,720
fights always got the higher lights you

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:52,360
can combine it you have to decide where

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,520
to go and that's one of the aspects of a

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,340
centralized management because what I

00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,309
want I want no more local changes on our

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,070
machines if so I want to define these

00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:05,230
files to be locally managed otherwise I

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:08,559
do not need a centrally managed system I

00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:11,710
don't want to go to the PC and fix it

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:15,330
there only the there's no other way as

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,330
the hardware spoken or something

00:24:29,070 --> 00:25:03,000
I am okay you want to combine and you

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,340
can leave that company alone if you want

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,840
to of course and simply use the other

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:10,080
conservationists and fight for your

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,990
configuration but it's not possible to

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:22,950
not given a conservation let's that

00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:24,389
would be really cool feature you can

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,659
export the configuration of this

00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:29,279
configuration files and put in

00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:31,159
subversion from there you can also

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:39,679
import it from another configuration

00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:43,340
that's okay we got flooded here

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:47,610
hopefully we will see a bit of the

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:52,769
system so this is how space what looks

00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:56,519
if you log in you see your overview page

00:25:52,769 --> 00:26:00,450
is customizable you can clock in your

00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:03,870
major tasks you want to see what we want

00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:07,039
to show you now is how you should set up

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:10,289
or how you should go ahead and start

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,870
deployment process first of all I want

00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:15,679
to show you how to create an easily part

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:20,340
for example to clean the system -

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:23,700
Sandeul a short here you select the

00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:26,009
system task creating a group grouping is

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,370
very important to manage your systems so

00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:35,940
you have to think first before you as

00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:39,640
always and mostly so you can get you can

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:42,530
only give a group name and move this

00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,920
group description you can associate this

00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:47,330
group with system administrators one of

00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,920
the cool features of spacewalker

00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:52,370
encephalitis that it's

00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:55,130
multi-organizational capable so you can

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:58,610
create multiple artists without with one

00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:01,400
one within one installation and allow

00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:05,030
users to share these channels between

00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,790
these ones this was one of the aspects

00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,530
which was very important in our scenario

00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:13,280
because we got many different

00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:16,310
departments which water at their home in

00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:20,570
first functions you can go ahead access

00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:22,610
watching poop but you don't roll here to

00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:24,980
allow the single system administrator to

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:34,340
all the energy manage machines within

00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:37,280
this specific next step we'll show you a

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,830
kick start over within the kicks are

00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,410
profile with it you can create a new

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,750
patient profile from which you can

00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:47,300
provision your system first of all you

00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,640
give it a label say what is the base

00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,360
channel I have imported different

00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:56,090
channels before I'll show you more later

00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:58,670
and you select the kick start of the

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,440
tree which is like the criminal and the

00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:04,190
inner birthday which should be loaded

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,080
via pixie and you could also also select

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:09,230
a visualization type if you are

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:13,910
positioning of the last one that's the

00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:18,700
first step of the quite complex kicks up

00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:18,700
wizard you can give a wood password here

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:25,150
now we UK star

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,270
what passes machine

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:43,400
so easy kicks up awful details at least

00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,530
a part of it the salaries resolutions

00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,950
800s

00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:52,820
since 600 here you see the settings we

00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:54,980
have pretty fundable you can add

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:58,070
selections you can first of all you have

00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,220
to activate it but its default you can

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:04,100
not custom PostScript so you want to

00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:06,500
monitor your collision process now this

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,929
could be really helpful you can clear up

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,020
the case file the configuration father

00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:14,390
so file itself you can define

00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:21,470
organizational unit settings and color

00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:24,070
options maybe we can take a look for

00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:27,140
example and the Advanced Options tab

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:29,809
will be Advanced Options you can define

00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:33,679
nearly every aspect that is available

00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:37,159
within a kickstart front you can define

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,799
a network attack you can define the your

00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:43,100
words your clicks have a form you can

00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:46,059
define partition layout and so on and so

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:49,669
on if you know how to kick start well or

00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:52,600
samples of you normal system you know

00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:59,360
which of the options could be set here

00:29:52,600 --> 00:30:02,539
documented and then in within the bare

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,990
metal kickstart tab we can pre-select IP

00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:08,960
ranges that should be booted

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:12,590
automatically into these kickstart

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:17,390
profiles you can add seen RP lists or

00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:24,169
wages and you want to do that you have

00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:26,059
to set up an DHCP server that the px is

00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:29,000
rather the integrated competencies

00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:31,390
tomorrow as next service so it within

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,390
from

00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:43,350
okay maybe we could take a look at the

00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:45,930
software you can define pretty funny

00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:49,200
cages which will should be installed on

00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:52,470
the newly forgiving system at the moment

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,960
here they ask naked solution as you know

00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:58,290
if you're familiar with Kickstarter

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,630
conditions you can define groups package

00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:03,390
boots which are available with the

00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:06,320
outside you can add single packages you

00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:09,300
can exclude packages with a minus sign

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:16,020
everything you can do when it kicks up

00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:18,690
front let me down here one of the

00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,580
important aspects is that it kicks up

00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:24,170
profile has to be associated with

00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:28,050
activation fees this is more

00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:32,760
historically because when it uses these

00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:35,970
activation keys for licensing here it

00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,590
has some different to the function so we

00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:43,760
can take a look at the activation key

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:43,760
stops now and get away the new one so

00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:51,920
they give you the name the keys

00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:51,920
automatically generated when you don't

00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:58,410
you can select the base channel and you

00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,120
say it can select the Edit entitlements

00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:04,770
this is important if you want to use

00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:07,320
things like traffic visualization now

00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:11,490
you can see the details of this you need

00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,820
newly created activation this activation

00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:17,100
key is associated to child channels and

00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,140
channels so as you have seen before the

00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,770
Kickstarter between only allows you to

00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:26,940
define a basic channel for the kickstart

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:29,520
if you want to access these additional

00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:32,940
repositories as we have added a few

00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:36,330
journalists with the huge repository

00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:38,310
which contains the necessary tools that

00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:41,610
have to be installed on the client you

00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:43,900
can select them here and you can also

00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:45,940
select packages

00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,660
have to be installed after registration

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,570
of the system to this baseball stone

00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:56,650
within the configuration tap you can

00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:59,110
associate a configuration channel from

00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:02,620
which files should be denied doing stuff

00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:08,170
to fix up courses you can click root

00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:10,870
seal you can now join you can let the

00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:13,990
system automatically join the previously

00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:17,230
generated group so if you fix up this

00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:19,780
system this will also directly appear

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:26,350
within the group and you can manage it

00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:30,540
from there afterwards maybe we can take

00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:37,630
a look at the configuration file

00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:41,770
management as always you have to play

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:45,250
the chant the name is used in common

00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:49,540
places we create an example

00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:52,060
configuration channel now this

00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,260
configuration figure a trailer can now

00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,170
contain files

00:33:53,260 --> 00:34:00,630
we can either end of the file directly

00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:00,630
within this editor or can simply upload

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:10,899
maybe you can just simplify you can

00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:14,679
define the user group context and you

00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:17,290
also can define the s L in its context

00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,659
here which may be were important if you

00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:22,450
activate X is 8 minutes on the system's

00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:25,649
what else again as you can see here

00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:28,480
Michael script used Mike ones are

00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:31,030
started with a parameter and entered

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,830
which can be predefined here you can

00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,899
take a look at the reference which

00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:37,840
markers are supported at the moment a

00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:42,340
lot of mark was and use microphone host

00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:47,890
names appear as mentioned and add custom

00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:50,169
key changed to them yeah we only got one

00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:52,929
religion right now maybe you can create

00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:57,149
a new revision of the spy you can still

00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:57,149
an uploaded where is team

00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:14,880
so we want to know which file we are

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,910
going to not and now we can change the

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,770
file we can dip it here for the GUI we

00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:22,920
can also use command line utilities

00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:26,520
utilities to do that and now we can use

00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:30,570
user component as you can see the line

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:37,400
is change and we can easily work changes

00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:41,220
as necessary this newly created

00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,200
calculation could be associated that the

00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,290
kickstart for file as a software child

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,840
before only we work with Activision

00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,210
history maybe we can just switch back to

00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,760
the activation key open like to keep the

00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:57,240
activation key that we have created and

00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:01,580
associate this configuration channel to

00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:04,320
visit the enter key what does it means

00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,820
if you activate that computation file

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,210
should be deployed too in case that

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,920
forces the kickstarted system already

00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,740
contains the packet resistant to be

00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,950
pre-selected and it already contains the

00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:20,490
configuration files which are within

00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:23,130
this channel so what again is a

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,880
completely configured system within one

00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,790
step

00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,160
I don't I personally don't know many

00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:39,360
other systems that can do things like

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:42,510
that ok what can we show are there some

00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:46,410
components you want to see we have 5

00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:48,860
limited as we can it's a demo planned at

00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,860
the moment

00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:11,170
yeah kickstart files can contain scripts

00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:13,690
bottom three scripts which will be

00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,599
executed and defined state of kicks up

00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:19,869
process and these proofs can also be

00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:23,800
added here these clips can include

00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:28,420
snibbles this is part of cobbler that's

00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:30,790
popular got a wide mighty snippet engine

00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,160
we have some smoke pretty fast if it's

00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,119
here maybe we can just open it smooth it

00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,710
to take a look at it

00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,960
this little on there for configuration

00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:43,390
so you can either see a snippet which

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,720
contains or something like a script that

00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:49,470
does something we can predefine these

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,790
lipids and easily reuse them in

00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:54,520
different kicks our pool parts

00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:57,700
so once the work is done is done for all

00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:01,510
the cakes for profiles as we could carry

00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:05,050
a commons boots that can be reused you

00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:07,830
can either use these bits that are

00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:11,950
predefined I can define your own

00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:14,380
snippets in order to use them in essence

00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,690
energy as never can easily be added into

00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,280
a script in form of the zoo products

00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,970
here you can see it

00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,849
this box is never which we have seen

00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:28,089
before

00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:29,920
within the PostScript for example you

00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:33,540
have to activate the templating engine

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,540
in order to make it happen

00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:50,690
bringing we configure inform of change

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:54,470
of setting you can what you do is you

00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:57,920
create system groups yet have several

00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:00,500
similar system systems can even select

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,050
the system for itself can't be put into

00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:06,109
a motor system into the system set

00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,579
natural and managers for them here is a

00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:10,550
system set matter we don't have a

00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:13,400
realistic system usually control it but

00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:15,890
now but you can simply select one say

00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,290
that system manager with the system set

00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:22,460
measure while you can mention group of

00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:27,470
systems and for example it's one load

00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:30,680
command deployed configuration fires

00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:33,770
deploy Eliza updates but she do with

00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:42,680
normal package installations should will

00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:46,450
update it will be trapped in the history

00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:49,190
of the system nearly every change that

00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:51,800
in it has been in see us for the week

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:55,280
when we track them in history so you can

00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:58,490
see the system will successfully what

00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,730
happens to do to the provision the new

00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:04,640
process you can see a config file on was

00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:08,050
successful and you can put it try it

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,050
using the more time

00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:15,190
ok do you have any more questions

00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:36,040
there's about half what you can do is

00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:38,560
you can reduce the client to the system

00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:42,520
okay we just said afterwards manage it

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,310
within the system what you can also do

00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,280
you can create a similar click stop file

00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:50,140
with with a fixed up wizard and if you

00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,360
want to reinstall it a we provisional

00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,820
system you can use this except fire to

00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,380
be installer version and then you gotta

00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,450
use

00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,580
well we already got is within our

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:02,620
immigration system ariel will already

00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:05,380
had a few systems that we have to

00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:08,740
register it already has been installed

00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,690
because we got an working environment if

00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:14,100
we simply register than they and let the

00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,100
admins create their

00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:29,260
yeah don't ask me about nothing we

00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:34,180
have deactivated

00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:36,190
I personally but it has basics allows

00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:45,010
supported that you will find some

00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:46,900
documentation of that in the wicked yes

00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,569
mentioned before I'm awkward successful

00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:53,109
monotone voices what's a puppet at a

00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:55,299
popular theory tool for the role from

00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:57,789
Hard Rock birds and it has been

00:41:55,299 --> 00:42:02,079
integrated into a system five years ago

00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:04,359
has been integrated in second so what

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,460
some of the engineers are thinking about

00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:10,359
is to switch to a more colorful

00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:13,119
for example mania something again but

00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:16,119
that is one of the main cool aspects of

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,430
this folder because it doesn't matter

00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:21,789
which comic metrics will is use in the

00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:25,569
back end if they implement negatives for

00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,819
example the user interface I guess it

00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:30,250
will still look the same

00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:33,190
maybe some more options will come you

00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:35,319
will feel so familiar with the user

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:44,579
interface that is very important for

00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:44,579
normal activating ok

00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:58,420
just just Nate we have to configure rate

00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:01,300
or change file settings currently with

00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:04,300
just good specific image with scripts on

00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,850
which just do that and then we do the

00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,810
normal provisioning um I would Stewart

00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:13,240
simply the same way I would add a singer

00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:15,340
customized image which our boot over PC

00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:33,100
and let it do the script and afterwards

00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:36,910
oh no the robot functionality works on

00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:39,480
the software component section you can

00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:50,520
go the Akaka changes any computation

00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:50,520
that's very important okay okay

00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:14,080
it's simply apply the configuration

00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:17,400
measure is something that definitely

00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:22,140
could be expand in an extended school

00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:25,140
but at the moment it's what something

00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,140
