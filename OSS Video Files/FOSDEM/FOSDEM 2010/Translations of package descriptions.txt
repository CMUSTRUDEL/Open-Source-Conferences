ok so I'm anukunna I'm managing a giant

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,740
in inman river and I have a big task

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,049
also to speak with a lovely black

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,890
community and makes things very well

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:20,279
together we were speaking with the event

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,710
a song from adventures some months ago

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,789
about one program we have in both

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:30,090
dissolution which is having up-to-date

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,090
description for packages means summaries

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:37,860
and descriptions it's a big big problem

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:41,070
for newbies coming to linux because that

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,040
just can't find the application that

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,340
would like to install so we put it on

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,420
top of the list bow to the list that's

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,809
someone and then it went up and down up

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,260
down and we didn't sign any time finally

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,079
to to work on this project so thoughtful

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,939
then was a nice place to work again on

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,710
this project because there are some

00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:11,130
people from a lot of distributions that

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,979
could help to see how we could make this

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,630
project work so well so it's going to

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,540
and i'll give you some more details

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:23,939
about what we would like to do during

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:32,159
these three minutes together thanks so

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:35,280
um go to next night yeah so we have some

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,130
slides ready but we don't want to talk

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,710
about that we want to have a discussion

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,750
with you and to try to come to know what

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,630
all the descriptions are doing and we

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,149
want to try to walk on a plan on to face

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,939
the issue were walking we were talking

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:56,380
about so we made some slides to explain

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:58,539
what we are aware of and

00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,969
what we have identified as potential

00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:04,450
solutions or implication and stuff like

00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:08,110
that but those are only a basis for

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:10,630
discussion with you so first I guess it

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,610
would be nice to know who is in there I

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,900
know that we have reach out from fedora

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,280
so we have at least one fellow our

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:22,450
people so although feed on people raise

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:27,040
your hand please three people do we have

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:33,519
some vegan people that's three people to

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:35,590
cool opensuse that's me dude one yes we

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:42,280
have many modular people but they're

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:45,250
just here to 22 nice gentle pickle one

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,290
person so maybe we'll be able to help us

00:02:45,250 --> 00:03:00,010
any other solution was I didn't my

00:02:49,290 --> 00:03:04,420
channel oh yeah oh yeah mark

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:07,840
shuttleworth yes we expect that that

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:13,739
will be sure deaveon actually so but the

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:17,139
temptation so yeah don't stay too to

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,090
toke and so I'm sorry to bother people

00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:21,130
who aren't going to to look at the video

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,030
because it might not be that just opened

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:29,170
but we want an interactive session

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:33,220
that's really main point so yeah um so

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:35,350
we decided that the start we just wanted

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,690
to tell you I fourth Kingdom and Ava or

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,489
how it's working in Bob and Susie and we

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,910
hope that you are able to tell us how

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:46,319
 your distribution yeah so I

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,319
think you're starting with modular

00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:56,740
okay it is how we are working on regard

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,710
to manage translation whether on

00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,960
salaries because we work on summaries

00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:05,770
and descriptions but description is just

00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:09,630
a big mess not a not up to date at all

00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:14,560
so I would just speak about summaries so

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:18,700
we have kind of script that extract at

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,150
regular time the strings from spec files

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:25,480
so we just pick up the summaries for all

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,970
packages then it's just very classical

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,180
way we it's a meeting at p.m. fights for

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:34,570
localization team and all this is

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,900
committed in svn this is a first problem

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,760
for us because we don't have any

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:44,020
easy-to-use solution for translators

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,030
they have to edit by hand and commit in

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:51,490
svn which is the first for us the first

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:54,250
major problem then all this translation

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,970
does in one package we call it ND DNT

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,830
unsavory in our distribution this is a

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,750
big big package I think it's something

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:07,900
like 20 20 ninja something like that and

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:11,470
in our all our installation so we read

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:15,070
the package and we install it by default

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:18,840
in the chrome packages of the

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:25,690
distribution so that it can be used by a

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:28,810
TV fdm black and the ketones which is

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,390
which I am pm and European e so these

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,480
tools are patched to get these strings

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:39,960
so that when you use clay or chili you

00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,960
can get the trains translated

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,569
how nicely so I'm happy to be after hand

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,400
because I can say to you that

00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:57,409
wing Wallace using the same process to

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,120
talk about that father the main

00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,759
difference is that instead of installing

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,750
a package on the machine of the end user

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:10,129
we just put the translation some meta

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:12,229
data file that is used by AC / so we

00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:14,389
don't install a package which other that

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:16,639
zipper is going to fetch the data that

00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:22,129
is needed all translations that's the

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:24,860
many difference so we were wondering how

00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:27,319
other institutions are doing that and we

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,719
know that DN is translating the

00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,409
description of packages not quite sure

00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:38,120
how we at some point I look at that but

00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:39,979
I forgot so if you want to give an

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,139
overview of how distortion is

00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:46,520
translating description of packaging

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:52,009
summers of baggage please be our guest

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:57,050
and raise your hand just look if anybody

00:06:52,009 --> 00:07:02,620
knows so I see that we shall be saying

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,620
you don't know no idea about cetera cool

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:24,099
yeah but the moment the maggots

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:28,930
descriptions in English are stupid and

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:31,900
the packages file and which is what's

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,310
downloaded by up another tools to get

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:41,830
you the luster packages for you to

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:46,900
install and through various tools like

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:55,000
it's a web-based still others translated

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:56,680
and up no nose to download file called

00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,199
translations which includes the

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,199
translations for just your language

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:08,080
that's roughly how it works so yeah I

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:13,080
think I made some help to watch open to

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,080
these days reach out

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:21,880
I didn't know how you would have to run

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:25,000
I can show yes I'll please fedora we

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,980
expect the package so I'd we want to be

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,960
seven years the descriptions get put

00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,640
together and then maybe two or three

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,990
months later to translate some of the

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,979
summaries some of the descriptions it

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:38,500
was just putting this not updated specs

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,539
though inch which are you on users and

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:46,120
it's installed by default so Doris

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:53,560
basically doesn't work cool happy to

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:56,380
hear that ok any other solution well not

00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:03,970
freely on the technical part but at the

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:06,600
Fedora a work on stuff which is unlike

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,520
software which is usually made by

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,210
English speakers I work on stuff which

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:17,320
is packaged but originates local ridges

00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:22,630
and very often the description of the

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:27,280
Train website is not in English and when

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:30,580
I found why do myself packet for this

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,040
kind of material well so English

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:38,230
description which is done by the

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,270
packager is a very poor yeah and the

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,630
translations of the very poor

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,670
description are even worse latest

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:50,710
written so so for people who didn't hear

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:54,130
what you say there are some packages for

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:57,280
for applications which are a lot by

00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,900
people will not doing the kitchen in a

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,400
specific language not in English by

00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,590
default for example so the website is

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,300
not in English and so when you package

00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,640
that and you write a description for

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,470
that package english

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,650
or you just put some crap because you

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:20,290
don't have a good business and so let's

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:22,300
strip did anybody else for that also one

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,970
thing packaged is doing is taking the

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,700
desktop tile this is like a happy metric

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,190
on which attitude that's the file or

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,860
package and then packages installed

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:35,800
means the desktop file but the default

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,170
desktop file and tries to use the sunset

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,350
in there which is also a giant acting

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,350
work

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:59,450
okay so that's next puffle sweet okay so

00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:05,090
we are a bit consumed in the the thing

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:08,210
we have that this work is basically done

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:13,220
in a very bad way at the moment and this

00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:15,320
is because usually this is a very huge

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,290
workload I mean inland without for

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,360
example we have don't let our team

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,640
working on it and trying to have these

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,610
summaries help to date but even for the

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,400
main repository which is not today to

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:31,340
read the stories there are lots of legs

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,070
inside so that's why we use book

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,170
together a recent song and just have in

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,380
mind what about sharing this and I

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:42,140
between distribution having some kind of

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:44,840
come on data buzz for this salaries and

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:50,360
description what this is big work

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:54,680
because it means we we work with a lot

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:58,220
of distributions so the point now for

00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,400
the common presentation is what is in

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,040
imply the point earner is not to find a

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,130
final solution but we would like really

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,440
to have some concrete conclusions so

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:13,760
that we can set up and start on this

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,940
project for real after for them so we

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,390
have listed some are some problems with

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:24,980
you can see so now if we start this

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:27,320
project and this is we would like to see

00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,660
them that as problem but as a part of

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,870
solution so that the final solution

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:36,230
could be workable for the distribution

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,630
who would like to join us so it's not an

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,540
obligation so now we'll try to welcome

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:44,060
this with at least one river and open

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,100
source and the most distribution is

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,550
about distribution we are I think the

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,800
more profitable it should be so we

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,070
switch so five problems this is not

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,810
exhaustive so if you have any other

00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:01,000
comment to that on this page then

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:04,000
just feel free to come on this we just

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,390
have some comment about all this one so

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,110
in addition lounge I mean we have to

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:13,900
start then the existing policies in all

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,610
the solutions the difference is in

00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:21,070
packaging and managing sub packages the

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,410
managing of strains please in the race

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:27,930
and install calories which can be a

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,930
problem and some social considerations

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:42,010
ok so uh as you've seen if we want to

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,800
open that the one of the the first step

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,540
would be to have the same description

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,280
than same submerged st. Mary's because

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,530
Johnson translations to share

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,130
translations we have to share the Texas

00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:57,720
first and right now the first issue with

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,770
that that well we have descriptions in

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,740
all distributions which are different

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:06,220
for the packages so we would have to

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,810
choose one description which could be

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,970
the best for each package between the

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,510
district and Indiana federer in modular

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,790
i'm going to need opportunity whatever

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:18,370
which so that's what we call the initial

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,950
merge what should we start with what

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:23,710
should people translate because we don't

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:31,030
want people to translate the description

00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:35,170
of all decisions so it's it's it's a bit

00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:37,720
difficult because there is some

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,030
laboratory chose to do there and since

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,060
that everybody has already some history

00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:46,330
with some infrastructure and bubble of

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,940
different teams it it's there is a

00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:53,980
social issue and then we have to also

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:55,480
decide which one is best so that's one

00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:01,570
of the first step who to have to solve

00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:03,179
and so what do you take about that how

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:08,379
do you think we should then help

00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:11,079
is it important to to to to choose since

00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:13,720
the beginning for all packages what

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:17,999
would be the best description and all

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,999
that so we have to commence with the

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:29,649
main consideration I guess is how many

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:32,790
strings have to translate and how how

00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:36,449
much time but require to review each

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:40,419
description to be translated I guess

00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:44,129
this is too huge and you have to make

00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:50,350
some compromise as a former translator I

00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:55,419
wouldn't be I wouldn't feel bad if my

00:15:50,350 --> 00:16:01,230
translation would be abandoned to and

00:15:55,419 --> 00:16:03,879
the opensuse description we kept I mean

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:07,360
there has to be a starting point and

00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:11,350
that doesn't that in my humble opinion

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:16,779
that doesn't prevent someone to continue

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:26,799
contributing to translating but in a in

00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:29,649
a wide a team to work efficiently okay

00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,379
so i assume that for most of the

00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:35,199
packages there is an upstream project

00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:38,470
and i'm aware that now there is some

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:45,879
effort in creating some format for

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:52,689
storing project yet though so i was

00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:55,720
thinking to have the upstream the pack

00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:57,180
or put some patches that each option

00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,730
project has a description

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:03,210
and then some Rose lines is the depth

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:06,270
the developer for fires because I think

00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:08,640
that we both die again in the ipn with

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:11,160
the package insane have the binary and

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,040
then you have the headers and all the

00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,020
development packages and I don't know if

00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:22,650
there is in bed young there are data and

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:28,740
binaries so have some conventions about

00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:31,050
how to add besides because in condemning

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,690
have this is the my packages and now and

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,910
that description for the development is

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,370
just the development for and usually the

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:45,200
description is just stop you from from

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:48,300
the maintenance from my package yes yes

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,970
so basic again so you can just come get

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:56,510
any interest rates yes yes and yeah and

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:59,940
us in debian where each package has

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:04,410
about somehow like three part so it's

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:08,760
angry more second part and double your

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:10,620
parts over something like like like to

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,890
to create some section like the main

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,070
description and then the purpose so the

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:21,810
project from which the package belongs

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:24,210
to and then the specialist is the expert

00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,930
a data contains development contains

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,930
translation

00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,789
yes I think if a good starting point

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,940
would be to have an online website like

00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:44,999
what chapo is doing run g for global you

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,629
can translate strings online that a

00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:51,509
website where you can choose to either

00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:53,070
translator already over with you and you

00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:57,809
can of course never reaching around

00:18:53,070 --> 00:19:00,090
translate a sentence and and I think

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:03,149
it's a good entry point to to signify to

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:07,200
ease the process of translating first so

00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:10,609
that you can new users without a much

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,559
knowledge can translate swings and

00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:16,649
that's I think something which is which

00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:19,889
would be very interesting to him does

00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:22,100
this solve the world's problem the March

00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:26,360
because I think

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:39,150
tree after the scene is just SAT the

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:41,550
community each one has yes sometimes

00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,290
they overlap but we don't you agree that

00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,660
we should choose one comment which

00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:54,180
summary each once it's a community

00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:56,720
should choose or you can put it some

00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:01,890
kind of fun and go to in system mode

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:08,670
that's as a skill I mean yes but because

00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:10,860
we are hideous 20,000 a hike says oh

00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:19,830
right this creature is the one that's

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:22,800
previous I think fundamentally sleepy

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,840
ancestry because upstream knows but

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,480
description changes they caught me way

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,700
to the PO translation invite is already

00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,260
so I think translating Luke force a very

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,790
very good as it makes you half the way

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:39,600
there or needs or nopee desktop UI stuff

00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:42,270
yes I don't mean to me some tips about

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,539
us we have to try yeah exactly XML but I

00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,999
am

00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:49,840
it's for the best it's a very quick fix

00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:51,369
it again she on these tips and I think

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,369
with this was going to do keys under a

00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:56,559
package a point here it's very own

00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:58,840
kitchen items today degree which

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,820
summaries descriptions sub packages

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,729
numbers of packages whether it's beveled

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,149
there whatever is spinning really trivia

00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:08,649
yes but I assume that fifty percent of

00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:11,830
the package they don't have some baggage

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:14,139
so there should be a good start to have

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,960
the artistry or yeah definitely we

00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:20,080
should start from upstream from there to

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,489
see you soon install Firefox you know

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,899
you're still so you can get the

00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:27,309
experience check the upstream

00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:30,039
description I think if your computer in

00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:32,649
sub packages I feeding sub packages less

00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:36,099
important translation a cure for it did

00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:40,090
you say libraries for information you

00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:43,809
guys are so so just some generic strings

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:46,179
for library or data yeah how do you do

00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:54,039
it better so good it's destroys my

00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:58,479
little bit but I think that in practice

00:21:54,039 --> 00:22:00,879
way description different energy from

00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:03,220
these distributions usually is that

00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:07,659
because the description of the extreme

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:12,129
website sucks so everyone is inventing

00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:14,590
something to fill in the bar so if there

00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:17,799
is a project to help of streams make

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:21,820
good descriptions because friends do not

00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:24,729
always have the capacity to do a good

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,739
description in a good language well for

00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:30,009
our purposes good language is English

00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:32,590
because all set on slightly teams know

00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:36,009
how to translate from English to

00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:38,499
something else if you inject a very good

00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:41,620
description which is not English in the

00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:47,590
process nobody knows how to handle

00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:52,580
so a project that would propose with

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:54,740
descriptions in English to extremes the

00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,380
right size not too long because too long

00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:01,070
it's manageable well except you don't

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:16,510
want what without any technical donation

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:19,340
behind I think that it's difficult

00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:21,650
abstract because you're in zero because

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:24,920
your people representing dissipations so

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,110
you have that problem so I think it's to

00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:32,600
the people or relating distribution to

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:34,210
solve that problem maybe maybe I would

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,440
propose interrupts train people to

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:39,260
supply some type of information but let

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,810
something which needs to be led by some

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,910
distributions and you have full size

00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,700
constraints in terms of the size of the

00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:49,580
line for the summaries of science and

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,650
subscribe part of the header etc so you

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,170
cannot leave that to up straight because

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:57,350
I don't care an unloved strain program

00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,330
manager I don't care mr. Lee in that

00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,730
case I care about you look here but

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,800
about a generally most of the upstream

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,630
projects they don't already care about

00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,360
packaging so why would they care about

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,670
the summary line of one package don't

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,050
have any clue of why is it a problem and

00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,900
why you should patron second in command

00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:18,350
so I see you need to lead that idet and

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:21,530
to find a way to satellite in place of

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:24,200
straining straining English and blue

00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,030
translation whatever another the

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,160
translations on would be problem to make

00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:31,280
it easier and little project proves to

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,200
be useful you will gather a community of

00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,180
people interested by developing it

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,870
because they will see the benefits of

00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,970
having such a project in place and I

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:44,740
think that API probably for what you

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,740
want you to achieve this really moment

00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:53,210
just to have this I think there is two

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:58,130
to two programs here is the before and

00:24:53,210 --> 00:25:00,760
the content so we should we should can

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,160
find a way it so that the content can be

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,650
also improved by extreme project I don't

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,960
know if you if you would use this kind

00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,390
of tool for example if you see that the

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,970
summary of the description is not good

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:17,930
enough are you going to go and use this

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,610
tool to improve it that's a question so

00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,610
this is that is one on the vacation

00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:28,000
question the next slide we have already

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:28,000
started to speak about this is about

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:37,730
policies for content and format so just

00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,770
a few words about montega we we have

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,770
some rules even if it's very basic

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:45,650
because we use a tool called and play me

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:47,900
eight which is built which is used when

00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:51,890
you approve the package and check some

00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:55,100
rules on format below was speaking about

00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:57,320
it and i think it was about the size of

00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,360
the line having your point at the end of

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,840
description not in summary and this kind

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,410
of things so that saw them you have well

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,140
formatted description and summary and we

00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,820
have some very informal checks on our

00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:15,140
maintenance mailing list we have some

00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:18,470
maintenance very kinky the prescription

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:21,890
and they help just to well format this

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,960
kind of this kind of text looks like

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,060
speaking business all that openness is

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,210
using also airplane so they have the

00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:33,920
same kind of check during a product

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:36,530
package maybe the young of has some kind

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:44,590
of tools I don't know the young

00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:44,590
developers sorry

00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:56,000
Samira okay how's that the solution yeah

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,760
Devon is well well we won't open okay

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:08,029
listen Josie check for content I mean

00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:10,519
it's really rudimentary check today they

00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:14,630
have any chest foods checks on this okay

00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:16,250
as memories also yeah okay the point is

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,880
that you don't have to stick to sing

00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:21,760
this format simple things like to a

00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,590
number of characters on a single line

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,990
you don't really have to specify to just

00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,909
a paragraph which can be extreme so

00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:36,049
that's a paddlin sing a lot Anthony

00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:37,909
process to be 70 64 yards on for your

00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:39,889
analyst when you put this in on site

00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:42,080
it's just because some distribution has

00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:44,510
some policy so when you want to merge in

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,519
a string project then you have to just

00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,860
to list what is existing at the moment

00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:52,820
in distributions what can be generalized

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:56,409
to help in checking this these are these

00:27:52,820 --> 00:28:01,760
descriptions well then it can be your

00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:07,330
personalized in or distribution yep also

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:13,090
the solution maybe we didn't ask 10 20

00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:13,090
is sleeping sorry

00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,590
okay so it looks basically that we have

00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:29,510
some format checking rules but nothing

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:34,640
for the content which is quite hard to

00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:37,850
do also travel automatic voice okay next

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,490
point watching for typos yeah I looking

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:43,070
for commandant typos in disruption test

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:57,620
yeah but I process we could have some

00:28:43,070 --> 00:29:12,590
sometimes I'd and then later LED chip

00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:16,040
for tables yeah oh nice ok ah not funny

00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:17,840
look sorry well I can shower um you also

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,130
have to standardize on a single spelling

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,590
of English since for our word for

00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:26,570
spellings for each basic American

00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:28,100
English I mean well that's what we

00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:35,570
usually know Terry that's prob why I'm

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:40,790
saying about ya see ya but that's

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:45,500
another page ah so I feel you all

00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:48,169
already discuss a bit about that so how

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,059
to two hundo solutions which have some

00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:53,530
package for some package but they don't

00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:56,120
have the exact same ship packages so

00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:58,100
since we only have 10 minutes that might

00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,100
be able to Steve that just to summarize

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,809
what people or it is all about that it's

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,559
probably possible to have a main

00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:08,240
description and then to use some

00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:11,150
boilerplate to say that this is the

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,040
library folder blood saw who's all the

00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,980
development vice for this library blah

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,059
blah so that's prolly we might be able

00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:22,240
to 22

00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:26,120
make these small as automatic

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:29,570
translations so that could help not have

00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:32,480
defeated walk their true but that would

00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:34,100
be something to keep in mind so I'm just

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,980
going fast because we know a lot of time

00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:46,190
that unless you want to say something

00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:49,730
else on this so one other issue that we

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:52,309
have to keep in mind that a lot of

00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,679
decisions are releasing at the same with

00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:57,470
the same development cycle like more

00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:03,050
than sixty six months but then you have

00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:05,960
also distributions which are using long

00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:08,210
long limit cycles like the enterprise

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,059
distributions we have open city which is

00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:13,730
using the eight or nine months ago I

00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:16,429
forgot which one and so we might not

00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:18,860
have the strength freeze at the same

00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:21,020
time so if we fix for example I

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,480
description for projects of alpha by

00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,660
cage this will break the translations

00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:30,230
and this might make some distribution

00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:32,600
had been happy so we might have to do to

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,980
use branches or source up like that to

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:38,110
make sure that the translations are

00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:40,340
always using both on somebody oh well

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,620
that's something to keep in mind

00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,050
actually that's not the issue i think

00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:48,170
just merely a technical issue but

00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:50,090
that'll be something to do not like

00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,679
every other project I mean having a

00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:54,679
really cycle and published regularly

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,440
some stable release yeah maybe in some

00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:00,620
yeah well you know yes except that you

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,080
would have two of us freeze still so you

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:09,050
don't have to align you the distribution

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:10,370
love them yeah yeah yeah I agree the

00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,700
monkey that if you change the

00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,700
description

00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,450
rulings that that's positive on the

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:30,130
solution to import change yeah when I

00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:31,990
want yes the thing that okay anyway so

00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:35,440
you seem to see that there's no issue so

00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:41,320
that's always cool it's keeping this

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:45,100
move let's move on okay the next one we

00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:47,260
saw and not the easiest one is about

00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:51,460
social consideration want it to be very

00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:56,350
optimist in this title working on this

00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:59,470
such kind of project is Mary asked

00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:02,530
having many different localization teams

00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:06,120
on one language if I take the mound

00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:07,900
River example for example we have 11

00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:12,370
representative for each language

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:15,130
managing some people one here and in

00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:17,320
this little team they can be they can

00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:19,900
disagree on for example number one I was

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,870
trying to to be translated so what about

00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:25,450
having people working together from the

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:29,160
young man river opensuse domain users

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:34,270
and managing maybe such kind of

00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:38,559
disagreement of translation compared and

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:41,380
how about how about managing the the

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,850
string which will be chosen for the

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:51,240
final decision as someone spoke about

00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:51,240
what but maybe how to terminate

00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:04,140
from microfiber viewing distribution

00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:06,299
will would like to share this strings

00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,359
it's just like they and share the

00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:13,950
upstream toe and then we should put this

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:18,179
distillation and upstream so if to do to

00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:21,450
do the translation option and that's how

00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:25,290
we we will solve the problem and what it

00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:29,600
upstream at your translator if well is

00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,600
the fallout from NATO public language

00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:42,240
for this project in itself it has been

00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:45,450
managed as a project well what's up if

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,280
if the project is not translated you

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,139
have the description which is translated

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,609
and you install it and it's not too late

00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:56,970
then what point I mean we we want to

00:34:53,609 --> 00:35:00,720
have the full translation from desktop

00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:03,900
file you had a lot of my cage which

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,980
display any user visible streets so you

00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,080
want to translate the package

00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,820
descriptions but there won't be any user

00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,960
visible stencil there's no translation

00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:15,650
that's why yes also nice assume that

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:20,250
also known there are some packages which

00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:22,910
don't have any visible and and they yes

00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,910
the present

00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:39,520
just upstream how to get well okay then

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:49,510
then we should all sit together and

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:51,730
create a new HR distribution ok so this

00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:55,750
is basically what to dispute resolution

00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:57,339
and your question and arbitrators

00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:00,300
usually work while our manager

00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:03,030
translation community from mediawiki and

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:06,730
what we have the opposite view and

00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:08,500
whenever I see this cute guy asked the

00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,660
people firing what is this about and I

00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:17,140
make a decision or they refer to it if

00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:20,080
they don't then you cannot fight over

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,790
over this indefinitely then someone has

00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,250
to make a decision that's my take at

00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:29,010
least what she proposes a kind of

00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:29,010
thought making some decision in case of

00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:39,970
confusing we think we put it at the end

00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,839
of the presentation but we think it may

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:46,180
be the most difficult thing to managing

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:51,060
this time project it should not be an

00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:51,060
obstacle to to have a good result

00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:58,029
don't take yourself too seriously okay

00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:12,259
okay so you say no just let people and

00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:14,359
it is the sensors okay a bit putting the

00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:15,829
translations upstream pulls down pretty

00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:17,719
hard which functions like the kernel or

00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:19,940
combination is Lydia Colonel Bob don't

00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:22,039
foul committed which translates it into

00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,779
two hundred languages I can't see that

00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,219
ever getting upstream so I think that's

00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:27,920
where they it needs to our casual

00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:30,109
approach upstream some respects it's

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:41,119
available otherwise fall back some like

00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:44,170
this makes a lot of sense any other

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,170
perfect on this one

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:59,290
okay so thanks for this just covers on

00:37:51,040 --> 00:38:01,930
all this dislikes yeah that's what we

00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:04,390
are going to just pick it up so now we

00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,550
have this first discussion so we're

00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:10,360
interested in fact you look real and

00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:12,460
concrete result on this so for the the

00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,260
guy is interested in this project maybe

00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:18,190
we can make just after the conference

00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:20,980
and take your name and do it now address

00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:23,500
and open mailing list plus mailing list

00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,470
then of course there will be a complete

00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,990
description and this and so on on this

00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,750
project but maybe we can start with a

00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:34,450
few people interested making some

00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:38,380
summary form form of this controls and

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:46,900
see how we can plan the very first steps

00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:48,850
for this project but if you have some

00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,020
contact that of people who could be

00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:57,130
interested in this we have our

00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:59,340
interested in Hindi yeah you should also

00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:02,290
use the distributions at three desktop

00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:04,660
authorities to gain an ancestor Damien

00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:14,560
or you're faring the contribution to Joe

00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:17,410
slap chef nation put it there is a

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:22,960
consolation shortly

00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:24,970
which is walking all this fun but I

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,930
think I guess yes predicts that could be

00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:38,590
a nice place than to watch this project

00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:42,760
yes yeah yeah I know ok so if sure you

00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:45,970
get interested just come after this so

00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:49,330
just to get a quick in a vehicle do you

00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:53,830
think that it's worth doing that what do

00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:56,320
you think I guess on yes raise your

00:39:53,830 --> 00:40:03,010
hands if you'll take its wanting wished

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:07,630
to try to do oh cool so that's what's a

00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:13,390
positive feedback so yes oh yeah oh so

00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:19,420
go and see n think you want you yeah

00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:22,770
yeah well I'm supposed to pass any last

00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:25,410
comment from many words someone is

00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:29,200
getting the upstream English

00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:33,310
descriptions right and fixed first very

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,950
important which can be started boooo

00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,810
still using the second part actually do

00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:45,070
translating it can be done yeah in a

00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:47,650
matter of doing translate nothing that

00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:50,200
we already have the experience of all

00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,280
the other teams we champion we have the

00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:59,510
depth popularity

00:40:52,280 --> 00:41:03,670
it is used to sew in use that's the

00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:07,960
problem is agree on something to share

00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:13,160
otherwise you just say how to manage the

00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:24,980
transition you will have a few only a

00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:27,050
few transactions think it could be

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:30,860
helped to each distribution inside out a

00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:36,490
way to Adam much and when to use it now

00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:39,080
 that's why project free desktop

00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:41,620
distribution are free to use it a lot

00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:44,960
it's not a navigation because otherwise

00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:49,160
it will not work so we just dance have a

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:52,520
strong base and save them there and help

00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,860
ask for translation then the solution

00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,260
and future use it or not we can have a

00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:59,780
planning than to see we start with this

00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:03,380
kind of back wages and try to make some

00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:06,530
translation in time but yes dissolution

00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:10,570
are free to also to make some clarity on

00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,570
it this is quite powerful so to decide

00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:20,030
so thanks everybody I hope you will join

00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:21,560
the boat and now you are like one minute

00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:24,850
left if you are not interested in

00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,850
