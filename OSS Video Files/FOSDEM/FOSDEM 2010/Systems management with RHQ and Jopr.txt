Title: Systems management with RHQ and Jopr
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2010
Description: 
	By Heiko Rupp

Jopr is the open source systems management and monitoring platform from JBoss / Red Hat. While it is specially tailored towards JBoss projects, it can be easily extended in various ways.

This talk will present the Jopr / RHQ system and its architecture and then talk about the extension points and how to write extensions for monitoring, management and alerting.

This presentation will also talk about the relation to RHQ-project.org, which used to be the upstream to Jopr and which now includes the Jopr bits.

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

okay hello again my talk about how HQ

00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:23,529
job on system management was that my

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:28,830
name is I go work for redhead and see my

00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:34,529
contact data here now when his talk was

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,529
asked about giving the talk I submitted

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,730
is our HQ I got an artifact are you

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:50,310
talking about Java yeah that cool

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:52,739
fabulous and now orange Julia and jboss

00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:56,430
operations neighborhoods what actually

00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:00,690
about is where the salsa management

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:04,320
projects our HQ and java and then we

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,810
have we rented ox being weathered oj was

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,830
a commercial tool called jay was

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:16,710
operation network which is bill those

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:18,869
two other words possible now in the past

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:25,310
and i will show some history slides

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:28,619
later on we have net project how HQ as

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,350
accommodation and on top of that we had

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,040
Johan which were elders Jay was

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:39,240
management this and a top of course is

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,880
built gyros on and since asks tell me

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,470
where we are in the lucky position that

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,680
we only have our HQ anyone so why was he

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,130
still see from Java hard there it is

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,659
being phased out our HQ is the open

00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:01,710
source project and our HQ is livin our

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:04,979
love our HQ project God so that's the

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,950
main wiki documentation side of the

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:11,340
whole project we don't have to write and

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm down or you cannot profit I will

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:18,190
my block and this gets indicated to the

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,150
cable box teen magazine first then we'll

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:24,370
have them somewhere in tazewell so I

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,349
wish you project or not we are using

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,110
some other infrastructure for a few

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,810
services like the Fedora hosted git

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:35,739
repository for all our power source code

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:38,319
and also the maxilla from redhead from

00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:41,920
now on we did have in the past two

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,580
separate GRI instances one at original

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:49,030
project report another one at java Jay

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,040
was the odd / Java but this was always a

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,620
little bit of pain for people who decide

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,220
if they want to be warned about our

00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,910
future in which issued record it should

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,400
then go so that's also gun now it will

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,160
drop on Geonosis but i should no longer

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,280
allow you to post new box so everything

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,660
in that area here in the gate with

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,480
people you will also find source of all

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,910
the pics from Howard cute and further we

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,380
don't have to go to two different

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:24,640
reprocess in the past it's now

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:27,340
completely innovative but before I

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,820
continue with those boring slides let's

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,450
go off for some demo and look at the

00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:37,600
application itself so it's about

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:41,250
monitoring and management of systems of

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,900
service from where we come from it's

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,900
mostly targeted as Jay was

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:52,830
like pajamas application server James

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:58,680
cash I relate and Tom kettle and better

00:03:52,830 --> 00:04:00,660
target but it's not exclusive I will

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,260
show you later a list of plugins that

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,560
are available that this is even complete

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:11,190
and it's simple to write a new plug-in

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:15,270
from you resource to manage so this one

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,250
here is the start page the dashboard we

00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,730
see the information about what you have

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:24,750
imagery the sink or platform that's

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:27,810
basically our machine well services run

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,670
on so what linux machine is one platform

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,090
and other way of machine is a second

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:36,060
platform and so on so this is call me my

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,870
laptop here small platform with 10

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,270
servers and 289 services I show your

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:47,340
needs so just take a forgiving at the

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:49,710
moment those thermal in service you put

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:55,560
down your staff is solve our jewelry

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:57,660
anyway so it out blue jean we don't have

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,809
any good define at work currently

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,789
getting a hard-on

00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:05,159
matrix which is measurement values in

00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:08,069
permanent from the measurement and

00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:10,139
subsystems up you have an order

00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,240
discovering author so when you play the

00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,729
system will show them to you up

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,210
there and then you can decide to take

00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:24,199
the internal injury or decide you don't

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:27,719
want and you jealous application server

00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,059
protest why the discovery run is coming

00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:37,259
in it will be discovered and shown up in

00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:39,330
this goblet like that guy and when you

00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,919
say no if not I production when I talk

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,649
want me to test something and I don't

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,139
want my choice you don't take it into

00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:50,069
emmanuel ii but you keep on ignorant

00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:52,499
when you have recently added resources

00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:56,819
so you see a history what is got added

00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:58,979
to the system can define variants the

00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:01,379
seizure of our recent alerts which

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:06,120
announced our fire i will talk about a

00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:09,569
lot more in detail later on he can see

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,759
operations on resources that will

00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,860
trigger recently or they are scheduled

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,020
to be triggered so it's possible for

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,139
example for system that will be fine

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,659
reboot my j was a s over every night

00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:25,139
because I now it has memory on my

00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:26,430
application of the server itself and you

00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,270
can just carry food

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:33,170
like this and here we also have

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,960
hazardous or currently unavailable on

00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:41,580
list of things so its softness 4622 to

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,670
the knowledge so now when you take a

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:49,130
look at one platform for example that's

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:52,950
um my laptop is you a bunch of icons

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:55,710
when I go to the soul is present I guess

00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:59,550
in these items thank for some sub

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:01,560
systems within the system so you have

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:05,040
this little I can hear that looks like a

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,830
180 with exact rock it's about the

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:13,830
monitoring subsystem and you have the

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:16,020
alarm is this little low in fat yes

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,950
thank you thanks it's about the

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,800
inventory i will show you the subsystems

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:27,450
again the moment the flag for adults

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,910
this display packing operations this

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,370
thing which looks like an explorer I

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:36,900
convenience or i can is about a Content

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,920
subsystem as the content and this one I

00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:43,950
don't

00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:46,620
the moment so you can also see here the

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:49,650
wrench is about configuring with us you

00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,170
can see not every resource has all of

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,510
the items that depends on the clock

00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:57,300
interview right and how much you want to

00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:00,300
support in the plugin sometimes it makes

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,610
no sense to configure a resource because

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,490
of a platform for noobs machine itself

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,040
of course i'd like to see host before

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:12,180
machine itself it very often makes no

00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,040
sense to configure it so it's to help

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,520
our chips that you just are monitoring

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:22,800
and has no chi to drop load values into

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:32,000
it we don't have a configure item so

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:32,000
let's go back to my platform perhaps

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,630
so

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:44,720
I think I got many of these unavailable

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:46,880
icons the red icons are you to do a new

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,080
network address that i just got property

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,490
asian here system because the system

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,470
expects the same hoes to be at the same

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,600
place that does it economically in a

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,660
production environment you could have

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,780
fixed IP addresses for delta T so this

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,270
hungry h each resource has a summary

00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,940
page so you can sort of a dashboard for

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:13,280
that resource the series greasy

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,120
measurement values head for the last

00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:20,180
long after measured and little unruh on

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,670
how it developed in the past you see a

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,870
list of under-earth and how severe they

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:29,270
were so it's medium low or high priority

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:33,100
some part of our metrics and show that

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:35,630
in a minute some configuration options

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,640
casino so nothing happened here our

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,480
packages packages ARMA have loaded into

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:44,329
something

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:49,339
okay some samples go here for you swap

00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:53,449
space for each metric you can have

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:59,120
grasped small brass and then about ron's

00:09:53,449 --> 00:10:04,329
like this and the system is calculating

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:08,870
balance between those metrics normally a

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:12,019
measure default value so low so it gets

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:15,050
the last end days of data and computes

00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:18,380
the balance and now when the value is

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:22,250
going on overload about it will trigger

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:26,420
on out of bound exemptions on and is a

00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:28,940
show because very often you know the

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:32,420
active sweat count is between for your

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,779
application between 70 and 80 and if it

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:39,589
if this one goes up to 120 you know it's

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:43,220
an error condition it's even possible to

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:47,709
unlock them on this thing out of bounds

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,709
or our path by a certain percentage

00:10:52,990 --> 00:11:01,600
so this is the default one into our

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:04,120
tablet so by default when a monitoring

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,310
system subsystem to implement in the

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,890
blocking that you want to monitor on

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,170
your values and then you give them into

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,330
little bit of code and it all the values

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:17,980
then that can please get automatically

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:21,910
draft in young this is 480 de janeiro

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,560
you have two algorithms to confuse the

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,399
right percentage so that you don't we

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:30,459
climb to a value range but it's sort of

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:34,029
defaulting to assist us we can also have

00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:35,940
tables if you say well I'm i wanna want

00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:43,140
to know the exact million effects

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:43,140
maximum values then then the graph and

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:51,279
now we have something in addition to the

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:54,580
funeral American values these are

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:59,230
so-called trains trait always considered

00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:01,870
as string values and when the system is

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,120
taking them it compares them with the

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:07,510
previous trade value and you are the

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,579
same nothing no new record step stored

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,370
in the database in a database only

00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:15,100
stores updated version when this rate

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:18,030
changes so for example when operating

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,250
system update comes in content

00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:24,620
Tenzing sweet this great value will

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:28,530
change anyone see when it has changed

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:30,990
about the direct database size for

00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:34,590
monitoring theta anybody we are

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:37,260
compressing theta so where each one our

00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,570
aggregate six-hour aggregates and one

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,480
day aggregates we can keep that body for

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:46,110
up to a year so you database won't

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,020
explode approaching the rotted off and

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:51,270
have and keep the compressed form so you

00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,990
get still a very good overview what

00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:59,570
happening in the past without all the

00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:03,720
future model data okay then Matthew

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:06,570
chapter 49 bility so you see one teacher

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:10,590
resource go up and down and watch how

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:14,550
many failures have for many and things

00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:16,410
like that also free resource and the

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:21,240
last countenance attack for the

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:25,740
schedules on this tab you specify which

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:29,150
of the metrics that the plug-in offers

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,400
for this specific resource type for this

00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:35,130
necklace that for example he wants to

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:39,710
measure and how often in which in the

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:42,750
well if you have ten platforms you can I

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:45,690
will set a default so that gets applied

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,120
to when you form a new platform unhooded

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,880
on a complete group of resources you

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,250
don't have to go into each one of it but

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,450
you can still over by our trust Vsauce

00:13:53,250 --> 00:14:04,260
them okay

00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:06,510
the inventory tapia that some of you

00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,420
hear about time what's the name of your

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:12,990
resource and then which direct children

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:17,100
does it have that's really not that much

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:19,890
of interest for from platform one thing

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:23,610
that's more interesting is Don Young

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:26,010
that you can manually add resources that

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,790
then do not get all of this covered in

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:32,940
my case he on my machine is the postgres

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:36,630
they erase over because plugin expects

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:39,149
some arms some default values which are

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:43,950
just not straight my machine but I can

00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:47,579
still go in say ok at voice vessel in

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:51,329
then on the next page here you specify

00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:54,180
connection properties and when you did

00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:57,360
the right thing it will just be taken

00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,180
into event we and all its child we

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,699
sausage shop databases on the database

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,899
server plus all the tables also get

00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,899
pulled in into inventory

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:19,070
so Alicia later on so the moment

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,890
operations will be the last some types

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:25,400
of you have again your resource type

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:28,670
various operations that you can execute

00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:33,080
so for example the grossest list for a

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:38,030
units machine the next step is specify

00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:41,440
when patients are either can execute

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:45,620
immediately this is damn triggering an

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,140
action on the actual resource remotely

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,910
source so it is all the same box of

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,140
course but if I had two boxes it would

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:57,380
reach out on the other box and execute

00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:00,500
operation on it we can also specify a

00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,900
different star time and recurrence how

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,660
often do we want to take the piglet and

00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:09,040
when shoot it in so it's really like

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:14,270
liking from you can just say okay let's

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,910
every hour or every day or whatever then

00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:21,880
you click on schedule the period just

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,880
once click on schedule

00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:30,739
we are completely populations can't go

00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:36,179
in click on it and here you see the

00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:38,519
results it's probably in a different

00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:41,279
format than what you would expect we

00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:45,480
just know the output of PS lines

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:49,949
whatever but it's still useful and it's

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:53,149
just one example of what you can do when

00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:56,579
I'm going back here on the summary tab

00:16:53,149 --> 00:17:01,279
you also see our visibility on the swiss

00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:08,339
corporation and then there is this on

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:12,360
timeline in here where you can also see

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:16,220
on a more graphical you what happened

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,220
with your system so

00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:28,209
the scene was down young this red bar

00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:30,039
his life red paw here we did have an

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:33,669
operation with the green check mark

00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:35,919
which means what's it was successful and

00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:37,899
when you would get the events in they

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,720
will show up on earth would show up in

00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:44,409
here so it's actually the seemingly

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,549
timeline project from MIT that so it's

00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:50,980
very cool on your display or so

00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:54,580
timelines it's really helpful written in

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:58,869
java script so it's sometimes a bit

00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:00,879
hairy when you supply the wrong data or

00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:04,720
not exactly in the former center

00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:07,450
expected especially one you have those

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,350
trench things like Joan who loads in

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:15,070
your system time zones which are not us

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:19,230
but when you run around that it's really

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:21,249
a cool I believe here in the cream

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,669
something that you are currently working

00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:27,519
on you can again cross through your

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:30,879
resources till it's only just one

00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,590
platform that you see when you want to

00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:34,960
go to another platform you have at the

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:38,009
moment to go to the parts are with your

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,009
resources menu

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:45,480
mission said I'm heavy

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:50,279
Russian and then just select other

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:58,879
platforms when you go on a resource in

00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:58,879
here like for example you can

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,780
also right nada

00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:10,039
find a different one

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,429
ok so we are currently working on the

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:29,210
screen and revamping it so it looks like

00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:32,399
to like fix Apophis currently disabled

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:38,070
so it should grow in the next version of

00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:40,169
you get out there so one other thing if

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,230
we have you have seen we have this

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:45,870
summary page curry sauce and we have to

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,299
dashboard but often that's not enough so

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,580
if you want to know about other time

00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:54,029
results all about your system or which

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,129
one is it's the worst outlier it's a bit

00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:58,230
hard to click on each resource and to

00:19:56,129 --> 00:20:02,669
compare them by hand so what we also

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:04,590
have here so far sub system views where

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,639
you have for various things like

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:11,070
evaluation changes metrics informations

00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:13,860
of you about this subsystem of the whole

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:17,309
system so here the support suspect

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:21,149
network switches are these outliers they

00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:23,759
are now sorted by out of range vector

00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:27,360
and the one which is the worst outliers

00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:31,830
this chart on top so you know on what to

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:35,909
concentrate so it's easy and here you

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:38,549
can also go and operations you see all

00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:42,450
the operations that happened during an

00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:45,070
armed some sometimes of it make it

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:50,220
further or one resource what happened

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:54,190
this one so no big deal at the moment

00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:57,820
this is a two histories life that I was

00:20:54,190 --> 00:21:02,610
talking about in we started actually in

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:05,529
2006 with the current line of

00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:09,820
programming and early two thousand eight

00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:13,380
will beat average q1 which was the

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:17,620
framework and most of the bits of it but

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:21,789
not the Java part which was small it was

00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:25,990
still closed off at that time then here

00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:28,659
in end of 2008 we released our sku on

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:31,179
one generous on to LeBron James

00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:33,220
operations network product and after

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:36,789
that also the drop of its out this one

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:40,000
plus that one sort of gave this one and

00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:43,059
then we had these two online of

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,669
development one of the results that came

00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:48,820
out of that was also a method Johan

00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:53,669
which many of you go we have seen as the

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,669
embedded console in applications / 5 and

00:21:54,029 --> 00:22:01,360
currently we are you want on screen and

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:04,389
in September last year around finally

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,379
able to put those chopped up to the 3

00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:11,429
plus bills into our HQ one got four so

00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:15,029
it's one unified sauce line we release

00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:19,870
community release of one God for build

00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:23,320
01 and in this build we had some issues

00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:27,039
with people that want to upgrade from

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:29,409
previous versions of Java to that

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:33,639
version because of a concern consider

00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:37,720
the tulips we worship logins as you are

00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:40,059
then the longest war version plugins so

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,759
we decided in the process yes we are

00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:44,889
putting some different emphases more

00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:48,100
emphasis on the whole development and

00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:50,620
also about Justin a compatibility with

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:54,190
the Russian numbers that's an excellent

00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:56,919
now HQ will be our HQ sweet and last

00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:00,700
week we release the second community

00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:06,399
version of it our HQ three dots road

00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:09,220
built to which s-curve plugins and this

00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:12,039
is now availa development how HQ three

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,639
we don't ever mistake yet but we plan

00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:19,510
our East on giving out community

00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:23,919
releases every every six weeks the two

00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:26,409
months and it's expected that from our

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,120
HQ sweet you will also get the next

00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:32,159
version of Chavez authorship we'll

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,159
probably meet Jo some sweet as well

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:42,710
so after this history of you give quick

00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:45,680
architecture overview the central team

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:49,490
and we have here is the average user or

00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:53,180
laptop devil so when you want to do load

00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:56,150
balancing or fade over you can have one

00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,160
on walk service in your data center it's

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:02,390
even possible if you have two data

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:05,090
centers to have one each or two ath and

00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:08,410
then have so-called affinity groups that

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:12,350
when an agent come to that in a minute

00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:14,600
is talking to one data center and or one

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,240
so in one datacenter and this song is

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,040
going down that we try to talk with

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,050
others own in the data center before

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:27,200
switching over to gather data center

00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:29,900
which is normally not wanted so on the

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,760
server you have access for the

00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,760
administrator is to do it

00:24:48,270 --> 00:25:02,090
and we can drive expression each other

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:08,110
conversely it even has Auto completion

00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:09,970
or or some germs or resource names and

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:12,790
and other stuff so it's quite

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,679
comfortably and quite powerful and then

00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,690
we have experimental support for web

00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,450
death so you can mount your whistle

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:22,740
street as a vector directory in your

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:25,390
Explorer or find the hole where the

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,290
server hosts also the database

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:33,100
connection before database fast

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:36,549
post-press and Oracle there is some

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:39,309
support from h2 database gets an

00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:42,610
embedded one which basically the success

00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:47,830
of which was called hypersonic in the

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:50,410
past this is mainly used for demoing or

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:52,750
testing purposes not for production and

00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,140
then there is some experimental small

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:58,100
pasiba so

00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:01,310
once it was over and he had a big

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:04,960
component that we have here that you

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:08,270
need tisk eh this dog a dashed line

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,330
shows the platform so on each platform

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,970
that you want to mourn it wrong and

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:16,880
manage staff you need an agent and this

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,100
agent gets all the asian plugins and

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,190
only is it should like it to talk to

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,770
your manager resources so in a fireball

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,900
scenario you only have to cut through

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,210
the communication between agent in

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,710
server but never between Scylla and

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,710
target managed resource

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:45,440
so yes I was talking a lot about

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:48,470
resources our definition of the resource

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,830
is everything that can be managed Oh

00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:56,330
Molly told I've written a plugin that

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:59,810
monitors at Alameda chip so it's just a

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:03,830
chemical sensor like a transistor on

00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:05,660
let's ice begins on the one y of us so

00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:11,480
here it's only monitoring and no

00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:16,280
managing but results could also be any

00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:18,800
process or sweat count or memory setting

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:24,020
anything like that and then each

00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:26,750
resource yes corresponding three soft

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:31,520
type a result I this place after dinner

00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:33,980
oh my god it's a generous AAS its

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:39,610
content it's an individual data source

00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:43,550
it's a database table things like that

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:46,460
and Anna last thing which we have is the

00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:48,950
resource category this is sort of show

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,230
us the place of inverter resource

00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:54,530
hierarchy you have seen before platform

00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:56,870
which is the machine then the next level

00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,330
is the server which could be for example

00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:03,020
Chavez application server it could be a

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:06,380
tomcat this whole thing is so few gossip

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:09,320
so again how is the server Jay was a s

00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:12,809
has embedded tomcat server as ragazza

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:16,210
and then usually below as well

00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:20,490
which is the data sold in general guess

00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:20,490
which is about application in tomcat

00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:28,360
this you know how goo on when you use

00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:33,070
the so I'm going to use the service

00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:37,090
usually like that you that when you have

00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:39,789
a subsystem or complete process we model

00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:42,009
it a disturber and when its individual

00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:46,320
part of the subsystem on the best

00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:48,540
service but if we like as usual

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:54,090
right

00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:56,640
okay let this coming up Jimmy and this

00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:59,670
is again showing this hierarchy which

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,770
who knows what I even platform services

00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:04,920
that are what hanging myself but

00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:08,790
directly off the bat for me like network

00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,920
interfaces okay then we have those

00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:14,850
subsystems I have showed it already

00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:18,510
kinder in the UI walkthrough so I'm not

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:21,690
going to mention it about again um it

00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:24,090
depends on what your plugin defines

00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:29,070
which of the subsystem is available for

00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:31,980
a specific resource type usually you

00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:35,220
want to do monitoring availability is

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:40,080
technically also a known subsystem but

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:44,040
it's a form of the monitoring Soloff so

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:47,070
enormous have some inventory but many

00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,900
resources just don't have any connection

00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,580
properties no nothing so you don't need

00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,570
to implement

00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,570
in there

00:29:52,909 --> 00:30:03,249
so I want to talk about extensibility of

00:29:56,149 --> 00:30:03,249
the whole thing we have now prospectus

00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:10,279
actually a la you can you can write

00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:13,039
server-side plugins that are running in

00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,590
this world and extent of functionality

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:21,139
one of the rest is the perspective

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:24,169
switch to a new do I look or you use it

00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:27,139
to the right and then we have the alert

00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:29,899
plugins that are other members and then

00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:33,340
you can write motivations those ancient

00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:37,460
writings don't go through all those now

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:41,269
perspectives gets like you are a plugin

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:44,389
so if possible to write complete new you

00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:46,489
ice cream because most of our tap life

00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:50,840
is monitoring went to me that you have

00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:54,409
seen just next to that in a new arch at

00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:58,309
this can be written in Java just normal

00:30:54,409 --> 00:31:00,879
10 it is or will be possible to you host

00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:00,879
the 14

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:07,070
with the PHP but that gets some

00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:09,409
information when it's called and that

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:13,549
can even also link back into the main

00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:17,029
URL corn wine we have various attention

00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:19,190
to itself it's possible to to check it

00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:22,099
to change increase in the top level menu

00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:26,829
you can add new tabs and you can write

00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:31,519
your pages or exchange existing changes

00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:34,609
then he asian plugins that's basically

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,499
the functionality those guys that talk

00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:39,559
to the Microsoft that work with the

00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:41,539
manage resource only those talk to me

00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:44,389
source of the month again so it

00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:47,839
basically we have must earn + some Java

00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:50,450
code the mega that the kind the

00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:53,570
capabilities of your plugin so when you

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:56,209
say I want to want to up those two three

00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,889
four values over the doors through three

00:31:56,209 --> 00:32:00,979
bubbles will be shown in the GUI

00:31:57,889 --> 00:32:05,110
schedules tap on an electronic am no

00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:08,060
matter how many data binding would throw

00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:12,110
da da da da also wires the Java classes

00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:17,150
together the bunion can already see our

00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:19,340
resources so it's possible when as I

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:21,710
said when you we saw that the tide is

00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:25,940
coming up then it gets automatically

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:27,830
added to the inventory and there's a

00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:31,550
generator available that can help you

00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:34,940
with riding upon him there is a big list

00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:39,920
of plugins available right now many of

00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:44,900
those and our HQ project indica- wrote

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:47,990
but also from service and witness

00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:52,430
stripped plug-in that can even differ

00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:55,370
and measurements taking to some scripts

00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:57,620
in JRuby or JavaScript so many

00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,900
administrators don't like writing Java

00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,480
code but still no scripting languages

00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:07,340
like Ruby you're well enough so even

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:10,620
that's possible ok

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,480
our family is the three boxes so you

00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:15,299
have to plug in this window you need to

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,330
like that that's a bit of XML you have

00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:21,330
to write discovery class that's so need

00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,460
to implement one message that the

00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:26,519
shortest where should just sort of

00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:29,190
Richard's its input and then the

00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,169
component class that defines all the

00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:36,570
facets for all the subsystems that you

00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:40,320
want to implement it and yeah so this is

00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:44,549
the quick runs of the plug-in generator

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,250
it's tengo Java archive it's asks a few

00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:50,429
questions here we want platforms of a

00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:53,880
service a huge of your resource screen

00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:55,769
from that plugin where shouldn't live in

00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,440
the package hierarchy where should we

00:33:55,769 --> 00:34:01,110
live in the file system so which club

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,840
which are at last names and now what

00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:05,309
subsystem do is want to support me wants

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,760
to walk event we want to support

00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:12,000
monitoring etc and when all of that is

00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:16,409
done it will write out a pom file from

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,780
the formation and a skeleton plugging

00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:22,169
this crypto is a few to root X in there

00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,419
and also scale the Java classes that are

00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:26,970
fully sucked out all the subsystems that

00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:29,609
we want to support so you can directly

00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:32,490
compile it and deploy it if you want you

00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:34,389
much of course but it's already a very

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:39,429
major again

00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:44,319
I have created a video which I hope will

00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:47,829
be online soon about how to do that also

00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:49,779
a lot of unlike article park now how to

00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:52,029
write a plug-in so there should be a lot

00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:55,750
of resources and of course that's the

00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:58,089
source code of the existing lions let's

00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:02,289
just release talk available asian

00:34:58,089 --> 00:35:05,069
plugins I don't want to go through that

00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:10,200
in detail this list is not exhaustive

00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:14,079
not if the sources to get we both

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,250
knowledge but there's you see big

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:21,069
support launch of jamo software Jay was

00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:23,769
ns5 support James cash we have fun a

00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:27,190
sleepy Trekkie so other devices like

00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:29,880
Reuters can send traps to the system

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:34,029
which get that incorporate in the event

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:38,049
subsystem we have a generic jmx server

00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:44,079
here which is which allows you to burn

00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:46,630
it off any java high resource and bring

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,829
the block codes in the past on how to

00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:52,380
monitor your Eclipse IDE

00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:58,430
to have of this gen x plugin so if

00:35:52,380 --> 00:36:01,319
that's possible and then outside of our

00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:05,459
domain there is a genius friend for the

00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:07,979
success of generous cash monitoring get

00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:11,459
smoked for mobile sites for the very

00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:14,369
start of Moby census support jboss esv

00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:17,430
my doctor just told me that there for

00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:19,910
their roots start some support and I'm

00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:25,309
sure there are more plugins out there

00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:28,680
that I don't know about so after the age

00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:31,440
plugins and managed resource monitor

00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,509
resource coming back to the server start

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,690
blogging about how to expand your serve

00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:39,779
on the server side plugins lupa the

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:41,609
server has been named seth and they

00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:44,729
basically had access to all server-side

00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:47,849
methods so it's possible for you to buy

00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:51,029
a plug-in that work some doing reports

00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:53,009
on all your resources or when in

00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:58,829
eventually it will try to read more

00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:59,660
about how many windows 2003 service do

00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:06,530
you have

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:08,569
things like that Google of my cues we

00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:11,450
recall the engine some time in the

00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:15,289
future hopefully but you could use it

00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:19,250
for those purposes again it's submitted

00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:21,650
an A+ java code and there are some

00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,380
different kinds of server-side plugins

00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:30,490
all of them have different gauhar that

00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:30,490
extend a base of some plug in XML format

00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:39,099
so you are one of the most useful for my

00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:43,039
height is yellow to end of the coming to

00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:46,240
all of us plugins are mounted sources we

00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:49,309
have for example in Jay goes Jay was HP

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,549
where customers can get updates foo

00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:55,069
young jay was a s service and this is

00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:58,670
also suicide plugin that's contacting

00:37:55,069 --> 00:38:01,369
with Rasmus model pulling her feet which

00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:05,089
is the changes and the cosmic and then

00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:07,569
say Jay goes on ok apply please apply

00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:12,130
those changes to my application zones

00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:12,130
it's also supported by so

00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:19,810
the other plugins are specialized for

00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:22,390
server-side plugins basically what you

00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:25,420
have to do is again right a little bit

00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:28,090
of XML and then implement this long

00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,880
message and your friend or consent and

00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:33,640
the argument that you get a little pep

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,250
talk about files and then you have to

00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:42,270
react on it we show an example on the

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:45,010
next slide nice thing is when we have

00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:48,850
preferences in the UI for the whole

00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:52,750
plugging so it's possible if you have it

00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:55,750
say I OC Senhor plugin let me set as the

00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:59,350
preference which I'll see so we want to

00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:02,440
contact and perhaps some credentials on

00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:04,690
how to contact that and then a little

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,680
specific will be for example if channel

00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:12,250
on this field should go to me I'll show

00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:14,260
that in the UI and these gets trust

00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:17,140
injectors we don't have to

00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:21,970
and you got to get those values they are

00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:23,950
just there for free what do I it's just

00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:27,550
driven by the mayor data web

00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:30,870
configuration system and this tremendous

00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:35,650
input fields for all of that which is

00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:38,980
powerful enough in many many cases but

00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:43,270
sometimes it's not enough when you want

00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:45,640
to do extensive searches or listing of

00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:50,020
boxes then it's still possible to write

00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:53,100
a custom UI you write an XHTML liver the

00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,780
bracelet plus the banking in Java

00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:59,440
package all of them together and then

00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:03,520
you have a custom URL also here we have

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,480
a script language alert Center where you

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,620
can define those message or the

00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,880
implementing method

00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:15,640
in JRuby Ruby and has this delivered

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,100
wire to be instead of having to write

00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,820
Java concerts again eating I guess to

00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:24,970
administrators this is a list of

00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:27,220
available adult animal plugins subjects

00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:31,150
and those subjects are just leave you

00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:36,310
some within the hour HQ serve and roads

00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:39,730
are things like Jay bus operators system

00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:41,650
operators or business people or

00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:45,010
something like that and they will just

00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:49,420
send email to those then we have Bobby

00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:51,970
Sands support so the plugin is talking

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:55,260
to a Bobby send soma which is then

00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:58,330
initiating a Royce call to you and

00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:02,140
towards the error message on the phone I

00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:06,430
did have in the past emotion waiver if

00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:10,270
you'll be able to do touch tones who are

00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:13,180
the back piece of legs after to report

00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:16,980
we put a resource this is currently not

00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:19,960
available in the plug-in version I still

00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:25,380
need to look for which idea on how to

00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:30,010
integrate it so you are free to help

00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:32,190
shop message 10 developer graph paper

00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:36,060
ration interface where you

00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:40,650
progress to an end point to send short

00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:43,650
messages then micro blog Twitter or

00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:45,240
thousand athletes that some interesting

00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:47,040
I guess when when you deploy a spy

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,130
business server was in your enterprise

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,339
and we can just have their twitter

00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:57,210
client talk to the palace net so and get

00:41:53,339 --> 00:42:00,000
the update from there as well he where

00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:05,010
is just email sending to anyone we can

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:09,630
then send SNMP traps and also talk to

00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:12,900
ioc have a bottom is edith called

00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:15,480
reporting alerts and again the script

00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:17,490
language and one thing that we did have

00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,400
an older version but which currently

00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:23,430
vanished in the operation in the other

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,609
plug-in version is the operation center

00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:28,890
that you can trigger an operation like

00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:31,800
we have seen an hour cherry sauce in

00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:35,180
your inventory so it will be possible if

00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:39,569
you find out that the data soft sauce is

00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,710
running at full connections for full of

00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:43,980
which i'm even if you

00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:45,359
expect 540 connections at a time you can

00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,630
look like something we preach the whole

00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,900
application server you think that's a

00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:54,750
good idea to fix this problem okay

00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:58,800
that's a quick look plugin example so

00:42:54,750 --> 00:43:02,160
that's the wiring you write this plug-in

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,710
the script or it's a quick shot up day

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,589
off because of all these xml namespace

00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,510
and also that you have to implement

00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:12,710
which I don't want to show you so

00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:15,510
basically you have to define a name and

00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:17,869
you can define a package that's just a

00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:20,730
job package where your code lives in and

00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:24,780
don't have to specify it your plug in

00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:27,030
class later on here in this block some

00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,869
of knocking cannot plug in configuration

00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:36,359
you specify the preferences that's all

00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:39,869
its office and then down here a lot

00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:42,839
configuration is other properties that

00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:44,730
are specific for one its den see a shin

00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,910
of focusing and we were showing in a

00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:49,250
meaningful

00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:52,099
we need to provide a short name of the

00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:55,520
center which get so shown when you want

00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:57,980
to define a new alert notification you

00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,500
select for list consent laws and that's

00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,650
the short name then you will see the

00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:09,319
Java code for the words in here is again

00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:12,859
this package how did class you are we

00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:15,589
have this message sent here you just

00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:17,930
defined your Java code I'm getting my

00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:20,599
lair from preferences for the preference

00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:25,490
eagerly this is there for you you say

00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:29,079
get simple simple value host name is the

00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:32,450
one will be fine metal otter and this

00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:36,529
second argument is the default value if

00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:38,930
the operator the use of people enter

00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:41,480
anything which are specified default

00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:45,230
value the same here and your paralegal

00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:48,500
deathmatch part so today is chest area

00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:51,650
only this one method call to get it we

00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,770
are opening my HTTP URL connection to

00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,599
that host and port while getting our

00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:58,880
caucus cream and providing my my

00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:02,960
sections with simplified of course and

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:06,040
at the end when you are done you need to

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,440
which was central result object

00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:12,320
descending whistle object expects that

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,590
you specified was the most successful or

00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,960
failure and a message and then has

00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:22,880
birthday not shown on this slide which

00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:24,970
is if your email which means this dragon

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,760
just computed a list of email addresses

00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:33,320
that should be sent off it's not able to

00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:37,280
determine if sending will be successful

00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:40,100
later because that's only done after all

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,590
the email addresses having collected so

00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,810
this plugin kind of know it and like any

00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:49,090
does not have to implement is sending

00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:49,090
because it is just available for

00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:56,590
fighters okay so close to the entrance

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,250
it's okay

00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:07,410
you see here that's in this plugin that

00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:11,099
part i have just minor modifications I

00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:13,619
have this movie sense said no I can show

00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:17,160
it outside later on if anyone was good

00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:20,519
to see it hear that a lot configuration

00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:23,249
how it was down here under on the xml

00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:29,249
spirit so that's just a default when

00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:32,339
hearing and here you add your value what

00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:35,339
is Rhodes plugging we have discussed

00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:37,829
from you I to see more as nice as the

00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:40,259
provided one but this is a little bit

00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:42,420
more complex with those big house where

00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:44,309
you can put start from left to right and

00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,769
it just gives on the left lift that list

00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:49,109
and get through life on so this is not

00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:52,820
come so you can just write as you want

00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:58,730
and then last thing

00:46:52,820 --> 00:47:01,610
which plugins so here's the list of

00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:10,280
asian and server-side lemons let's just

00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:14,000
go into one solar mocha sense one so

00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:16,490
here that this box is this global

00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,320
configuration section it was up in the

00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:26,390
xml limits again random for you okay

00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:29,690
some URLs for you our excuse moi it has

00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:34,370
gorgeous to all of yours because then my

00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:36,920
blog I'm talking about our HQ and how to

00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:40,310
extend it on how to do things so if you

00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,430
are interested it's something I want to

00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:47,330
follow and then you have chambers but

00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:50,360
this speech this RSS aggregator feed

00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:54,350
aggregator so all of our feeds into in

00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:59,360
mind hot how HQ will be fed into that

00:47:54,350 --> 00:48:02,090
morning so thanks for listening and I
