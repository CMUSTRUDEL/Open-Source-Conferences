Description: 
	By Heiko Rupp

Jopr is the open source systems management and monitoring platform from JBoss / Red Hat. While it is specially tailored towards JBoss projects, it can be easily extended in various ways.

This talk will present the Jopr / RHQ system and its architecture and then talk about the extension points and how to write extensions for monitoring, management and alerting.

This presentation will also talk about the relation to RHQ-project.org, which used to be the upstream to Jopr and which now includes the Jopr bits.
