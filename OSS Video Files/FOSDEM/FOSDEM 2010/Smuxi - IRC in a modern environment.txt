Title: Smuxi - IRC in a modern environment
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2010
Description: 
	By Mirco Bauer

Smuxi is an advanced IRC client that solves the "always available" problem in a graphical environment, providing a graphical alternative to the popular text-based ssh + irssi + screen combination.

In this talk, I will present the current functionality of Smuxi and discuss plans for the future.


FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

for infants and I was like sorry

00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:46,000
attention tension he looks I'm Nick wall

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:49,360
I'm a Devon boba and one of my pet

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,040
projects of the spicy primer which are

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:57,850
working on phantoms of Segovia my span

00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,760
tag off the area that is and I want to

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:05,549
introduce smacking each na cuz i have

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,549
been working on the past few years and

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,240
and

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,530
so what is maximum smacks is the user

00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:26,280
for the IRC client at the first glance

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:33,460
it's cross-platform that means runs

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:37,240
linux freebsd also windows mac OS x also

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,700
plans but it's not stalling it no this

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:45,310
one smacks envelop are using it already

00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:52,030
on Mac OS X but this little I yet that's

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:56,170
coming right now smacks as a non-friend

00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:59,319
front end as primarily front end other

00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,959
products also plans but I'm focusing on

00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:05,470
the genome for that for now because I

00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:07,929
want one usable and finished front edge

00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:13,750
instead of having many front ends and

00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:16,209
all I unusable smacks in space on the

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:20,610
client-server model this makes it very

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,610
special compared to other I see clients

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:34,120
you could say or compare it to the IRS

00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:37,380
se+ screen plus s/h combination but like

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:46,480
I said before it's known based or low

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:50,019
focused not text like ICS and at its

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,959
core maxi is basically a mass action

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:56,970
framework it doesn't care about

00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:03,430
protocols it doesn't care about views

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:08,939
it's about messaging the engine

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:12,250
smacks is rich that means all the

00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:15,640
message processing on the protocol

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:19,480
handling whatever is happening on the

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:23,700
engine side and the front ends that

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:27,909
connects to that engine and display the

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:31,959
data from the engine is lean that means

00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:34,569
in the front ends not many features of

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,919
piloted only the future that are needed

00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:44,590
for the presentation for the view of the

00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:48,430
engine features and has already said

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:51,310
it's / control because it's a messaging

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:55,239
framework basically that means that can

00:03:51,310 --> 00:04:00,040
handle any protocols that are message

00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:04,810
oriented message based right now I am

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:07,900
limited iousy support and also you know

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,879
disasterous twitter that philip i

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:16,150
finished the true to support some weeks

00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:18,849
ago it was more kind of fun project at

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,430
the idea why the web front end of

00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:25,720
Twitter's not that nice can I use

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:28,389
Twitter from smack see directly and in

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,020
two days I had the Twitter support and

00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:35,139
that was kind of proof of concept that

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:38,409
the messaging framework the protocol

00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:41,919
neutral part is really working because I

00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:45,389
could adopt it very quickly to a

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,389
completely different protocol

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:53,219
this is actual why Starbase this maxi

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:58,509
project for what reason I mean we have

00:04:53,219 --> 00:05:00,369
so many artisan clients out there I can

00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,549
have them all they are just too much

00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:05,199
every programmer on this planet has

00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:10,419
probably written already annoy RC

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:15,069
clients everyone but that does mean they

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:20,049
are good so I wrote smack see I tried

00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:22,389
different I see clients say five to ten

00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:26,049
or something well basically all internal

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:31,299
clients I could find on apt but with a

00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:37,139
PT and I couldn't really get used to any

00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:40,539
of those so i sticked with IRS SI and

00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:44,319
yeah you use it for a while a few years

00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:48,759
but but then I thought well some things

00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:55,289
are not the way I would like yeah I

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:55,289
prefer chocolate so I went with Maxie

00:05:55,649 --> 00:06:06,959
quite for example you have to use all or

00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:13,239
see other languages I don't like for

00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:15,399
extending an IRS I i prefer c sharp for

00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:18,189
example X as programming language it was

00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,379
also reason why I decided to write smack

00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:27,579
see at the time there was no other I a

00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:30,129
sick night Brittany shop also most

00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:32,379
clients yeah they are written by

00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:35,349
programs like every program that somehow

00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:37,700
and comes to ISE programmers believe

00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:40,070
that suffer should have complicated

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,040
and difficult to use I don't know why

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:48,140
but that's my impression when I see a

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:51,710
regular IC client so and yeah like I

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:55,510
said IRS aside for screen great solution

00:06:51,710 --> 00:07:01,880
but no guey that's which I didn't like

00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:06,830
and so it didn't didn't integrate at all

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:12,020
my guest experience which is no and yeah

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:18,440
well of course hanging is fun so I snuck

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:21,430
see some special features our goals of

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,350
the smug six lines are the following

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,870
first it's cross-platform that's not the

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,930
accident that was a goal I want to now

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:33,320
see clients that runs a different

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,890
platforms so users are not limited to

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,350
pick a one platform they can choose the

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,780
flattened they prefer or even switch the

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,430
two platforms say at work you have to

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:50,600
use a different operating system that at

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:53,770
home or whatever also the major feature

00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:57,080
of smack since that architecture that

00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:00,550
their engine component can run on a

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,980
different computer then the front end

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:07,250
the front and then can connect to that

00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:11,240
running engine inside this maxi Sarah

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:15,350
over the network but this does mean I

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,690
said simple client as max can be used as

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:21,260
a rebel a standalone client you can also

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,390
stops maxi and connects you to IRC and

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:28,390
you are done in just using it you are no

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:33,440
se that simple so doesn't have to be a

00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:37,340
client-server model but candy yeah and

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,880
smack see is a multi-protocol with

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:43,790
Twitter finally from the beginning

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,830
smacks he wasn't is eccentric but I see

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,350
was the most important protocol I need

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:52,160
for my daily communication with a heck

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,840
of a project and also at work and yeah

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,150
like I headed Twitter support because

00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,990
i'm also using that instead of your

00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:02,480
usual of blogging smacks he has a

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:05,270
computer interface that means you can

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,950
set up where the topic is whether the

00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:11,750
taps go well the user list is or you

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,870
don't know but what do we use a list and

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,630
all that and also a very nice feature

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,360
which i like is not seen any other

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:24,980
client at the unique new colors that

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:29,600
means smacks is picking new color based

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:32,390
on a hash from the nickname means you

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,190
get a color say ping four-door attacks

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:39,410
and regardless where he is in regardless

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,600
of which channel or in which protocol

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,600
he's called directx so he's paying

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,370
well it makes it easier to recognize

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:54,020
people to call at least for me than by

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:58,490
cryptical nicknames so yeah that's a

00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:01,310
nasty future oh my goodness so at once

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,589
part of smack see the development is

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:07,640
very actual slightly different new

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:10,040
developers joined the project one of

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,950
them is working i identical support

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,560
because right now really twitter is

00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,899
working not at Attica and i right

00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,200
identica has a twitter comfortable RP

00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:24,980
but it's not supported yet we still

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:29,260
can't forget that also plant is a

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:32,600
peasant message buffers that means say

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:35,660
you have to close or kill your smexy

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,770
server it means carefully you lose your

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,750
old messages but that's usual problems

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,959
IRC clients there's no consensus

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:48,440
anything so whats max is going to do

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:51,440
next is whilst all those messages and

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,570
they'll like wear database a SQLite and

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,660
if you will start the smartest server

00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,250
then old messages will be reloaded into

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:03,890
the bath house and yard not losing any

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:07,040
messages and you can go back in history

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:11,350
of all discussions and everything is

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,320
there's also cycas integration planned

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:17,959
I'm contact with one of the developers

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,160
for sokka's integration I don't know if

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:24,020
you know sad guys it's an activity

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:31,810
tracker basically and smacks you will

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:31,810
send in the future events to cyclized

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,630
subtracts activity on it and with also

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,100
plan is a framework using moment

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:45,270
ends current lease Maxie has no

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,970
standardized plugins system if you

00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:52,420
handcrafted self-written plug-in system

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:55,840
for the would you protocol support but

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:58,060
it's it has no public up yet which

00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:05,940
plugins officially you can use so it

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:05,940
could break with every powerful yeah

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:13,120
Appa date I'm planning also a login

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,740
frame with a logging framework that's an

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,990
important feature that's currently

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:20,890
missing on smile means down the right

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:23,890
any log files so if you want to track or

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,650
even we meet all discussions currently

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:29,050
there are no locks for that I know every

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,930
client does that smacks about yet but

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:34,630
they have up today they're up to today

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,850
there was no real demand for such

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,730
feature so and I don't know how much

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,490
people really would be reading it anyhow

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:47,170
I will Department it because yes the

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:49,450
news I could see it and one word after

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:54,370
that I plan to add java support also

00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:56,550
known as XMPP the protocol and at that

00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:01,060
point smacks it will become true

00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:03,040
multi-protocol which yeah it is

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,730
currently awesome much for the call but

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:12,700
I mean to us not there feature-rich that

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:16,750
was quite simple compared to that so

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:19,300
after all this talking I will try to get
