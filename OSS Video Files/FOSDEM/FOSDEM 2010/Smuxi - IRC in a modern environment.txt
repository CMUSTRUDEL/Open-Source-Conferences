Description: 
	By Mirco Bauer

Smuxi is an advanced IRC client that solves the "always available" problem in a graphical environment, providing a graphical alternative to the popular text-based ssh + irssi + screen combination.

In this talk, I will present the current functionality of Smuxi and discuss plans for the future.
