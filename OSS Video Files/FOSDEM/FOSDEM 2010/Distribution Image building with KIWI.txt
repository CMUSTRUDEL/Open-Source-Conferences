mm of the offensive team actually and

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:12,870
I'm talking today about a tool mostly

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:19,800
used for urban sources of file called te

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:22,289
it's for creating system images so yeah

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,810
what is TV I also gave a short

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,410
explanation first of all it's a command

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:35,070
line tool so it's fully into trouble cds

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:40,770
or dvds that are fully run runnable

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:42,180
without installation on your system in

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,230
the meanwhile it's also possible to

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:52,440
create the installation repositories so

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:56,550
the regular school dvds and maybe a web

00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,539
of this is to do is a appliance creation

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,750
tool web-based a colleague of mine later

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,450
ever talk about it and yeah it's the

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,670
back and fight and there's also I just

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,180
maybe you know yes or system

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:17,220
configuration tool I just graphically do

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,049
so in the face for it like so you can if

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,909
you don't want to use from online and

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:28,439
stick em at a graphical version of it so

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:31,500
what is an image much like this one it's

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,380
more or less these kind of images TV

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,960
supports creating of all these types of

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:42,720
system images I also mentioned already

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:46,229
mentioned the life CD or dvd same from

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,530
booting from USB sticks or we use be hot

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:55,670
rice you can also have an onium hard

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:59,790
disk image means you can have a sippy

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,979
epic hard disk image to simply DD on a

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,030
harddrive and you can mount it to a

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,550
computer and everything will be running

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:12,150
so for Network beautiful images peaks II

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,640
for example little

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:19,530
gene images like you a row and the area

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:26,939
are supported also for sin and these ec2

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:30,689
amazon stuff so what are you how is it

00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:34,920
how it's in how are these images useful

00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:38,489
for you maybe for example if you want to

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,220
distribute use software maybe in an open

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,590
source project under the program

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:49,019
proprietary project running a limits so

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:51,239
we can create a false Arnold DVD the

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,299
viewer software already installed and

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,720
free configured simply tease people did

00:02:54,299 --> 00:03:01,819
your customers or your users can

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,920
evaluate yourself now you can actually

00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:08,730
pre-configure every time so it's running

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:13,109
out of the box you can create rescue

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:15,239
systems for example USB stick may I can

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:20,849
boot from to restore you of maybe

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:24,060
backups from elsewhere and yeah as I

00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:27,480
already mentioned to pre-install a

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,310
linear system on many machines for

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,720
example if your system administrator and

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:38,069
have a computer pool maybe and a

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:41,060
university with 20 or 30 machines all

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:43,829
the same or maybe even not the same

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:52,409
simply DD an image on it and we had a

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:58,409
running system so I must show you on a

00:03:52,409 --> 00:04:01,470
short example how to use GV it basically

00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:04,590
needs only three steps so you haven't

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,930
given it ready first of all you have to

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,629
create at the scripture means a

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,810
configuration file where you describe

00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:16,739
what you want that on the image then

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:20,940
Iran keeley to prepare the fastest of

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:22,840
tree so it's well as the same is being

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,580
running system

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:32,169
and the steps please create the image in

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:35,260
the type r you described before so if

00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:37,720
you want to add a diesel particulate or

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,090
whatever and you don't have to if you

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,060
want one that's more than one image tab

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:52,690
you only have to prepare it once so you

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:55,720
can create more images from it so what

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,940
explanation about the first step it's

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:04,020
more less simply a directory when I put

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:07,030
all the stuff you need for your image a

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,720
and then is basically exit and xml file

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:15,550
that contains for example a package

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:18,789
lists and maybe some services you need

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:22,630
for your image and some of those

00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:24,639
optional stuff you can many of it make

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,979
to manipulations of to your image on

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:33,100
different stages between the lingering

00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:35,500
the boot process i fully expect can also

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,180
contain still be files if you want to

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,960
add on the image and it may be out of

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:47,500
packaged in the RPM package or Ginny and

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:49,780
I get welcome there are also files that

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,639
you may have maybe it does not have any

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,220
running system but only in the in the

00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:58,389
distribution media but someone on an

00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,160
installation CD you have licensing files

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:04,780
or something in the root tree but you

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:10,990
will not have them in the system yet

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:13,270
running after those and in the organs of

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:19,210
the case for this yes to first boot

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:22,919
configuration if you will use this your

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,840
food we have to first good tool to

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,810
configurations on the running system on

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,810
the first group so if your customers

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,229
putting your huge then maybe have

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,830
different audio hardware the us just to

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:43,030
first food

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:45,460
for you so usually it's a bit boring to

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:49,050
show huge configuration files and

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,550
presentation however for this example

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:55,450
that is part of a included in the

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,490
documentation of TV not only this one

00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,670
there are many different use cases into

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:04,120
it it only needs about 40 lines of

00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:08,410
description to have a motion superslim

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,250
lights either image prepared and these

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,380
are basically these 14 answered

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,290
everything is prepared an image

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,690
container and for example yes some meter

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,360
description quite the author is a

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:27,120
original order of key piece might

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:31,860
shatter I'm doing the presentation and

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:36,100
describe your age give it a name and

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:42,640
yeah you're also kind of a long

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:44,590
explanation point is no internet here so

00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,620
we have of course preferences of your

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:50,950
system so different image types have

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,070
different settings so in this case we

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:59,440
only have the image tab consume

00:07:53,070 --> 00:08:06,580
intuitive so if that is already prepared

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:09,070
and in TV included food image you can

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,630
give the version and you can use

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,210
different energy managers in this case

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,610
we're using the susan food super to

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,910
install all the ARP on packages you can

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:21,460
also use smart for that that supports is

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:28,090
it may be known also non-rem

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:29,950
distributions or at least libyan some

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:34,720
other configuration files on the key

00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:39,940
table to make it thick for the keyboard

00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:42,190
you expect to use them to be using you

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,400
can define users in this case we only

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,470
have a routine so

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:51,320
you can prepare the password for this

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:55,630
user in an encrypted hashed way you can

00:08:51,320 --> 00:09:02,120
of course also as usual as regular users

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:04,820
pre-configure just differences between

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,230
all these images will be the software

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:11,510
that is installed on them so we have

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,910
first of all you to define a system

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,040
repository where all your program

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:20,860
negatives are starved before the

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:23,780
installation in this case we are using

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,430
the this is a shortcut for open

00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,640
resources before the openSUSE

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:32,420
installation repositories phone line

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,640
basically installation over HTTP let's

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,760
shop is open to the park on the shabbos

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:42,080
p all of it and as you can see we have

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,300
play a little to do repository where the

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:51,260
all the packages for the installation of

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:53,600
the energy will be you can also use

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,000
local file systems may be up a lot of

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,480
DDT with all the audience of it or your

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:08,810
effort each town is downloaded already

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:11,410
is free there's also file and local time

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,410
I 3 is actually

00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,610
so the next part is you selectively

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:25,240
packets as you order to install they are

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:28,990
basically three types of oh yeah in this

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,150
case I won two types of editors this is

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,330
a pattern this is something that is

00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:37,240
specifically for opensuse that is

00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:41,110
because it's bigger that's the reason

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,390
why this prefix by opensuse and we have

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:49,000
simple patterns may default editor means

00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:51,670
that is the mini mail system you need to

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,720
have a running opensuse so it's an

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:58,240
actual a collection of packages when you

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,520
can select additional packages for

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,840
example this package will be whenever

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:07,600
they need to honors and if you want life

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,970
and you can manipulate share the

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,060
packages are you can where you need them

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:15,640
for someone in this case you needed in

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,680
the in the food system because it's

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,760
lipids that frightening so that your

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,300
image is starting already with an

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,300
open-source graphics

00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:35,309
so that's all for the config.xml file

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,459
there are also some shell script in this

00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:41,670
case you only need this project SH that

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:43,319
does after all the packages installed in

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:48,569
this change food environment it is

00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:50,939
actually accused potential you need a

00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:52,999
script you can do anything you can do in

00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:58,019
a shell script so you can manipulate

00:11:52,999 --> 00:12:00,149
files you can find some in this case and

00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:05,040
tell me about this is open to the image

00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:08,100
there are some surfaces enables the

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,069
round level that is used for putting up

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,920
so put in this case up to around

00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:18,689
allergy-free only effectiveness of epic

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:22,230
system and also a source of purposes the

00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:24,329
city of azusa conflict to do this custom

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,399
configuration with it this is fully

00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:30,119
configurable so if you don't want to use

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:41,999
the Susa system don't run out on Suzy

00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:50,160
config file some so after we created the

00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:53,249
configuration for our system the actual

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,389
file system free is filled up and this

00:12:53,249 --> 00:13:02,249
is what how or when TD appears first it

00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:04,290
is then yo any DS two parameters three

00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:07,769
valleys the previous we are calling it

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:15,779
in the previous back first step there's

00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:17,970
a flood step is whether you need a

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:21,119
directly for that where to store all the

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:28,829
packages not the package is very solid

00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:32,940
and so it makes it up is the description

00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:35,340
we have we have prepared before and

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:40,230
is of course the village where to put

00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:42,450
all the data and this tall is running

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:47,340
for a while and because its creator for

00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:50,280
root 3 it's usually anything also after

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:57,090
it is finally prepare can take root on

00:13:50,280 --> 00:14:00,450
to manipulations in it and this rotary

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:05,310
is then the base for the next step I

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:08,040
will show if you want to create more

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:11,640
than one image tag not only a user image

00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,070
may be also a USB image then this step

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,380
it has to be done only once when you

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:26,360
have these basically you set up and

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:26,360
create more images of the world yeah

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:38,449
so this starts the first step creative

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:41,949
call PD create with a root path from the

00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:44,720
call before the type you want to have

00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:47,180
because you can of course configure more

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,019
than one time as i already told in the

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:53,720
description file this keppi Walesa image

00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:59,930
check only the destination directory

00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:02,570
where to put this is earnest and after

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:06,170
that it also takes a while you have

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:10,459
already image that you can use and you

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:14,329
can for example check it first with me n

00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:18,649
Mia or qme if you have learning English

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:23,690
for example and it yield you click on to

00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:29,209
get images ready it's actually as easy

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:33,199
as i described his here so so far we

00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:39,560
they are also only talking about the

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:46,250
sorcerer way as the because kiedy is so

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:55,240
far prepared only for opensuse but is as

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:58,550
i can show you here as I already said

00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,880
not only suppose you also go with only

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:04,699
smart so you can so far already build up

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:08,690
the filesystem tree with for example of

00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:11,600
a dollar on Damien I get this and

00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:15,050
because the design is quite independent

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,829
all the distributional specific stuff is

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:22,250
start in two special functions that are

00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:25,569
in the moment on prefixed by the name of

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:32,420
them is prefixed by soon sir officer sir

00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:36,850
so to help enhance TV for really to fit

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,850
all delhi and whatever images is

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,880
creating modules with the appropriate

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,940
prefix

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,360
to do mostly the pool or a configuration

00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,790
that is definitely different than soon

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,240
sir for example although you need help

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:57,090
enable the most mostly the boot stuff is

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,530
different in different distributions and

00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,170
of course the system content creation

00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:05,040
because it just is usually not available

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:08,880
or none of the solutions yeah and after

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:14,010
this steps are done I think it should be

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:18,920
easy to do these other distribution

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,920
images with it and

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,430
so I can only say this contribute if you

00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,410
are interested in reading system

00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:34,390
managers and you may be familiar with

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:38,830
other distributions if you are able to

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:41,800
program at home then you will be people

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:45,010
have it easy because TV is completely

00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:50,770
built in phone only some parts are most

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:53,800
chance fit and it is open source and

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:59,290
free software because its license GPL

00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:02,410
and the carnival you can simply check

00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:11,080
out it on the pit repository and value

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:15,790
of T so if you want to find out more

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:18,730
about CD there are two websites from

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:21,600
check the page on that is de and of

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,730
course in the open source really key

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,510
where you can find some more use cases

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:31,510
there are also already people that did

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:35,550
some projects minute they're mostly have

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:40,600
some descriptions where what made it and

00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:43,210
wrote it down in the key led a tiki to

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,360
find more examples and at quite good

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:51,780
documentation but I have the privilege

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:56,310
here it's a PVE cookbook where you can

00:18:51,780 --> 00:19:01,840
quite easily create some types of images

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:05,140
step-by-step explains and if you want to

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,320
install it yrp n you can find them in

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:12,880
the open source of good service in the

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:17,670
project visualization appliances you

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:21,640
know I think I was quite fast so i

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:25,660
already am finished with my talk so if

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:29,290
you have questions just ask them

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:33,160
so at the moment only opensuse is fully

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:35,050
supported yeah but is of course it is

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:39,870
designed platform independent of

00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:43,440
distribution independent so basically

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:47,050
you only in everything possible yeah

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,530
yeah yeah yeah if this is only the

00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:54,100
specific task I Marcos are not avail

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:56,680
with that a different between these

00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:00,790
different distributions I don't know how

00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:03,790
to set up a meta system for example so

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:07,950
if you are able to do that you can

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:11,610
implement it and it should be easy good

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:13,930
yeah I think my problem is that the

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,810
extrusions already have their own

00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:19,330
infrastructure setup for things like

00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:22,960
that in their game has its tools for

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:26,560
building niceties and installation cds

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,800
or dvds or other images we got the same

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,100
in furthermore so there's no we are need

00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:36,100
to adapt to from another distribution

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:39,760
which may be done filling up what you

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:43,210
have to put quite a lot of effort into

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,300
it to allow the it's all our

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,480
distributions so the question is does it

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,730
have will benefit who compares with the

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,000
truth other distributions already head

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,550
for quite a while even before TV has

00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,880
been stashed the only benefit I

00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:03,370
personally see is the music shop Souza

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,650
studio to build other distributions

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,860
because this is a unique project is

00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,390
others I don't know mr. Bhushan who

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:16,030
already has a similar in construction

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:20,170
it's really cool and and if you could

00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:23,140
manage to implement a bit system for

00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,900
other distributions out of studio this

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:29,030
would be

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:32,750
great effort for everyone so basically

00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:35,540
to do that it would be necessary to make

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,160
it possible to create because in the

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,050
pier service we already are able to

00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,510
build packages actually for other

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,750
distributions and says it is quite based

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:51,470
on a baby good service yeah but I've try

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:53,510
to go super busy it's not quite usable

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,170
as a tool to be used within our

00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:59,240
distribution cell so basically a deus ex

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:04,070
is going to come together and sit down

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:06,520
for whatever maybe we'll find a way to

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:11,750
improve this to make this happen I think

00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:14,420
the the main thing that differentiates

00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:16,940
TV from all the other distribution

00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,820
scripts that are there to build life

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,250
through Jesus that it is not

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,820
distribution specific so if you have a

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:28,940
tool that everybody can use of course it

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:31,520
would be adoption fairly what you have

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,810
to put quite a efforts into it to make

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,440
it happen that it

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:40,380
able to give our distributions hi mark

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,230
I'm not sure how hard it would be to

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,530
implement I mean what do you think it's

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,480
too odd because at least they already

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,960
mentioned they are scripts doing video

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,640
editors for example and I think you're

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,150
more or less doing the same so we could

00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:08,700
slip out some specific parts and plug it

00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:10,620
in a key so no yeah that one one

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,590
description and ever touch me but it for

00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,170
and you get it yeah but the problem is

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,120
in history because every teenager you

00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,940
already had them towards every nobody

00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:26,040
came together and I definitely like it

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:32,310
for to keep it from my design the same

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:34,680
examples but it's all I we need just

00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:37,320
about building distribution is just

00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:40,110
another customer who wants to go this

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,180
way for filling is applying any his own

00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,220
code to the distribution right now he

00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,560
runs all the different generations

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,570
ensues it he wants to trust package his

00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,480
application all the stuff for different

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,340
things like that but the big idea that

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,620
is also they want to have to one

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,390
description for all the setup and their

00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,130
Hardware private a lot of stuff involved

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,350
when these clients are some things like

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,910
that and if they don't want to like or

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,190
if it has some awesome we don't want to

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,230
like this box running suse linux or

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,360
whatever then the chest would place the

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,460
pot old take this distribution we made

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,960
that and let people never get panic at

00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,670
least it works with different versions

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,430
of Susan Aronson it would be really

00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:18,990
great if I now that more and more

00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,090
diligence Asian is coming maintains a

00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,730
rabbit of it if someone asks I have to

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,700
have this appliance for my speculation

00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:28,950
stuff running fedora tip Ian taste

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,050
whatever and then it would be much

00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,280
easier to package all the stuff I want

00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:35,470
to ship and so then

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,450
things like that and having a generic

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,250
tune which that's all of us would be

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,750
really nice and since its scripted I

00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,170
haven't looked i have looked a little

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,810
bit into it and invited to adjust this

00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:49,480
thing's just fix other watson should be

00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:53,230
doable so more question about the

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:59,530
framework is the studio part is it

00:24:53,230 --> 00:25:01,810
already open sauce now it is available

00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:10,240
but i think it's not really open sources

00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:12,160
too that's maybe I can ask in the build

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,890
services talk later because I'm not have

00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,590
more than the conservative Italy and in

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:19,810
the bills are admitted in in the studio

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:25,000
to talk later I not be involved in the

00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:28,960
studio team you're rich and our

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,630
perfusion can i use it for / net yeah

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,730
yeah definitely because it's basically

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,760
the same you only have to define the

00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:40,810
repository for the / packages and the

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:46,420
configuration is nearly the same they're

00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:48,750
just cheap opensuse novels yeah some

00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,750
people are

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:58,340
do you know of real or uses of PB for

00:25:53,750 --> 00:26:01,880
that people doing that on the bigger

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:07,930
keeping the Ricky there are some use

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:11,900
cases people actually using it yeah to

00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:16,460
resources to do for example ships and

00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:18,890
appliance system image to do in-house

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,710
that customers can do in-house image

00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:31,190
creation didn't so it is basically its

00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:33,080
own custom about the deep waves or week

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,390
when process is it already implemented

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:41,510
in TV right now because I'm over talking

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:44,620
park for a year or so back because it's

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:48,560
not allowed to rebuild azusa based

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:52,040
distribution and spread it if it still

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:56,960
contains the Susie's hands let your

00:26:52,040 --> 00:27:02,390
mother but then there is a simple I mean

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,520
that sir rights law stuff so there's a

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:07,610
simple way of just requesting

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:13,240
permissions to just a little stuff and

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:13,240
there's a tool called REM grandia which

00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:22,990
yeah yeah similar choice not to install

00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:27,830
these negatives that are private it's

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:31,520
related to King I guess you can split

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:33,800
that up then I have to to set up the

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,280
homepage service sauce from which should

00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,280
be in which

00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:43,110
you certainly don't have heels to it

00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:46,159
they're all the prelate packages are

00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:48,840
separate agata course but the

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:53,039
dependencies form other papers are I

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:56,820
don't think you can oh you can't fail

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,360
okay so there it's just mr. made package

00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,679
then instead dash branding their

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,370
upstream that contains the absolute

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:11,399
branding and a special consumer and neck

00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:13,049
/ all that is like some of these foods

00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:15,690
best brightening package that is

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:25,299
included here separately that's the

00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:27,590
reason why is there Phil

00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:33,440
for the pictures

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:37,520
this will have Quattro so yeah event

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:41,870
adapter it can create light in case and

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:46,880
exit your design thoughts of 48 create

00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:50,210
an installer yeah it I did not describe

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:55,340
that you can also create the or actually

00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:59,090
the and then got three images that will

00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:02,330
be released in three months or something

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,100
like that will be created with keely so

00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:09,260
installation sources are also possible

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:14,090
anymore actually okay its own lease less

00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:18,890
11 sp1 where this ecology okay doesn't

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:23,809
matter it works and it's actually the

00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:25,940
part i working on uShip this

00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:28,789
configuration process example I don't

00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:33,740
think yeah yeah let I interpret in user

00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:40,130
share of Pegasus key they are so fingers

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:44,929
in this communal but even 11 touch 12 no

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:48,200

some images or also like USB stick and a

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,850
lot of configuration is there an

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,260
insulation in the Chester yeah not for

00:29:52,850 --> 00:30:01,730
