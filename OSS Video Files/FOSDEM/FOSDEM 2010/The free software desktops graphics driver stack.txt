Title: The free software desktops graphics driver stack
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2010
Description: 
	By Luc Verhaegen



4 years after the modular X tree was released, we can clearly see that we did not fully satisfy all expectations and that we are really holding the free software desktop back.

In this talk, the current situation gets analysed, and the next step, providing more integrated graphics driver stacks, a change that will make life easier for all involved, is introduced and demonstrated.


FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
for years since we release the stable

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,140
modular version of the exhort server and

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,090
it's time we start reviewing or maybe

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,099
it's the time the rights right to review

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,269
a bit what has happened and what hasn't

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,460
happened three sorting there is this

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,660
feeling it's lingering it's been tough

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,359
for quite a while that there still

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,039
something missing in this whole thing

00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,840
something quite fundamental and well

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,789
lots of things have been moving in

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,130
exhorted by moving way too fast from

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,619
time to time there's things like lip pci

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,030
access which were years too early known

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,079
tested that just went in straight away

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,969
this is a lot of movement maybe some of

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,059
it was partly good but some of it was

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,489
also party very bad so we are feeling

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,280
that we're not really delivering what we

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,789
should be delivering yet but quite a way

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,379
away and in recent years there the

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,289
reason here so there have been some

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,690
changes in how the observer commits

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,289
there are being handled at the moment

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,760
there is some but some way of reviewing

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,460
patches at least this has never happened

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,040
before so there are some ways we're

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,369
trying to improve apparently and we are

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,799
mainly looking at our process to see how

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,280
we should manage the export project and

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,729
maybe this is not really the best idea

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:26,400
we want to take over a few things but we

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:29,430
do want to have a more field process for

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,820
something as the accelerate 3d I stand I

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,799
stand before jumping up and this is most

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,659
of your talk about graphics driver stack

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,460
and that means all the business first

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:45,060
all over your system so yeah you will

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,280
dive in now what was Maya and four years

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,640
later we can actually review what was

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,740
good and what was bad so what was good

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,750
about modular and if many people think

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,540
that module is the first time that we

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,420
were able to build

00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,910
except 86 as I ended up being a first

00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,510
time we were able to build a ex drivers

00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:08,780
outside of the tree this was not true XP

00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:11,060
86 for two though the whole build-up to

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,300
treat online and corridor that took a

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,090
few years in the late 90s already gave

00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,300
us the ability to build drivers outside

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,840
of the tree and quite easily so there

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,820
was an SDK are already available the 36

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,220
developers were very forward-looking in

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,620
this respect between though they didn't

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,590
really they try to design very well for

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,090
the hardware from that time though there

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,740
were things that were coming up like

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,280
multi-head that only happened slightly

00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,900
later and now there's it completely the

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,240
hardware is so different from 10 years

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,770
ago at the moment this day could not

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,750
foresee at the time and this was an

00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,540
issue in the early 2000s where people

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,150
that project was like who doesn't he was

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,400
maybe not moving fast enough but it

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,860
wasn't all that that was made up here at

00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,380
the time an issue with the when I

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,959
started developing drivers in 2003 issue

00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,730
then was that an almost no distributions

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,190
came with this fantastic SD canes

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,100
installed already the only one that I

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:13,519
remember from the timeless arch linux

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,459
live better rosencrantz ER at the time

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,200
nobody probably even remembers this it's

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,239
been seven years ago that was the only

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,670
distribution that actually installed the

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,650
SDK even though it was perfectly

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,110
available so he was actually made out

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,790
for because people were not really aware

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,880
of this it was made a bit harder to

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,769
actually install an X traffic server it

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,910
was actually a very easy process if you

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:41,209
have the SDK so when Manuel the major

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:43,489
change from a driver for point of view

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,220
is that this SD came suddenly was

00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,630
installed everywhere it was a package

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,550
that was available everywhere

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,850
this was fantastic for driver

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:55,820
development auto tools is another big

00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,110
thing as a driver developer you're doing

00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,760
your thing you don't want to care about

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,450
a build system you want something that

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,490
everybody knows there are people here

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,440
you can talk ages about how bad lip to

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,660
la by all bad autocom how about

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,010
everything is I don't want to care I

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,920
wanted the developer graphics driver I

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,320
don't want to spend too much time with

00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,910
the build system for it auto contestar

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,720
auto tools is something that everybody

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,930
knows it's as its issues fine but there

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,550
is no real alternative but not unless

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,610
you want to change every two years from

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:32,000
guild system that's also not fun another

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,390
big changes we had the whole tree split

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,580
up and here it says clear structure well

00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:40,460
the next I will say something else it's

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,530
a clear structure of many parts and are

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,480
very easily accessible and very easy to

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,260
build separately now this is this is a

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,570
good change so there are many bad things

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:54,380
as well that came from this then not all

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:57,260
of them had to do with monitor XP 86 was

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,470
very very stable insanely stable they

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:03,560
even try to maintain a be is to invite

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,840
those companies at the time this wasn't

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,580
thinking invite those companies I want

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,830
to do flow source drivers to please

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,690
please do a close source whatever you

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,760
have to remember this is more than 10

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,640
years ago this is a completely different

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,980
situation nobody was really offering X

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,970
any support much from a hardware side

00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:25,910
not Deb nice us today so they even tried

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,830
a kept to keep the a bi-stable these

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:31,730
days it's actually your problem to keep

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,110
the API stable it's it's went then

00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,470
there's nothing to do with mother it's a

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:39,100
developer mindset so we went from one

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:43,040
opposite to the absolute outer offices

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:45,930
this is not helping us at all one big

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,460
promise in 2004 when people

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,490
were doing the work on turning the

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:54,960
Xfinity 63 into a modeler Tory early

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,430
export monolithic 3 there was also a lot

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,650
of work of course turning all of this in

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,539
auto tools this does not and splitting

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,259
up things where I wasn't staring this

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:06,840
was a lot of work and kudos to Danielle

00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,990
and whoever else worked on it then

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,449
because it was a lot of work nicely done

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,310
but it there but there were lots of

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,870
changes that are not complete yet like

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,970
the proto change does that happen by

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,770
theatre utter or a year ago there was a

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,630
lot of pain we had to go through that if

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,669
we had seen this four or five years ago

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,310
it would have saved us a lot of trouble

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,590
now this we couldn't foresee den leader

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,509
we were just too busy or too caught up

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,820
in other things but one of the big

00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,770
promises then is that vendors were

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,620
always patching their trees to get new

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:40,530
features in today the features are not

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,180
the problem we have usually enough

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,099
features as a vendor you have enough

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,889
features in your observer it's not

00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:49,500
stable enough as a vendor distribution

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,270
vendor you're really not shipping the

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,620
bear observer this is not something

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,949
that's happening they're still panting

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,990
their trees but from the opposite side

00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:00,690
just like with the stability highly

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,520
stable highly unstable we went from

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,710
patching because there were no features

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,990
it wasn't doing what people want no well

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:10,020
still not doing what the distribution

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,419
gun is want but their features or not

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,300
it's just not that production ready

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,889
again this is getting better when you

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,740
recent releases with the point releases

00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:23,340
this that's a good system reviews cooks

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,830
it's gonna go on yeah so I think part of

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,470
the problem was with the huge monolithic

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,680
releases if you put out now see it would

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,390
go crap or at least candidate I really

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,220
need to make

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,770
this is me because I'm gonna have to

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,320
ship the result we put out the release

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,970
candidate now known yes yeah we call

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,580
station we'll fix it up in a point

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,850
release which hopefully we do so as long

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,520
as you never 4.0 in the stable

00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,710
product then you should before we're

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,000
right I used to work not anymore at the

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,560
moment we never shipped them we always

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,390
ship the later for the latest version we

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,190
had trouble enough with the matter where

00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,170
you have that the best place at the time

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,390
get trouble not being offensive us and

00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,190
developing a drive and exited this was

00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,430
just in the same task for the people

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,140
here now nobody built six anymore I mean

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,950
this is a nice little survey i want to

00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:20,720
have you who here has built its sins at

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:22,550
winmalee put up your hands oh that's

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,490
actually pretty bad but it's not too bad

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,920
is what twenty-five percent it's like a

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:32,110
lipstick by twenty-five percent who here

00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:35,660
has build an ex modular in the last year

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,729
more than I expected actually I should

00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,650
have done this in the first one can do

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:41,660
this one city one I'm not doing the X

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,180
from scratch and just getting Julia

00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,790
crystals excellent Vivian tipped out

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,070
there in the lower trees and running

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,860
deep aage build package on them and then

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,450
using that this is a beautiful solution

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,180
for somebody like me who just wants to

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,700
draw by drivers and I cannot claim that

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:03,680
I've built modular for the last two meet

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:05,960
two yeah 3 years and weidler no no no so

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,060
the question then becomes yet you're bad

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,810
products why why do not you so many of

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,810
you building this

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:23,720
yeah so who's still just anything today

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:26,180
yeah there are a few yeah okay who is

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,910
using Owens losing the build script from

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:34,910
the modular who is using that build

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:36,530
script was using the build script and

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,060
now without answer your question in with

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,980
who's using that build script in the

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,950
treating modular it was using that build

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:47,270
script in the last year nobody I did you

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:49,100
Daniel universe yeah okay hey anchored

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,080
also wrote is on there are quite a few

00:09:49,100 --> 00:10:00,110
people were roped everyone it that's how

00:09:51,080 --> 00:10:02,060
it is Phil doesn't work to the music if

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,660
you're a debian user check out julie

00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,010
anne san luis is too busy with his PhD

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,100
checkout sheet of the end of the work is

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,800
work there it's beautiful it's i found

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,930
this and I was the happiest six months

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,580
ago I'd towards finally managed to find

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:20,180
the time to pour my Unicron driver to

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:22,100
107 I was so happy when I thought it so

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,470
we'll need test anything today and I'm

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:28,700
not a big one it's only X that became

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:31,970
our Lord Mirza lip tiara or the drm is a

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,130
three at the time no way so the graphics

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,490
driver problem graphics hardware is the

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:40,730
most complex thing out there you have a

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:43,130
200-watt card to teraflops six days

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:47,630
place whatever its there's nothing like

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:49,670
it 200 watt CPU is 125 or something

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,940
there's nothing like it it is really

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:55,130
unbelievable complex it's unbelievably

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,310
complex it's very diverse through your

00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,500
graphics makers that are still alive

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,180
they are completely different there is

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,830
nothing the same that you can find

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,170
there's a few lines in there but that's

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,000
it there is a feature are going on there

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,560
just be war going on between the vendors

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,330
except for until they display their own

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,130
game anyway with two others they're

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,400
constantly

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,290
featured on speak and to others also all

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,630
of them actually six months to a year

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,970
and you have new hardware you have no

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,740
supported you have to bring in now as I

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,860
explained yesterday with my classroom

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:29,140
talk the software that is close to the

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,450
hardware mimics the hardware it's always

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,240
going to be very much the same in a lot

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,670
of its properties it's going to be very

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,620
similar it's very complex it's going to

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,780
be constantly moving its new features

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,970
all the time new devices all the time

00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,160
it's always gonna be buggy and it's

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,200
never gonna be stable we know that this

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,620
is true for all software always bugging

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,290
every stable but for graphics drivers if

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,150
the few orders of magnitude more if you

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,130
look at the different pieces that are

00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,410
there for graphics drivers on let's take

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,540
it fictitious of the example here some

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,360
something almost the same as a radeon

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,090
you have microcode you have the event

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,720
driver you have lived theorem you have

00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:13,330
its or driver you have the right driver

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,130
you have gallium driver and if it were

00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,840
just it already you can even have media

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,520
acceleration that are secretive seven

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,700
different pieces scattered all over your

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,650
system that's the complexity of the

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,420
driver and it's very unstable and it

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,700
stabilizes the rest of your sister pole

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,850
so graphics drivers is a difficult

00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,280
problem I wanted to do a survey week ago

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,200
but I kind of this isn't that remote

00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,630
practical at all survey we had was

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,830
already difficult enough so well where I

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,290
would have talked to michael here from

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,750
products escaping this we will probably

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:47,740
do the story with a lot of funny funny

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:49,300
questions like if you're Catholic and a

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,800
lot of funny questions and we will work

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,660
out a nice surveying we'll see what

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,640
people respond but the answers I will

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,650
see from the servant is that people will

00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,290
say that most of the bugs they

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,450
experience in the graphics range eighty

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,580
to ninety percent is the can be blamed

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,710
on the graphics driver it's mostly the

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,990
graphing survivor infrastructure is very

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,209
very uncommon

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,770
happens of court all the time but

00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:14,399
compared to the graphic services bugs

00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:16,350
very very common and everybody who is

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,990
using a graphics driver wants to be able

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,690
to just grab the latest drafting driver

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:24,720
pieces and build them install them from

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,149
them everybody wants this very very easy

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,270
and today you only have this for the H

00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:32,940
driver only the X Iver because the XP is

00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:36,589
six people did so much work and we now

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:39,690
have used the SDK installed everywhere

00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:43,410
so from a graphics for you we can

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,820
identify the board different yeah the

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,339
stakeholders in this whole thing we have

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,810
the hardware vendor and the hardware

00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,120
vendors they want to sell you new

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,339
hardware yet Nexus release so if you are

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,080
using their hardware now they want you

00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,740
to be happy with their hardware they

00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:01,770
want you to be happy with their support

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:04,320
also they want you to be able to use new

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,910
hardware with your existing software if

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,230
you want to merge to something else you

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,180
move to something else won't get new

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,190
hardware when I go faster you want to

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,260
remain in your familiar environments

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,120
especially in the enterprise you want to

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,730
keep it mostly r software that you trust

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,220
you want to keep it and you want to make

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,200
you Julie want to run it faster so you

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,959
want to upgrade the hardware so hardware

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,640
vendors they also want you to be able to

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,070
replace your drivers all the time and

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,410
teach yoga and software distributors I

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,959
work for the distributor for a bit too

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:36,000
short little oh and they're mostly the

00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,410
packaging in the support and if they're

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,750
a commercial distributor linux

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,970
distributor or whatever they are pit you

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,399
they're being paid for packaging and

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,740
offering you support they want to be

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:51,660
able to take in new hardware support as

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:55,230
well without having to change their one

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,459
QA cycles operating system anything in

00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,860
there they want to change as little as

00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:01,500
possible and just install it you rack up

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,940
side the whole stack they don't want to

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,760
bother with anything else because that

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,610
is a big big stability issue that they

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,680
will pay dearly for if something goes

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,430
wrong they will baby

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,250
and it's gonna cost them a lot of money

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:18,110
users there are many sorts uses you can

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,240
identify here there's a normal your home

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,580
user there's the enterprise user and

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,890
there is the advanced users like the

00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:30,800
average faronics visitor or everybody in

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,690
here you're the advanced users there is

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,120
no difference for our graphics driver

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,950
point of view between the three what

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,750
benefits the enterprise and as always a

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,000
nasty word enterprise is always scary

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,940
but benefits the enterprise benefits

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,010
everybody else as well and then the last

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,620
one the developers what the developers

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,089
want as I said before auto tools I don't

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,580
want to care about anything else but my

00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,950
driver this is the first thing if there

00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,660
is a bug in there I'll go and fix it but

00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,630
I don't want to do this I want to just

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,339
work my driver posted all the time if I

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,589
have to go and fix it not fun I want to

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,980
do the driver but you also want to do is

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,630
shipped my driver the latest version

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,899
ship it to everybody and get feedbacks

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:15,170
get matches in get it updated easily and

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:18,110
quickly so what everybody wants here is

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,000
being able o first the first the first

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,640
what does everybody wants but especially

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,290
since inclusive things i'm doing the

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:29,720
color routine adrenaline so linux is not

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,070
ready for the desktop at this point we

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,560
can't say that we are ready for the

00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,320
desktop at all we're still several years

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,240
away from that and most many people in

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,589
here are thinking well many of the

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,330
graphics driver developed they're all

00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,760
thinking all gaming gimme gimme gimme

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,080
we're years and years and years away

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,100
from gaming if we're not even on the

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:52,160
desktop yet so we performance is not

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,570
that important features they're nice

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,940
they're marketing performance and

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,560
features there for all the stakeholders

00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,579
organize their marketing advances for

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,440
the hardware vendors and for the

00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:03,829
distributors but what everybody really

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,929
wants is stability and the basic

00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:08,630
functionality this is what everybody

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:12,370
needs if you don't provide this you get

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:15,370
very unhappy users and sadly

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,630
as Mike Michael site is like this there

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,089
are a lot of people in there get their

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:22,390
beauty driver doesn't work they will

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:24,010
give your endless crap but they don't

00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,540
realize that basic functionality is

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,730
already there and this is already a lot

00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,470
the crazy functionality works great but

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,750
we're going to usually only hear the

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,760
very noisy people who have a small bug

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,080
in their TV driver while there are so

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,990
many other things that should be worked

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,740
on the phone now all these three above

00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:43,300
they all want the same thing basically

00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,980
except for the developers at this point

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,920
there are only a few developers with a

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,160
stability and basic functionality above

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:55,900
features and above performance and this

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:58,360
is not that great so if it wants a rich

00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:02,530
ass very hard slide to render for

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:05,020
openoffice on this mule for 17 here is a

00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,210
slightly justify graphics driver stack

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,809
here's the exhort server and separate

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:14,650
fee XYZ I wanted to do a 660 or feed

00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:16,600
others oh but I thought against this and

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,820
it separates being held separately

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,309
unlike the other parts here and this is

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:24,280
some very simplified dependencies you

00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:26,410
have here you have miss of the Orion

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,150
just showing you the arriver yet sending

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,190
for gallium at the top it's also

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,980
mentioned by missing media support but I

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,840
was just flutter of the police even more

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,230
live the RM and Driver specifically

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,870
Dearen single system this was recently

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:43,780
well recently it was admitted that it

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:46,840
was moved that this used to be one part

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,610
a year and half or so ago it was moved

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,309
this part was moving the colonel and

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:55,030
three months or so ago Kristin Augsburg

00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:57,130
finally adjusted the mesa de ren through

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:01,250
you can actually reflect this which

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:05,100
didn't need to be a deep

00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:07,890
hello well if you look at the different

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,430
api's here this driver there about 50 of

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:14,640
them so this arrow here is actually a

00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,440
very very stable API there 50 drivers if

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,300
you want to change something you have to

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,800
depending on the features you have to

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,620
change a lot of drivers so inherently

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,660
this is very very stable same year there

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,600
about 15 the right drivers this is quite

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,580
stable gallium there about 10 or so this

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,320
is this yeah you can see that interface

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,510
of changing all that interface because

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,780
it's handled badly later later later

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:40,290
later that all comes here people are

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,150
trying to this is also relatively stable

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,810
and you have to know that this line here

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:48,710
the xorg sir depends on lip theorem 2 30

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:52,070
which is from august two thousand six

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:55,470
that's what the xserver depends on here

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:59,730
the nice thing about here is because of

00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:01,830
this thing mesa dr I is depending on

00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:06,590
almost very latest version of the big

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:10,170
theorem and this is a very unstable mess

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,810
yeah the other things is also relatively

00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,670
stable depending on with features of EMS

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,710
and memory management is still moving a

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,390
lot but that will also become better if

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,730
you look at this more closely and look

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,050
at the different graphics part the point

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,330
of the things i pointed out already

00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,070
they're very stable that there are a few

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,140
parts which are very very unstable

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,200
because they're very little depending on

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,110
this piece they can be as unstable as

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:39,530
the driver developers once this part is

00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:39,530
well this is also very very unstable

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,210
this is the idea and I was brought out a

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:52,770
few weeks ago or a few months ago at XTS

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:54,540
move the drivers back into the x-ray or

00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:58,590
the one good thing about this whole

00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:02,250
stack they want to do not a very very

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:04,440
good idea why because it has no real

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,600
advantage that at work system or a build

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,340
test system that already offers it

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,290
doesn't offer you anything more as long

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,850
as you don't list hardware so i miss you

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,760
don't diss peaches you're not getting

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:17,430
anything what it will give us is if

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,080
people in the X in this block the right

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,700
light with me as a theorem give them the

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,140
right to get change the API even more

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,060
this is the last thing we need it won't

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,240
we need to clean it up but we need to

00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,620
clean it up in a way I mean if this can

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,900
only happen so we need to clean it up

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,670
and sucks your weight that we are not

00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,860
hurting everybody too much lip these

00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,020
tixs don't even try to do that again

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,810
because next time I would also be more

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,550
business I once got blamed by a bird a

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:48,300
few years ago when the PCI access

00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,920
happens that it was my fault I had

00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,130
nothing to do with leticia axis itself

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,740
but I cleaned up the ati driver this big

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:59,690
ati driver would prob'ly everything and

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:03,570
then ran either Mac 64 actually two or

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:06,570
the rage and radeon if I hadn't cleaned

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:10,170
that up then this moves to PCI axis Bass

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:14,520
Pro have been a lot harder so yeah I'm

00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:16,170
still participating psychiatrist anyway

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:20,370
just what will happen here is that the

00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:23,250
current x86 API will get out loud and I

00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:25,740
would not end it that unreasonable when

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,020
somebody says hey it's been six years

00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,120
why not change all the symbols in there

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,250
seems you except in six and front and

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,390
changes to absorb we can do this now

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:38,870
great idea so it did the bogus ideas we

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,870
don't want this

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:47,490
so well now I get to mine oh yeah

00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:49,380
Michael animation so what we divided

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,590
away celery when one from far this month

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,179
one we want to tie these parts most from

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,370
their rest of the tree we want to type

00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:00,510
II slow so I disclose maternal try to

00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:05,639
tie that Lowe's until here and look what

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:08,070
will happen then it'll work yay hey

00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:09,779
worked and this lines thing that they

00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,760
disappeared and came back if I have time

00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:15,899
for one second at the end I'll show you

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:19,260
the slide water if it's possible we want

00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:23,610
to get there what do you see here yeah

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:25,830
this is completely driver internal it

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,840
just depended upon by these two by

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,269
gallium and maybe the media exploration

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,769
it's completely dry or internal and this

00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:33,360
is the theta it's really deep

00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:38,460
stabilizing the whole system at the

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:42,659
moment because that way is absolutely

00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,039
not to hear anything we every week every

00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:46,350
two weeks meet on your version every

00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:49,230
time I exabytes we make we make

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,149
improvements proposal do quite releases

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:55,169
and improve API to improve performs in

00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:57,929
turquoise but while new suffered peg on

00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:59,669
new stuff old software continues running

00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:02,549
it continues running because it only

00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:04,649
depends on this part of the drm my duty

00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:07,769
driver my 3d driver depend on my trip

00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:10,260
said it would be all right look I don't

00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:12,269
believe it as I seal it this I see that

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,769
this block here being bumped every few

00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:16,799
weeks because there was only driving

00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:21,269
changes this blog has gone debbie tube

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:23,070
and dri depends fully on the latest no

00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:25,649
notes for inhale it's cool persons back

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:28,500
before radeon is the latest convergence

00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:30,840
bag is a month a monthly or the whole

00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,360
mess up three between GL on top this is

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,720
insane so this is where you want to go

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,090
and suddenly inside the striker stack

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:42,140
I've done this one

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:44,240
neutral so much you can clean up there's

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,240
these hitters here this header here is

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,799
installed with lipsy at the moment a

00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,169
graphics driver hitter is installed will

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,020
exceed the driven development action or

00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:55,820
Devlin for lip theorem is installing

00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:09,440
actually ahead of two hitters for our

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:11,960
350 I would register information so yeah

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,270
if you move to this then it's up to the

00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,850
driver development to decide how stable

00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:22,880
offices in this part this will be

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:27,080
inherently stable anyway so next one out

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:33,350
to battle the steam ahead well over half

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:39,260
an hour okay or we can have you pick are

00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:43,460
you so what and the rest of your system

00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:45,860
depends on anything else one more there

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,770
this is where all the dependencies are

00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:53,980
the rest of your system rounding with

00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:56,390
lipids 11 and may such your GL sorry

00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,100
they're all over there there is nothing

00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,870
that directly depends on these parts

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,710
here it's only the graphics drives

00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:05,010
itself that's fully that being map being

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,200
wrapped waiting for

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,940
nice to at the moment because with all

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,880
the fancy ideas and moving graphics

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,590
drivers is perceived and even further

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,050
there's no no idea where this is going

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:20,010
in but I'm sorry what's the difference

00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:26,220
to what we have today and if you could

00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:29,850
not follow the slides ostomy because

00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:32,010
that looks exactly like teenage this is

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,890
one source car ball over here you

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,330
couldn't do that if it's possible oh you

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,580
want to be high jumper you saying that I

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,350
une did not you want to finish in it oh

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,120
well look at the slides will be

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:48,870
available anywhere for you guys if

00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:50,760
you're understanding it so when you the

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:59,340
next one is the knick game that you've

00:26:50,760 --> 00:27:00,870
tied easels yeah no no any of the pity

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,090
to the package manager even wants to

00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,310
split this up you want to have one if

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,930
it's possible at all if these things are

00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,090
moving too much it's up to the driver

00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,910
developer it's up to the people who are

00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,500
developing these drivers they if they

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,630
move it out there free to do in this

00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,940
this area with if they want it's their

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,560
jobs if users are not happy with it then

00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,120
they blame this they don't blame

00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,730
anything else they blame the driver

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,320
developers here and if packages want

00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,720
they can have packages all separately

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,730
and have their dependencies year all

00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,010
separate this is all should all be

00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,800
possible when you just update one of the

00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:37,770
pieces and just the they may be a very

00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,600
very tight dependency here which is okay

00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,550
this is very this movie Bob there may be

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,500
a very very dependency that doesn't have

00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,500
to be it's up to the driver developers

00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,580
so yeah here nothing depends on this

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,679
directly it's all the dependencies are

00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,320
on this side of the tree if you make

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,710
these more movable if you care about

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,190
compatibility in these AP is a you

00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:09,720
don't have to care much a bit then the

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:12,420
whole world becomes a lot and it is okay

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,490
when you media features when you build

00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,650
this against the older xserver on older

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,540
Mesa or overly there and all the drm if

00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,230
you need new features when you say hey

00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:24,120
this new feature sorry we can offer you

00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,380
that but we can offer you the basic

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,640
stuff it cannot give you the basic

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,919
functionality and this is what people

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,710
want if you say it's half the speed than

00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,480
it used to be well people can also also

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,160
switch the shadow with be if it's really

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,799
now fast enough in the world through and

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,750
hardware but this is all ok people want

00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,940
to have a basic functionality first and

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,460
the rest can come when the new stuff is

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,410
making it into the distributions this

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,720
can come then at the moment if you want

00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,340
to keep it if you want to keep old I

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,580
wrote software and we can just update

00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:58,200
the driver to fix the bugs you have

00:28:52,580 --> 00:29:00,090
because you will have bugs always so

00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,070
what am i doing in unicomm because I'd

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,700
I'm not just talking to talk here I

00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:08,820
actually do stuff I have taken my unico

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,799
and I've done which a very yeah I don't

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,750
radeon HD in-betweens from the last few

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,809
years and up that much happened to unico

00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,520
and nessa da right card also didn't move

00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:19,740
that much in the channel drm well it

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,390
moved a bit but there was mostly driven

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,320
by the Taiwanese guys and it's not

00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:27,750
really working out so it's there's some

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,690
versions here that's a sort 120 version

00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:35,040
or the seventh of 0 X or release and one

00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:38,970
at seven yeah we got lazy here but you

00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:41,970
have to c 2010 is about here 2006's

00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:44,190
about here but to make it even more

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,690
visible at Glendon some distributions

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,809
this is where they be an old stable

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:51,929
lives that's a living x that debian

00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:54,850
stable Lenny there is debian squeeze

00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:57,010
with Julianne Cristo packages from

00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:59,560
months ago that's what I was using at

00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:01,450
the time and here the opensuse level of

00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:05,110
one still running on this laptop i will

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,790
use as a workstation what I'm doing with

00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:09,340
my unit oh man I've been doing this for

00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:11,230
years because i am the term olympic 386

00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,300
versus absorb the urine ground right

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,280
outside of it at all and just kept on

00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,470
developing drivers I used to be

00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,870
compatible until six months ago and fill

00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:23,320
all the way through four dot 3 into the

00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:25,270
food out 3a 2003 release of Excel oh

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,400
this is how far back mon Unicron driver

00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,400
used to build and give you a valid mode

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:33,190
with acceleration i trow this out

00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,170
outlining built there is nothing abunda

00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:38,170
LTS the oldest of all healthy necessary

00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:40,180
yet slightly above one lot 0 so this I

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,190
still can't test of silent install so

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,320
everything else is relative this has

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,880
been a really really easy way but of

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,900
course I missed out a lot of pitches

00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:53,560
you're doing regular see what I'm doing

00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:56,740
for them is a dear I this is how far

00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,570
compatible i am there and this 3 this

00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,030
get tree is up there it's my unichrome

00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:04,810
repository there's unified branch in

00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:06,910
there this is where he builds now and it

00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:08,650
runs just as rapidly there as it runs on

00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:13,750
this side as it runs on the other side

00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:17,200
it's perfect linux kernel easy just

00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:21,640
building boom of course I'm next one guy

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:25,870
I did this week or so intel has 12

00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:29,530
people working more and we're pushing

00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:31,870
features at a faster rate than you as I

00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:34,480
said features of you features they're

00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:36,010
not stable because you can disable and

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,300
say hey we're not having a speech it did

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,550
so use it it really wants to speak to

00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,920
Google voters they will update arrest

00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,510
but don't force this on any right where

00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,010
we decided that we weren't going to do

00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:48,640
this anymore I mean we used to have

00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:51,490
support viendo your mother six to 11 or

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,450
12 this is all on the roof that'll this

00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,620
is one auto

00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,720
this is one minute I will prove the

00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,200
south great so at the point we remove

00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,040
all that compatibility we deleted a

00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,590
significant fraction of our bikes

00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,240
because it was all interactions with

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,830
different versions of interfaces if

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,350
thats everywhere and nobody was testing

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,150
a little service because we're not even

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:14,740
allowing yes but uh well that's how are

00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:16,590
you well I don't like it may men major

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,120
developers tell an enterprise

00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,710
distribution three months before they're

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,480
about to release their Enterprise

00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:26,460
version that their whole business model

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:30,640
is wrong this is not what should happen

00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:33,930
and wasn't it wasn't you everybody in

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,850
those who sow unified buildings driver

00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:38,110
ever since we have ele SE que des is how

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,280
it works you have all results we all

00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:46,810
notice all done this at least twenty

00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:49,300
five percent of the linux drm for my

00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:51,460
driver if you have k build installs if

00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,340
you have the headers in salt for your

00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,110
linux version you just wanna make when

00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:59,200
you have run configure your own makes

00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:02,950
you're done you have the drm you can

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,980
just install it gabriel headers they're

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:07,840
just debian tax very easy you can also

00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:12,550
do this film souza but i think i need a

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,890
slightly more work at hey so mesa dr is

00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:17,920
really ugly one you have two especially

00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:21,550
prepare your mesa to surround sound

00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:24,970
figure then send down into this

00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:29,380
directory and run may leak me about a

00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:32,950
and then you just point my driver treat

00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:36,760
this makes a directory I built

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:38,919
not that hard of course getting over the

00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:44,649
interface changes that could be nice to

00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:47,260
that week that was that was people so

00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:49,090
where do we go from here more people so

00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,320
start doing unified tree so the more

00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,360
people will start breaking out these

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,950
hard connections that are there now the

00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,200
more that people will start it care

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:59,230
about api's this will happen naturally

00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,409
and the api's will evolve better and in

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:06,880
a way that is easier to track tracking

00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:09,040
API changes is very painful in all these

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,010
parts it looks very painful and they

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,820
really painful one is measured ERI even

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:17,200
for a driver that hasn't moved that much

00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,300
that was a really big because nobody

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,879
cares and I think also these changes

00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,530
could have been avoided for the changes

00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:26,020
I've seen my remember if you want a

00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:29,379
plug-in feature that's it as I said you

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:31,450
can disable featured find many users

00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:32,829
will be happy until their next big

00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,859
distribution or where they will be

00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:37,569
happiest able to solo speed and at the

00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:39,609
same time you already get everything

00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:43,839
else tested you get feedback on

00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:45,520
everything else so Colonel drm it's not

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,750
that hard it's repository changes we've

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,119
just been through a big change already

00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,520
but the longer term as a driver

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,560
developer ass some of the guys one of

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,349
the guys who actually saw some lines

00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,660
invoke said in the last few years I do

00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:00,940
not like how everything is just meshed

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,650
together or mashed together in the urine

00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,200
driver it's all just throwing one piece

00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:07,030
changes pull this out and some things

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,030
will start making a lot more sense for

00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:13,450
tracking features and drug dependency

00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:15,339
it's if you change that it just looks a

00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:19,780
bit more messy but the interfaces can be

00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:23,079
tracked so much better lift erm this

00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:25,570
driver specific part move this house go

00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:28,430
for our own version for your own

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,710
private internal yeah it's almost a

00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:33,650
convenience library move to your own

00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:36,680
versioning and suddenly the link to Mesa

00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:38,390
will become a lot more sane it will be

00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,030
very easy to have that same thing again

00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:44,990
oh this is a nice one as well check out

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,970
you Azhar includes drm and find out

00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:51,590
through your package manager either RPM

00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:54,560
minus Q F or dpkg minus big s capital S

00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:56,690
on the files there and find out which

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,430
packages all the files in there belong

00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,920
to and also notice the to register

00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:03,080
definition files in there it's not how

00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,970
it should be not for driver specifically

00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,530
same thing about mode setting memory

00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:09,260
management than that with here and

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:11,870
standard Aaron like committing it up

00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,880
simply submitting c'mon Gophers those

00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,680
things are actually they can be fairly

00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,840
modular they can you pull the card they

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,210
can have nice separate interfaces split

00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,820
there and your life will become slightly

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:27,110
easier the life of the driver developer

00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:30,020
is already hardening meza methods at the

00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:35,450
moment is about 120 megabytes of source

00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:37,820
and even he releases that are happening

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:40,100
every time there is a major release

00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,200
amazed our minor Lisa Meza they are

00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:45,740
already shipping this in three different

00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,480
tar balls so there is already a clear

00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,940
line there the three different tar balls

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,880
maybe it's time to start modularizing

00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,500
some of this the interfaces are doable

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,940
and it's actually when you look into the

00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:01,430
whole build system there you see a nice

00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,960
little convenient nice little nice

00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:06,050
convenience libraries all the way

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,790
already and you can split there and try

00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,100
to formalize the api's for these

00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:12,470
libraries if you make these libraries if

00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,420
you make them shared objects you will

00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:17,240
probably lose one or two percent or

00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,440
whatever speed because of the lookups

00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,560
because that's the only reason that I've

00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,600
been hearing so far dad stuck the only

00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,950
reason why this tibia this is something

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:31,670
maybe you should also do check USR slash

00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:35,190
lip / DRI check the size of any of the

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:39,960
dr drivers in there you will be looking

00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:41,670
64 system at two points 6 megabytes 2.6

00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,210
megabytes and even the most feature-rich

00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:46,500
driver for a DRI at intel driver the

00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,890
source code is worth one point three

00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,869
megabytes so she comparison source about

00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,089
1.3 mega bytes and the end up with a

00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,890
binary a straight binary that is so

00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:57,540
wonderful I mean I was but what the Red

00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,099
Hat guys did their heads they said look

00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,260
I have this look Mase a lot eh I'll just

00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,540
fake it that makes about as hell yeah by

00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,730
know a guy guarantees because it's all

00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,680
part of the same package right the dot s

00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,940
0 and things depends on the right guys

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,280
are going together yeah yeah there's

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,500
fall asleep its reveal its that is in

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,660
advance as you go sighs win while not

00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,579
requiring that you provide stable api's

00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,210
for me but if you move the drivers out

00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:22,589
you become more stable on the matter

00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,569
it's always a portion pull it all the

00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:26,369
way to be poison poop no it's always be

00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:28,020
good we'll be pushing full but if the

00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:30,000
drivers are out there there's another

00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,950
hurdle then you have to jump over before

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,099
you make a change and you spend a bit

00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:36,690
more time thinking about the change and

00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:38,670
often in the circuit case you will find

00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:41,730
a better way of doing it or at least

00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:46,079
being able to track it better this this

00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:48,210
happens naturally please stitute so yeah

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,480
make them share the objects and try to

00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,190
formalize these api's and make it so

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,530
that you can build against it out some

00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,750
pig it Tigran fig and packaging and try

00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,780
to build against but read half drivers

00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:03,740
build outside and then the world will

00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:07,579
become quite a lot better and I hope

00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,579
anything else I was going this

00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:16,679
thanks to collar brie mode I have been a

00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:19,139
limb like yesterday twenty minutes short

00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:21,139
so questions and we can have a big

00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:24,419
discussion in five minutes perfectly

00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:27,449
maybe a comment about Lisa and gear icon

00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:29,729
I think from my perspective looking at

00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:33,539
the classic nasal drivers experience of

00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:35,279
radium it's really not correct to think

00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:36,989
of meeza as a shared library that you

00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:38,909
use the interface is so broad it's more

00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:41,249
like a toolbox for building drivers and

00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:43,559
so I think the splitting out is not

00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:45,569
really that people gallium is a

00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,009
different story but but Mesa I mean it's

00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:48,959
the same argument that the colonel guys

00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:51,389
have for for keeping drivers in the same

00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:53,249
tree is you really want to be able to

00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:57,630
change some of these data structures

00:39:53,249 --> 00:40:00,509
want to make modifications there as said

00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:02,339
gallium is already in a state where it

00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:04,139
might make more sense to go in this

00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:09,889
direction but for plastic how long have

00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:12,389
you been any person any of it I started

00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:15,839
pretty much when I start you all serve

00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:17,939
stories about Katie I GTI hours because

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,739
treatment and how it was pretty hard to

00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:22,529
get this even accepted or acknowledged

00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:24,809
by the kernel people at the time because

00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:28,439
graphics hardware is unbelievably

00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:30,239
unstable and there's a lot of WC when

00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:31,799
you see all the emails for from the

00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,179
colonel people at the moment there's a

00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:34,649
lot of stuff going back and forth

00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:36,359
between the colonel all the time out of

00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:38,429
a site I would love to be able to have

00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:40,259
all the radiant stuff and one single get

00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:42,509
free and not worry about these internal

00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:44,549
interfaces but the thing is that the

00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:48,659
interface to music or for the class of

00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:52,079
garbage is so big dicks itself is not

00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:53,609
that easy it's going to be bigger fix

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,919
itself everything everything that is

00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:58,889
eternity ex-driver this interface I

00:40:55,919 --> 00:41:00,250
think it might actually be bigger no

00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:04,070
nice

00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:07,220
silencing butterworth the tracks API is

00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:12,230
rubbish and incredibly old upon but nice

00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:15,350
a classic Italian a big aluminium

00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:18,500
marriage a yellow light it again more or

00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:21,200
less you can look at all of these state

00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,600
that the opengl spec describes and it's

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:28,970
in mesa plus some computer safety iconic

00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:32,210
it's big but it has it is a huge manage

00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:34,070
for doing extension enablement which you

00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,290
know we get pushed on on a regular basis

00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:40,010
of we want new extensions extensions

00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:41,660
features yes like so you don't have

00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,940
you're allowed to this table doesn't say

00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,490
i'm not doing more opengl or about the

00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,920
extension support and performance yeah

00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,810
and you're and photorealism get

00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,140
something over you can see a basis

00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:56,480
reflect what it needs to be to get the

00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,920
performance and features like if i have

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,140
to rinse and features this is what i'm

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,060
saying all the time if you let the

00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,370
people who want to build this or you

00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:06,190
want to update their current driver you

00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:08,630
at least give them what they have before

00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,920
you don't get them the new performance

00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,690
of their new features they don't want

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,610
this they want to fix their current

00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,710
issue they want to continue working and

00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:17,510
and to do it with the mesa stable

00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,210
ranches for that right if you want a

00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,820
small bug fix week yeah but then

00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:24,320
everybody else has to go and pull bug

00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,210
fixes and looking through all the change

00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,730
in app in there and pull doc fix it back

00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,290
if you have this zipper oh and i pull

00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:34,670
the bug fixes back in basic for my

00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:36,860
driver okay like it I you know I run the

00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,780
test suite i've got i write tests for

00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,150
fails to be have how do you do i even as

00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,400
we do i verify that my cherry picks

00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,200
areas the bugs if you have your driver

00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,270
external on a bid that work about a bag

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,860
disabling future or performance that's

00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:51,990
fine if you have this anyway then people

00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,550
using the relative whole charity there

00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:55,560
will be no bug fixes you have to back

00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,020
forth it just has to be careful about

00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,120
all the fuel and about the an extraction

00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,740
of the API that you build in order to

00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,230
work across all those different person

00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,780
to like we memorize this experiment in

00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:09,450
the intel driver and then we end up like

00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,730
i tried it in unicomm just now in this

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,230
building against these five persons or

00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:14,610
this side all the way to stay will

00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:17,460
stabilize few years ago they've been

00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:19,500
stable that's quite a long way a long

00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,210
time for myself and there's quite a few

00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,820
changes where I think what is really

00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:27,720
necessary what's this change really

00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:31,830
necessary and I'm just one guy yet and

00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:35,190
not for you Natasha and just one guy and

00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:37,080
I manage season 12 15 people I don't

00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:41,580
know how many people you have you see

00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:44,040
man and it's not you should be telling

00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:46,800
the the your clients to linux

00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,300
distribution vendors that they're having

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,560
a wrong business the system would not

00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:54,600
accept so any more questions before we

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,910
continue the discussion will give one

00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,910
from Harold

00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:23,570
yeah but what if if your drivers because

00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,800
eighty percent of the Bucks are going to

00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,680
be in the driver's anyway if your

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,060
drivers are backward compatible and can

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,670
be real pretty much in everything that's

00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:33,170
current then the package managers there

00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:35,300
will be package managers we will be

00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,400
doing this for you all the time users

00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,650
can this go and say hey let's update the

00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,560
latest package of this driver if they

00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:44,120
have an issue so tracking this tracking

00:44:42,560 --> 00:45:00,080
this will be done by package management

00:44:44,120 --> 00:45:02,450
first what I'm saying here Harold you're

00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,160
talking about the x server I'm talking

00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,380
about the driver and the driver can be

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,000
one big package it can be one big blog

00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,000
maybe even broken up into

00:45:26,709 --> 00:45:35,569
auto comp is doing this for me auto comp

00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:37,819
is suspected is taking all this well you

00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:41,569
do good you're all talking about the

00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:43,160
inside word so I management it's of just

00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:45,829
a proof of concept it was the really

00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,689
easy thing to do and it's something that

00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:49,189
allows me to move very fast and future

00:45:47,689 --> 00:45:51,079
with unichrome ago it was the really

00:45:49,189 --> 00:45:53,119
easy thing to probably unichrome is the

00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:55,999
only hard way that still sells for you

00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:58,339
to do this for that easily but on the

00:45:55,999 --> 00:46:00,410
other hand intel there's an enormous

00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:04,549
amount of manpower dare you should

00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:09,099
manage them they support a lot more

00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:11,449
hardware than you were in Venice then

00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:13,189
they support a lot more features of

00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:15,859
course but I support all the hardware

00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:17,809
that's on it yeah but that's a lot more

00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:20,029
Intel hardware and then maybe Carly

00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:22,069
muffler shortly I'm making that

00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:24,920
amazingly well as a unique home easily

00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:26,509
and watched twenty percent of the market

00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:31,039
and speaking right when you were single

00:46:26,509 --> 00:46:34,009
year so like I similar what about love

00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:36,759
 yeah of course in your role that's

00:46:34,009 --> 00:46:36,759
its ruling everything

00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:48,700
very mad at us there's rotating you can

00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:51,940
install stable and you can do the trick

00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:56,670
with based on results the show once cut

00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:56,670
