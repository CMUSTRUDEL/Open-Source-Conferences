so everybody please welcome to thank you

00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:18,029
this one guy so I'm that's me I'm from

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:21,000
the deli mother so I'm biased in place

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,320
so you have experienced pilot is usually

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,429
what they already doing the other now

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:33,770
face catoon so I'm learning system you

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:38,040
should just flow k / talking about so

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:41,370
the I think most of us spend most of our

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,100
time on right now is situating a great

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,370
open source off way to some citizen that

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,770
works well together and we have policies

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,649
file systems downloads and then much fun

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,539
things like that so that is what we're

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,140
currently doing I think what actually

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,770
started more is to actually get the

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,500
software to the user right now it's

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,659
pretty easy because everyone is internet

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,909
but it it used to be more difficult

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,830
actually do original linux distribution

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,360
subpoena for so policies or welted nice

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,360
integration it just had some binding

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,450
12oz paths going on a medium and

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,200
interviews or so that there is another

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:29,100
task indeed to some degree ed up Burt

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,479
task of Linux distributors to be the

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,659
implementers of the guardians of

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,189
freedoms dead your various organizations

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,640
such as free software foundation or the

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,140
Open Source Initiative have defined you

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,340
know they put him on the paper on the

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,329
internet but it's actually the

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,579
distribution which you have to or should

00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:51,740
follow that it actually provides those

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:55,049
freedoms tonizzle so and then the other

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,240
part of the park is what what is it

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,909
cloud and whatnot disrepair it's a bunch

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,590
of definitions around them this is my

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,820
attention

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:09,430
now so this is something I hold together

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:12,400
so it's provisioning of services hosted

00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,930
or share resources of the internet so

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,190
there's couple part 01 is sort of the

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,170
provision images disables of

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:23,440
distributing perhaps and the hosting on

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,630
shared resources social vision something

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,180
that goes into that this whole thing

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,430
happens over the Internet and then

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,770
there's also these things for private

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,810
files which is then look not all the

00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:38,320
internet so you basically have the

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:41,620
provisioning chef will be resources and

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:47,590
virtualization additional perhaps that's

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:54,040
it's called a proverb bug so the so this

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:56,980
might even first miss you maybe 15 years

00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:02,020
ago so that's what people visit either

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:04,780
they took binary totals yes then then

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:11,709
send them around or any alternative

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:14,140
perhaps if that's what I'm actually open

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,330
one of these so that's what you meant

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,060
back then I can just download it on the

00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:24,910
telephone network and then to install

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:26,830
linux operating system locally and so

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,150
that as essence and as i said that was

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,650
all the task what the early linux

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,790
distributions to get written software

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:37,840
okay then whether people started doing

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:42,459
is is put these things into disks boxes

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:47,290
like this bunch of other ones also like

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:49,600
this you can recognize yeah and you know

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,299
put manuals in there then you can boil

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,970
then we can shut the wrong or i can buy

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,160
them in the shops at bookshop CD hoping

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,260
that actually that exists anymore to or

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,830
should we you can promise to all of them

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,830
but i don't make me

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,300
then as the stock grow then use these

00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,800
kind of media and if they kept growing

00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,540
and approachable she needs it now it's

00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,180
like this many CDs or you can use in

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:16,480
ease and then there's five or six afford

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,060
any I guess you can just do right now is

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,919
just one so but you know this is just

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:26,770
accumulate you can let an accumulator

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:30,520
but it isn't really a sort of help

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,690
people because the latest devices that

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,700
we have now they don't actually have

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,850
seen you guys anymore I just want I hope

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:40,450
so because you have have you police for

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:44,080
I think you probably use these sticks

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:47,050
but you can't actually what you could

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,480
but you know really sell or distribute

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,910
it was nice if you can fly them

00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:57,550
themselves and then be another device

00:04:51,910 --> 00:05:01,960
very much honored if you don't see any

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,970
driver people so that's let's so we're

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,250
we're now and then certainly this will

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,600
continue to exist right because you

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,060
still need to destroy your that's all

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,040
we're laptop there's still people in

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,110
other parts of the world who don't have

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,870
a broadband internet and you just want

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,490
to put some learning software school

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,539
computers admits up there leave

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:26,140
differently infrastructure what does

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:29,740
what what we have now mostly is this or

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:32,410
this at home I'd this is a dsl so we

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:37,990
meet me download everything we don't

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:41,890
need any media anymore but many of these

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,419
all things and so how do you solve it

00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,000
obviously will do that in their

00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:49,479
solutions for that but it's all at on

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,009
there and you don't think of these was

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:57,020
we have seen each oximeters

00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:58,279
you can move them yourself ice and then

00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,990
people would write like some automation

00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,930
for that people there on the ocean but

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,960
so what the cloud idea how is actually

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:11,089
this is not your idea so this is Amazon

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,460
Rackspace and shopping the person what

00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:16,699
you don't go there from this whole shop

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,939
and they do give you some pre-made

00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:22,129
images you can install that they are

00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:23,479
that's what they tell you to use what

00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:26,539
you can also tell you oh my gift is our

00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:30,129
big ambitions against or another thing

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:33,050
that's sort of the popular right now is

00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:37,270
personal very special thing commercial

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,830
policy level it's often run locally and

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,909
how do you solve these walls I think the

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,740
way it works right now actually you

00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:46,219
download the ISO dimensions and multi is

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,870
admission that they pulled it up as a

00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:49,939
regular operating system which seems

00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,080
kind of stupid actually we think just

00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:54,379
maybe you should just give the download

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,229
or karate which is just had now

00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:00,499
obviously exists we split up and maybe

00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:02,870
that should ectomy something a linux

00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:05,319
distribution just give us something from

00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,580
your product instead of in high so much

00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,039
because installing these sort of things

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,599
locally you know you fire marshall box

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,279
and you download the thing you can mount

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,959
it in and pull it up peopled up again

00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,269
that makes all padded install the esata

00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,360
software again it so it seems kind of

00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:25,930
ridiculous take you half an hour and

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:28,249
make sure to be in government wanted so

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,529
there are some solutions for that so you

00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:31,969
just first you make up something to show

00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:36,639
but every Gator Center probably has

00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:39,050
something at images VMR sell something

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:44,300
means something after dash bunch of

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:46,009
things available completely diverse some

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,019
interesting so approaches that are also

00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,449
free software and someone who are

00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:53,360
integrated with the new situations

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:56,199
example so from the debit world but they

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,550
also support other operating systems

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,199
NPRM five is fully automated

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,800
installation you want to check that out

00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,800
at zero

00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:07,349
that's all worked out a set up a sober

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,479
and put some image in the congregation

00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:13,259
and Buddha ball machines and they fetch

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:16,049
this I'll fire the HTTP and tftp in

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,369
sermons over that that works maybe for

00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:19,559
your own data sogndal but it doesn't

00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:21,059
really help you don't really put stuff

00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:23,219
in the qualities you can with your own

00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:27,899
tht please around and then these are

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:32,789
things it doesn't work so as I actually

00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:36,000
don't need it is so new idea to to think

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:41,909
itself point addition to it is putting

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,050
on ISO images why not just to contribute

00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,379
in some way it needs me to go out

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:49,290
obviously between suspenseful virtualbox

00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:51,329
images or some standard problem is there

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,949
are no standards for that so that means

00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:55,410
before lunch if I know distribute all

00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:58,110
virtual wall thickness as if when you

00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,300
make a list for example you can download

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:07,980
them put them on your chin sap in one

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:10,259
minute or do some itself you know

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,220
downloading images of various kind you

00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,709
just have some kind of servers

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,279
integrated in your linux distribution

00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:20,389
offering website something you say well

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,459
i want a machine and put a dick that's

00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:26,790
word sugar that's sort of the promise of

00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:28,470
the family can be up in a bit you

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,050
obviously have to set up you know like

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,110
an account with his on make sure you can

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,059
paint so once you have that you need to

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:41,819
say well this is what I want what is

00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:44,939
there in this age exist Vanessa sexually

00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:48,209
I have I don't work for butcher this for

00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:50,519
something I found itself and this is

00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,980
pretty much actually what the size of

00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:57,360
this I think it were things coming

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:59,080
together this is a is actually probably

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:05,380
put you in France follow

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:08,810
it's based on the free software and all

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,250
this and this is baby how it works or if

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,960
you install this sort of management

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:18,590
thing and he said only covered with

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:23,090
amazon and or you have a private club

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:24,800
and the ninja skill i just a web

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,600
interface and you just look like what

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,910
notice and i want to know answer or they

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,190
can't see them I want a new answers it's

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,160
that name and you set up some access key

00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,970
or password do some pretty funky hey if

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:42,380
they say well but that's my machine and

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:43,730
that works and i don't know if anyone

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,290
else actually offers that right now I

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:51,190
think that's still where the things of

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:51,190
any other state will notice

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:58,490
so problems i mentioned is bolder some

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,790
emerging standards you could say but

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,040
there's only selling this day this is an

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,800
image one minute applicants or deploy or

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,650
something there are some reading members

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,820
like Rackspace lands on well no that's

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:16,730
sort of bored fighting this presumably

00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,000
in a furious other words i should have

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,100
to walk out of that we've middle away

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,220
there are some libraries around like

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,990
this port for example that can abstract

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,700
away somehow it miss essentially used

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,710
also with this welcome to marys other

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,130
pieces that strap that way but the

00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:36,860
obvious when the next member comes out

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:41,330
adjusted there's still something we have

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:45,830
walking so the other thing is bunch of

00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:48,020
software also free software that can

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,720
manage all that right relation to put it

00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,960
there the query once they have managed

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,610
the whole thing to do monitoring bunch

00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,980
of things in allergic it also out there

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,260
as it is typically there's one website

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,600
is another one could put them all

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,140
together and how those benefits to fit

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,490
together it's a lot of work and so as i

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,430
mentioned in beginning so linux

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:17,390
distributions ought to be it's a bit of

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:23,080
that and then that's surely already

00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:23,080
happening that needs to do more that

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:31,500
you just maybe I download the latest of

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,570
X and it has all the software and it's

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,339
not going to be anybody dude that's one

00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,200
of things are going to go another

00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,529
problem I think that most of this is all

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,920
a web application packaging of web

00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,360
applicators traditionally the problem

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,730
for various technical reasons and

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,709
people's of by now afraid of them gets

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,380
their security problems in this amounts

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:54,149
or packaging the web application is

00:12:52,380 --> 00:13:02,399
available from the line problem that

00:12:54,149 --> 00:13:04,850
perhaps so here are some links that

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:10,470
contain all things to all things to

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:12,899
interesting ideas about this this

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:16,769
eucalyptus thing is the sort of the

00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:20,399
leading I would say don't need anything

00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:22,290
most popular provisioning management

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,839
software suppose that actually was once

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,360
this will Cooper to cloud thing that's

00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,480
open source you can download a shelf

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,800
action set up this whole vacation you

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,470
need to staff it in same thing and there

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,360
are some to block codes i found

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,380
interesting the head works of a lot of

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,490
notes or snug-fitting projects to watch

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,800
contains links to other source offer

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:53,930
that support this and here's another

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:57,529
interesting so that's the part 1 of this

00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,529
any questions are for

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:12,440
so the second part of this is the so to

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,920
some degree right linux is now leading

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,950
silver operating system meeting I had an

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,200
operating system that stuff's been that

00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,170
was a bit of a problem at Mario's here

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,940
of the Linux desktop am devoting your

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,410
two years ago they took i was able sort

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,050
of i think when the links decibel

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,500
actually fail when all these netbooks

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:36,050
came out on it most you netbooks had

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,290
some linux driving on any two months

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,970
later they all switch back to the list

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:44,900
that was all of the peak of the linux

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,460
desktop but actually let me start so

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,970
this is here now but it's not what we

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:55,640
really trust hope for it look like this

00:14:49,970 --> 00:15:00,230
now and that is for the other person has

00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,220
that's google chrome OS based on the

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,230
links you normally to go through

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,410
checkbox innings at all free and open

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:10,130
and everything it does actually contain

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:14,950
into software because all the edging all

00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:19,190
these applications are they okay are

00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:22,070
these websites there is a portion of the

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:28,190
way google let's go that's not personal

00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:30,530
they wanna i need an army and so did I

00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:33,200
guess you can go see this gmail hotmail

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:37,790
yahoo mail google calendar will get our

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,650
google docs youtube cut so let's try for

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,280
getting very partial social work so

00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:44,660
directly so much to do list and

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,980
calculate all of the calculator is

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:51,110
actually local books chess facebook so

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,200
that's that's the applications of the

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:59,120
sugar i suppose and so this is obviously

00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,470
Google some way of the way they think

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,570
things are going to be but if you look

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:06,750
around maybe you give linux desktop

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:09,170
that family member and I've done that

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,240
they started using it without any

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:15,030
problems and it's not because you know I

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,680
like lxde is so mean most user-friendly

00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,570
thing in the world that's just fitting

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,650
because what they do this firefox and

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:26,730
openoffice basically right and then but

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:28,230
even if you're not so Google this is

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,920
what people out there actually using it

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:34,500
or not the hackers that have the iron

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,690
from Malta barbers and this is what

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,770
people actually using it so is

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:45,510
Wellington I go but where does it

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:48,120
actually leave the next is yours it's

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:52,440
what you actually shipped to the US or

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,550
now is basically just the frame around

00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,870
this way and then you don't have any

00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:03,180
control over what these things no more

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:09,060
and so if we're going to set the late

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:10,260
bus and be cause we are right we don't

00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,910
have anything to distribute anymore

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,459
except the box around it we have no

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:21,209
nothing to enjoy it we've no controlling

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:25,339
the freedoms that we were supposed to

00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,339
force or infinitely provide

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:32,410
so here this problem is basically a

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,740
suicide software that is not for you

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:39,309
Hillary our sides you know where the

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,500
software is tightening free but there

00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,670
are some other factors you doing when

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,820
they tell you well this is this awkward

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,710
it's when you download suit yourself

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:53,760
maybe the hosting is not free i don't

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:56,110
know if what could that mean but because

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,250
it can tell you this is the sort but you

00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,900
don't know if that's actually a source

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:03,760
of running what they have any extensions

00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:09,340
in there you don't know what's happening

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,260
to your data and you know even if they

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,880
sable you protect your privacy this and

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:19,380
that as you all know there's all these

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:22,210
leaks this changed policy there's no

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,100
open source community in the senseo

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,320
there's no peer review of things are

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:30,370
going on but they put feedback

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,220
mechanisms just shared reporting and

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:37,030
fixing sort of things it's not strictly

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,710
necessary of to have free software

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,140
project but it still sort of recognized

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,850
as a component that you have this

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,309
software engineering methodology as

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,100
opposed either so this what was

00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:52,290
fortunately you don't really only that

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,290
if you can all use this facebook genius

00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:05,650
so how could this mean that so it's a

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:16,060
first of all we need more of the free

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:16,060
web services because in others jamail

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,800
well people use that there's no pickle

00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,990
under that it's quick software of course

00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,940
they have some web application at

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:29,570
webmail or application but they're not

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,900
nearly to nicer a little one software

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:35,030
needs to be written and yesterday

00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,920
actually the I was a talk or the

00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:41,900
national hero and some neighborhood but

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:46,030
it in Mozilla folks they said that you

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,900
know the web is inherently hackable

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:52,250
because he had the source told me

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:55,760
everything it's true to some degree but

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,620
it's I hope things actually little too

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,000
of course you at the source code but

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:03,320
Eddie I actually looked at source code

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,640
of a complex web application might as

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,040
well argue well you know you could

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,030
connect anything because you can reverse

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:15,680
assemble it will help and even if you

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:17,360
can a get maybe not legal so any it's

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,470
just budget new software that needs to

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,330
be written to fit into you know what

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,490
people want to use but there are some

00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:26,600
things that are already going in that

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:30,290
direction I didn't because the Twitter

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:33,520
or placement into my alternative example

00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,520
openstreetmap is gone

00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:43,009
to new things from que es own cloud

00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:45,230
mobile initiative right now and make

00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:49,450
sure the product but they were thinking

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:51,320
of ways to make their software

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,049
accessible no needs to be just a bunch

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:57,710
of more things in that area we don't

00:20:54,049 --> 00:21:00,799
have any web office type things for

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,539
example in that obviously there would be

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,100
a huge job so it's not going to happen

00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:09,200
to the next three months as opposed to

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:14,980
example so think more of you know what

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:18,139
you can do to not the place but to have

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,019
alternatives to say no bill instead of

00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:23,330
alternative to microsoft because i was

00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:24,859
totally bakes of gold throughout the

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,919
nineties perhaps you know everything

00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:29,980
that microsoft word l diesel company

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,279
said needs to have a free emplacement

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:36,619
operating systems done there's office

00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:38,450
that's done more or less a geologist

00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:41,239
that's what people think that's kind of

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,409
finished right now posted as Paul the

00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:44,509
issues and various things like that

00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:46,249
let's go don't know but in the meantime

00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:49,129
actually the whole this whole new

00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:51,190
fielded open up web applications that

00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:54,919
are driven by mostly Google another

00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,899
other companies and there's no really

00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,519
credible credible alternatives to watch

00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:05,499
on that sometimes those are good sports

00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:07,999
so the second we need some kind of a

00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:09,889
free hosting moment it's very hard to

00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:14,359
figure out how to actually do that so

00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:17,509
let's think if I am a user of free

00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:20,720
software and I want you to need to make

00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:23,359
use my freedoms and when I can download

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,789
the source from the original authority

00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:30,350
you know the packaging I can rebuild

00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:32,389
with myself I can do changes and then

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:36,019
use those chambers change birds that's

00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:41,299
all things we do right but how do you do

00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:43,380
that with for the web service even if

00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:45,790
you have a free one you know

00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,380
of course I need to software needs to be

00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:50,760
free first once you can actually look at

00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:54,360
it so then how do you say you have

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,890
obviously you want to make some change

00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:01,480
you don't like the way from the change

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:04,780
the college how do you do that can't go

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,940
to SD Burman let's go there and check

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,160
the source / that's actually running and

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:13,059
then make changes there then have it was

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,620
there but doesn't work right so it's you

00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:17,980
can get the source code perhaps and you

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:22,809
can get the data dump from them then you

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:24,970
need to pay full hosting yourself how is

00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:26,980
infeasible it's not absolutely the same

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,679
idea that that the same offer a

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,320
builder's running unchanged you need to

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,350
set up the audio my openstreetmap organ

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,870
meat do you think sarin obviously that

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,040
doesn't scale you know 100,000 users

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,360
wonder they cannot change it I'm

00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,320
merchant back together it's something I

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:48,460
like well I go get thousand

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:50,200
openstreetmap phones so I don't know how

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,929
that actually network but it's something

00:23:50,200 --> 00:24:00,429
it there are possible ways to do it

00:23:54,929 --> 00:24:01,840
virtualization and could have obese

00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:04,450
treatment for example pretends like the

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,919
virtualization posting alternative

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,720
branches let's come from a contentious

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,630
or kick around making changes upload

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,910
them in the episode in the subdomain I'm

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:17,140
not sure that helps but I don't know if

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:18,760
he's thinking there's a example that

00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,940
it's not really think that's in this

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,309
completely that sort of idea of that

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:27,070
community hostings host sharing done

00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:33,039
that is a German ice be arrested for

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:34,899
dns but it's a non-profit Association

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,480
and you can still become a member there

00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:39,480
only sort of joints eternity man if you

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,889
run the thing as a community to some

00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,639
degree so that pretty useful or so to

00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:50,440
sort of little draw experiences from but

00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:55,090
as I said this is very unclear how that

00:24:50,440 --> 00:25:00,419
can actually work so the next thing is

00:24:55,090 --> 00:25:02,769
some sort of the whole issue of bail

00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:08,110
which is not a problem if you have those

00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:10,149
local installations with the traditional

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,350
way of using power for you have this

00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:12,940
software on your own machine and you

00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,100
worry about using software free and then

00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:18,639
can I change it but data is always there

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,200
and sometimes it's in the format it you

00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:22,210
don't like if you always have to source

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,679
it meets the format so you can access

00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,149
that but if the software's actually

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,639
deployed somewhere else into the data

00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:30,509
they are cans they will get to them so

00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:35,350
then it's some sort of policy or some

00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:38,139
ways to to you know you can you a check

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,970
what's happening to data and he actually

00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:43,990
get your data out of there to use it in

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:46,029
a different context for example and so

00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,309
that is some kind of make wallets again

00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:50,590
depends on how is hosting works out you

00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:53,230
know you can't give every user as HX x

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,299
into that box let them check the logs

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,100
and what's happened to the data but

00:25:55,299 --> 00:26:00,419
ultimately as a user lips when I would

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:05,700
light but it's very impractical for that

00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,700
data dumps or actually already have

00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:20,409
and there is this notion in the GPL for

00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:22,799
example a new meet you know the GPL

00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:25,119
revised in some circumstances brightly

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,389
source code to the recipient of the

00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,549
software it has this notion of preferred

00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:33,330
form for modification but you can't just

00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:36,269
give them some random miss four minutes

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,559
pre-built binary semi compiled version

00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:41,350
you to actually give them the source

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,269
that you were using to a reasonable

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,609
person I suppose with useful what if I

00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,769
pursue the same would apply here in

00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:50,320
potentially that you know you need to

00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:52,809
provide access to the data in some

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,210
preferred form so it can just be able

00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:58,239
binary tons of control data for negative

00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:00,609
maybe some recognize format so that is

00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:03,820
pretty easy to define I think of people

00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:06,999
or using so that's that's pretty simple

00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:10,690
or at least a little exercise here and

00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:15,489
the last the thing to think about this

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:20,799
is licensing in a licensing that sort of

00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:22,950
forces these issues here and there is

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,799
some there's already a mission see

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:28,090
someone you will know an attempt to do

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,899
that it's somewhat controversial but I

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:35,799
think it's all does the job or a lot of

00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:39,669
cases that's the ancient PA Fero general

00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:43,210
public license and that basically says

00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:44,950
it's a GPL plus if you provide this

00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:47,440
software as a web service I'm

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,970
summarizing but it basically says is GPL

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,159
class they divided the software as a web

00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:54,429
service and change it need to make a

00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:57,789
change available to download over a

00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:58,790
network or you know all I written offer

00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:02,429
to ship

00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:03,990
internet so that essentially gets the

00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:09,480
job done if you think about something

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:11,940
like you know maybe identical they if

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,870
you had an identical right I can't be

00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,309
that actually make that 15 is ok if you

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,470
had actually went identica then someone

00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:23,120
took it actually hosted it make some

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:25,320
changes they would be required to put

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,550
tumbleon ever sent download that I think

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,780
that makes quite a bit of sense but

00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,090
there are some practical problems that

00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,760
type in I should do for example what if

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:37,200
you use some agb a GPL licensed software

00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:42,240
to implement or change a mail server

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:49,950
smtp server how do you make an smtp

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:51,900
server offer code for download no one

00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,840
knows the answer to that is it license

00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:58,320
does it say that you have to get over it

00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,850
could put a link in the was it the smtp

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,080
welcome message and but that doesn't

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:06,059
really sad but it doesn't actually

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:07,350
practice her use or so but they also the

00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:12,170
Free Software Foundation has actually

00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:14,340
proved this so involved some significant

00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,900
projects or products in using that so

00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:20,130
that I think that's the way sort of my

00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:22,470
google potentially you know how this was

00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,970
like 10 15 years ago and sort of this

00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,530
free open-source off that took off

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,210
everyone license because they thought

00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:31,860
you know this is best way to actually

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:36,450
enforce what I want and over time is has

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:40,050
consolidated and maybe you already

00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,369
consolidated now or maybe there's going

00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,379
to be more things

00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:48,700
no chairs none of this happens of course

00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:55,029
also possible so look for something like

00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:57,309
so licensing issues later so now I think

00:29:55,029 --> 00:30:00,099
actually saw these things are not going

00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:03,789
to sort of get the importance a deadly

00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:06,989
fedora and so just it nice difficult to

00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:10,419
arrange you have made the statements on

00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:13,440
policies and licenses posting and so on

00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:16,059
I think this would you know the

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,149
opportunity for commercial vendors of

00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:21,909
these distributions and so on same way

00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:26,200
early Ling Ling sis reached at least any

00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:28,809
other commercial members right that's

00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,739
what you know the way they write had to

00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:34,090
get started they assembled software and

00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:36,159
packaged a little bit and then they

00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:40,090
charge for that to give that to you if I

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:44,669
be paid to know how much it was some is

00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:47,859
yours other crewmen see actual better so

00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:49,899
to get that box and over time this will

00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:51,460
sort of commoditize because yet you know

00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:52,869
brought that download and how he just

00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,149
downloaded things we can't go to charge

00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:57,970
that anymore now it's all open I hope

00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:59,669
this for the long and so on which

00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:02,379
everything could happen here that some

00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:04,210
members and your butcher canonical is

00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:06,389
essentially do now ready to just sort of

00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,889
define some of these things and then

00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:15,519
make things happen are talking Ford and

00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:18,309
over time is as we go on there could be

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,070
feel free completely free community

00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:25,529
driven alternatives to that appear it's

00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,529
a mess you know this resolved

00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:38,090
so these are necessary adverse with free

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:42,020
software position and this is the

00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:44,960
commune of the 80s actually this is what

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,929
we've been using so far this is the

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,419
foundation of you know the open source

00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:53,809
definition so my dad likes it so now all

00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:57,350
this one comes from that in that so this

00:31:53,809 --> 00:32:00,860
will still work I think if you want to

00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:02,150
let's take what a lot source what I'm

00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:06,860
afraid to ride you won't have to keep

00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:08,270
the change there's some trouble here you

00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,919
want to have the freedom to change

00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,530
initially and redeploy that change

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,240
burden in the state environment as I

00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:17,030
mentioned this is very difficult you

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,950
look right now you can redistribute it

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:23,990
both in yourself and can distribute

00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:28,580
whatever changes so this is the well I

00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:29,809
think there's some additions to that

00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,280
should be thought other people are

00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:34,850
thinking about that so this is sort of

00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:38,780
the idea here the issue of data is is

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:41,750
very important I think that it was

00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:44,140
actually across them many years where

00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:46,030
the Tim O'Reilly was actually

00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:49,320
going on about control data this could

00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:55,800
be important and then this was kind of a

00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,800
nation now it's more from the devil so

00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:01,480
you know I don't want to say oh this is

00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:03,220
before what I do is I don't want because

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,950
I'm just until we find for a definition

00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:09,420
right now but i think this somehow needs

00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,420
to be integrated into the various

00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:16,600
licensing policies and then there is

00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:19,000
things like that and i hope you and is

00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:25,830
really address it literally recognize

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:32,190
play right now so here are some links

00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:32,190
it's a nice blog entry body see here

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,620
this is very nice blog entry who I where

00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,800
he actually went through the various of

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,630
freedoms and rights him about to happen

00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:48,010
and compare various services like

00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:51,270
Facebook identical I email and make like

00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:54,460
that against that I'm actually this

00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:56,920
well-known person had a talk freedom in

00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,470
the cloud on Friday actually i have not

00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:03,340
seen it but obviously it's kind of the

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:05,020
same idea now check this morning the

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:09,010
video wasn't up yet but there was a link

00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:11,530
that you're coming be very interesting

00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:14,340
to look into it if you just Google this

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:18,010
exactly I don't know a lot

00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:21,660
hearing this but if you want to search

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:24,880
with the research one choice for this

00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:32,880
you will find it very interesting I ever

00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:35,350
said I cannot see it so to conclude this

00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,480
you know you can just ignore that is how

00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:43,390
people do it but ultimately this will

00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:45,910
make linux distribution or channelize

00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:48,670
perhaps for all the people will do it in

00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:50,830
ways you what might a stable not it

00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:54,430
means to simple of standards of freedom

00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:57,190
and immigration so on sir think about

00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:58,960
what would you know in your project and

00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,880
so I know people work on so how can you

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,460
take all this cloud supper maybe buy a

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,870
new Power Cell for integrated to make it

00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:09,550
a nice package that you can now then

00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,920
shifting users in the way they would

00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:17,110
expect an hour sort of need a couple

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,580
years from now and same bad wasted new

00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:22,660
ways to distribute software instead of

00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:25,300
shooting a nice images download the ISO

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:30,010
image burn a CD install them into a CD

00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:32,940
waiters think about new ways in this

00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:37,300
should be software and think about

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:41,980
freedom in the cloud maybe look at a

00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:45,850
talk or think of new ways to automatics

00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:49,420
together definitions of freedom that

00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:51,370
usually salsa and as Linux distributions

00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:55,140
I think we should be at the center of

00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:55,140
this drive

00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:08,040
there's one have the eucalyptus price

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:12,450
for that the progress they install

00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:15,030
virtual machines from scratch as much I

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:19,350
right click on the space walk between

00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:21,240
that and what I'm space walk I don't

00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,460
know that so much the question wasn't

00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:31,140
this you put this similar space why

00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:33,960
don't you know spaceball problems and so

00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,340
and yeah I don't know this is something

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,410
that you figure out in what about

00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:40,500
afterwards what the eucalyptus actually

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:43,380
does is this like this mean shut up in

00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,720
case it's facing the very place to say i

00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,750
want this sort machine and want to

00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:54,990
install it to a amazon would be my

00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:59,190
private cloud Parker sort of finer

00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:02,100
granularity of the package because he

00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:11,910
look at the crossover certainly there's

00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:13,740
convene a 15 packages oh yes I was just

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:17,240
good guys three days ago and they said

00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,240
to me that arrogance and I

00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:49,540
you mean like a P is for the point

00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,680
ulcers and things like that yes there's

00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,750
only question was there's a working

00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,670
group how to define cloudiest so there

00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:57,670
are standardization efforts technology

00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:59,950
people say that the IETF and so on and I

00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,410
think about ways to standardize various

00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:07,120
interfaces to these services so this is

00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:08,800
work going on and to to be followed yes

00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:18,210
it's all happening right now so that's

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:18,210
