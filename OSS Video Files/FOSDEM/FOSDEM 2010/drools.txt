	00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,139
what engineers the capabilities the

00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:14,059
breadth of the stuff without hopefully

00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,710
losing anyone that going to dance is

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:17,689
going to quite intense they're always

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,630
looking go to sleep you can get a ruby

00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:24,169
session well DeRozan okay so let's get

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,450
started so drools it's made up currently

00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:29,090
of for Megan's governor which is about

00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,460
the server side management or bring all

00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,010
the web stuff the operations expert is

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,230
now the rule engine side is the logic

00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:40,640
sitefusion is for the event processing

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,830
side and flow is we start off a thing

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,330
called a role play and it became quite

00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,660
quickly August that the rules and

00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:50,030
workflow sit side by side so just pass

00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,270
it down can someone just pass the little

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,460
key down thank you so flows extend that

00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,440
hands are full blowing as the topics

00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,550
days drilled expert quick examples

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,590
little deeper drills blow a very very

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,840
small naturals flow that have much time

00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,820
back on the drawers expert in just over

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,460
two timers calendars parents treat

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,649
medicines and drills fusion if we get

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,859
time see how it go right so back and

00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:17,060
start the book class applicants everyone

00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,280
should understand what is i put the

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,409
guests ancestors in there we have is a

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,840
valid age it's simply saying where the

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:27,020
applicant is age less than eighteen and

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,060
we set the value equals pops very simple

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,359
everybody understands the rules are off

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,780
that form website is matched when we

00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:42,319
recognize a set of data we can execute

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:44,779
on that draws has become beyond just

00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,880
rules we start to include workflows i'll

00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:49,909
include class definitions we get it to

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,029
build a generic aprm knowledge your

00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,859
these things are uh knowledge and your

00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:58,459
building knowledge deposition so your

00:01:54,859 --> 00:02:00,590
rules your workflow your car Stephanie's

00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:02,630
we call type declarations or all types

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,249
of definitions so you have a knowledge

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,139
builder to build these definitions and

00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,500
first thing you do is create a lot is

00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:11,480
build up and then you just keep adding

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,910
different resources these resources so

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,220
let's say this is a rule

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,730
a resource type of definitions rules if

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,500
you wanted to load in a workflow the

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,230
only thing that would change is that a

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,510
go to dr f of blind so we got a generic

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,480
API allow you to load and build lots

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,940
different types of much simple way to do

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,260
the validation and then you just put up

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,010
the knowledge base the knowledge bases

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,810
the compiled x could reform of all this

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,240
knowledge one of the things is different

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,470
sorry you do not choose the engine which

00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,960
introduced on you build your knowledge

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,580
base and then execute for tapas we're

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,110
executing the flow engine or the rule

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:54,520
engine is all taken care of and visibly

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:57,070
we have this is spring integration so

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,020
this is the XML equivalence of what you

00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,850
just saw there so what is it doing is to

00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,000
see how resources of a rule flow type

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:08,620
from that particular URL it's also

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,760
adding in a decision table it could also

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,530
add in the room first and build up a

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,850
knowledge base of all these different

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,820
types of knowledge is all compiled into

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:18,070
one executable form we then build

00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,800
sessions from these so the sessions is

00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,480
the short-term way to operate on that

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,550
you can think of in process terms of

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,040
process definition the process instance

00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,830
in rules terms it's the rule base and

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,800
the working memory we use the word

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,970
sessions rain generic way of working

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,130
with this once you have everything

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,810
within spring you can then get camel

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,220
integration for out-of-the-box services

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,010
some work with the moment so camera

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,950
allows you to shave together what they

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,350
call processes kick those up to web

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:50,530
services HTTP and then you can channel

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,970
those into your case session ones allows

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,870
you to get declarative session

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,950
out-of-the-box rules workflow what

00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,570
everyone and there's just specifies the

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,000
type of incoming data transformation

00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,890
it's that simple running behind some

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,860
really so let's go into a bit more on

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,570
the example you saw you saw the how do

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,910
the definitions how you build

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,459
definitions and executing this just

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,400
stateless session stateless means that

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,410
it is something that executes once is

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,930
thrown away a second function you give

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,940
it the data and execute and when it

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,640
finished executing it returns so it's

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:27,010
very simple you get the session you get

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,360
your data you were just doing a little

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,570
bit assertion here just checking the day

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,130
before we execute on our session I are

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,770
working memory of our process instance

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,060
we execute on the session that returns

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,300
now we can check the values this is a

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,800
very simple way like common in

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,300
validation mortgage applications

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,340
insurance of processing your data so

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,320
there's going to be more complex now you

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,539
have a room your sprinklers you have a

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,020
fire and alarms this is for gluing your

00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:58,140
definitions for a fire control system to

00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,890
know the first rule when there's a rule

00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,220
listen when there is a five-time

00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,240
sprinkles on so there's a fire these are

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,590
binding smuggler they give you a

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,710
reference to a field a reference to the

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,140
object and we make a joint between the

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,560
fire and sprinkler uncouple tomariians

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,410
later on and anise pulse this spring is

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,430
not on return the sprinkler on telling

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,640
the sprinkler the room number of

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,620
notification when the fire is gone turn

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,990
off the sprinkler so what we have now is

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,090
the difference there's honest else on is

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,500
true and we've checked them here when

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,280
there is no farmer the fire does not

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,450
exist then we turn the sprinkler off I

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,800
will come out a bit more for those who

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,810
have been confused about the bindings of

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:43,210
stuff in a minutes so not only do no

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,090
sprinklers on offer at room we want to

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,039
be able to raise alarms now we don't

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,500
want to have an alarm at every time as a

00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,450
foreign room so we have some we saw I'm

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,660
not sit when there's no farm now exists

00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,130
so when there is one or more fire doing

00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,060
alarm but only good for first time

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,700
there's a fire and the same when when

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,960
there are no more fires in the building

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,430
turn the alarm off retract it's it's a

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,650
way of being up to do with collection

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,020
sixth and it's called first order logic

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,910
for anyone who's an academic terms and

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,520
finally when there are no alarms and

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:19,930
when no sprinkler is on Sarah is okay

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,400
this would just basically for these

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,960
different rooms put them into the

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,090
working memory I will put these slides

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,190
online then have time to go through it

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,470
line by line so basically that's all the

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,960
data into the session into the working

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,960
memory and cause fire or rules and

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,190
that's paid when you put stuff in

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,190
to the engine especially the rule side

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,870
the the calculations done then that not

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,759
make consequences only actions are

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,800
executed until you tell it to here and

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,080
basically runs through insist everything

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:51,330
is ok if we then create a fire and we're

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,430
going to tell it there is a fire kitchen

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,830
fire and a fire in the office it's a

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,900
firewall rules and raised it on time

00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,360
sprinkle on for the kitchen room turn

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:05,220
the sprinkler on to the office if we

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,960
then turn the remove the fire the

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,150
kitchen roof with Barabbas and the tent

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,070
to go again term sprinkle off for the

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,710
obvious term sprinker that should be

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,830
opposite of the council alarm everything

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,759
is ok so what you have those example of

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,960
a validation system first of all in

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,400
mortgage or insurance type applications

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,139
then you have a monitoring type system

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,050
based alarm so let's get a look at

00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,599
deeper counts cash flow accounting

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,250
period so I told you this is going to be

00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:36,449
quick by the way so you're gonna have to

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:37,949
concentrate it's a lot to do what you're

00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,419
going to do is go debits and credits for

00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,090
an accounting period for a given account

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:43,470
these are all simple examples I'm going

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,630
to start with s curves that help you

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,659
understand how the engine actually works

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,520
so select star from account period so

00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:52,409
six staff of accounts cash blown account

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,380
period these are your tables these are

00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:56,820
the data we haven't joined with account

00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,139
number of the cash flow you with the

00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,909
account number of the accounts it's a

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,740
standard SQL everyone who should be

00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,539
understand this we're checking for when

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,300
this is credits and we've got a date

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:08,610
range to correlate the select to a given

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,320
quarter what we're doing here is we're

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,270
creating a view this is effectively a

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,130
view we're going to create view that

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,810
gives us the cash flow credits for that

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,969
quarter we then create a corresponding

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:22,949
view but the cash flow debits for that

00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:24,930
quarter as you know reviews rose

00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:28,050
materialized interview based upon the

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,030
data to the tables so if we have the

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,000
data these tables populated with these

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,430
fields like these rows of data these

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,459
views with two rows there and one row

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:41,490
that the two credits and one debit if we

00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:44,310
were to have triggers on the views each

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,160
row each materialized row is going to

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,389
execute this trigger

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,699
is just going to increase the balance

00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:51,009
this is going to decrease the balance

00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:52,230
you end up the balance minus 25 now

00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:54,339
actually you couldn't do this on a

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,199
database because databases have a

00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,509
problem called mutating tables become

00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:01,810
changed overdue for select run but it is

00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:04,449
imaginary well this would work so one to

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,389
rule you already seen the format you

00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:09,370
have rule name quotes optional if you

00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,899
don't have spaces gently quotes some

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,819
attributes which control the rule

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:14,560
execution behavior you have the left

00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,990
hand side which is the web when same

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,970
happens you have an then slide the right

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:26,800
hand side website happens then do this

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:28,540
then do these actions so there's the

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,629
left hand side where the person equals

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,790
mark there's the right hand side Prince

00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:36,610
hello mark what's the difference between

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:40,209
this and the rule methods must be called

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,910
directly you pass the Pacific isn't it

00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:47,649
it is imperative do this now do this now

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:50,079
with this data it is a command rules can

00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,300
never be called directly in a view you

00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,519
cannot put data into a group into a view

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,079
you can't say i want this data in this

00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,490
view just right you have to put it to

00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:02,290
the table in materializes into the into

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,050
the view this is that the same thing you

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:08,139
put take data into working memory and if

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,960
auntie realises into the view into the

00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:13,660
rule so rule is like a view

00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,490
count past Pacific instances because you

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,030
put it into the working memory and then

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:26,620
that is the to rise into the view so Rio

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:29,040
typical patterns a pattern is of the

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:34,660
type object type so you have tables in

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:37,030
SQL you have classes and java and rule

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,350
engines you have object type and this is

00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,180
a very simple one of the object type

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,770
which forms a pattern and this is made

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,420
of one or more filled constraints and

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,640
filtered strength consist of a field

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,530
name and a restriction values about this

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,510
is very very simple pattern that's a

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,340
foundation to this so now we're going to

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,830
take the simple SQL and we were

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,650
converted some rule everyone who now

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,740
understands how rule engine so databases

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,090
work have used work how the views

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,000
calculate cross products when you have

00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:06,070
the joins standard SQL theory should

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,350
help you understand rule engine so this

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,090
is doing the credits so this is saying

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,760
select star from accounting period

00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:16,150
select star from account the difference

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,210
is rule engines are a superset of SQL

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:22,810
they are more powerful SQL one of that

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:25,210
power comes from bindings 1880 see this

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,390
gives you if you were to select from

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:31,630
your row in your table and you can

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:34,150
create a variable which can point to a

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,040
column in that row that's what this is

00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:39,370
doing to say select star from account

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,910
period and ap- ility reference now then

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,800
it says select star from account and it

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,680
creates finally both on the whole

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,150
objects and from a field and it's a slip

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,190
star from a cash flow has a literal

00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,410
constraint type of credits there's our

00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,390
first joint so we're cash flow account

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,910
number equals see that says dollar

00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,140
account number so we got there that

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,410
condoms on his field that's like saying

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:05,260
where's Lex de zactly the saves this

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,150
there and the execution semantics are

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,380
exactly the same this grew up and

00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,900
there's our date range with data is

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,510
greater than 18 of start and Dex's S&A

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,530
p.m. this is the second same way of

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,530
doing those two things that

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:28,000
so here we have our credit raw not debit

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,790
all we have the data produces two roads

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,839
there one Rover in a rule engine we call

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:37,270
the materialized row we call an

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,300
activation so an activation is the rule

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:42,550
plus the matching data so here we have

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:46,080
two activations here we have one

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:49,480
activation those activations will fire

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,670
xvideos is consequences which increase

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,550
the balance decrease the balance balance

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,839
minus 25 or simple style you're going to

00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,240
show you few more patterns I'm not going

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:03,779
to go these in detail but this is

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,860
literal constraints variable constraints

00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:08,529
multi restrictions its multiple

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,810
restrictions on that this is just

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:12,910
combine the two it gets the more

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,010
complicated because you can start to the

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:18,010
expressions these are going to slides

00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,320
you can come back them later and it gets

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,550
fairly complex still believe it or not

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,920
this thing we're quite proud of because

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:27,310
if you were to use whether it's Jess or

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,440
whether it's clips I log no one has a

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,620
rule engine that is expressive as this

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,000
that can have all these ends applause

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,910
working with nest accessories maps and

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,380
raise for someone who worked with Java

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,700
JavaScript just like you out give it a

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,370
sort of time actually rule engines

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,990
they're still back in the 1990s one of

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,300
them's we're doing broad is dragging the

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,160
system signed up job developers and work

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,980
with it grieved voters can work with

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,450
sites doesn't feel like it's you know

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,450
built in Lisp like the other systems are

00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:00,170
very quickly what is a rule engine more

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,860
point of production rule system because

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,600
actually you can have a little

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,240
JavaScript engine in this invalidation

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,220
that's a rule engine so to classify we

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,410
are an expert system you have different

00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,010
types of expert systems we are on a

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,720
production rule expert system we were

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,519
actually work with becoming a hybrid one

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,170
vocal production rule system and

00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,240
backward chaining system product like

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,740
but that's our research you have a

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,839
production memory that's your rule if

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,410
your views you have your working memory

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,959
let's start your tables and you insert

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,370
update retract into your tables then

00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,519
there is a process which takes the

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:37,339
tables and rules and then combines them

00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,660
together to create the gender which in

00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:40,730
this trailer second that's basically how

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,540
a view would work it's materialized

00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:46,910
roads and do from the tables so table

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,329
table table object type object type

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,320
object type two views two rules now this

00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:53,089
is the bit that makes a little

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,329
difference if you were to be able to

00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:58,370
have one view that can aggregate all

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:01,699
your other views so amazing so this is a

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:04,220
list of all my views this is what this

00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:06,920
does basically says I've got two rows in

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,010
my credits rule I have two rows in my

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,380
edible two activations white activation

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,620
the agenda will have three activations

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:17,899
on a dawn on which they fire so I hear a

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,730
set this other Brittany to the fog

00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:21,980
attributes can control the execution

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,180
behavior and set the appt salience here

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:29,329
it's 50 settings as a foreman priority

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:34,010
default is 0 so all the default rules

00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:35,920
for credits and debits all of 0 they are

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,449
what's called him in conflicts and

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,579
because they are all the same level of

00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:44,209
priority they can be executed arbitrary

00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:46,670
rules are the more arbitrary you can get

00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:49,150
execution the better you do not want to

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,340
have imperative controls in your

00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,380
you want to try and limit that anyways

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,930
this one here we clearly can't print

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:59,590
balance until the calculations have done

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,960
so we have to give some controller so by

00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,400
big minus 50 we say do these three rules

00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,170
first don't care which all of those

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,970
three rules happen but as long as those

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,920
three balls happen together then you can

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,370
print balance so that's conflict

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,500
resolution with seniors very quickly to

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,150
get over the mutating tables issue we

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,160
have a two-phase system and ugly Gophers

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,650
too much but it means that in java lab

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,870
you you populate with tables you

00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,630
populate your object types insert one of

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,750
my retract builds up the agenda to build

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,940
up an agenda of all your possible

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,560
activations then a ghostly gender based

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,540
upon the conflict resolution strategy

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,760
which you just saw pops the first one

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,950
off and it goes into the consequence to

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,820
evaluate the consequence when it's back

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:44,050
in the consequence then right hand side

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,240
is back at the working memory action

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,760
phase so what instead what if I retract

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,980
so that means if I was to put some data

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,400
room and it created a hundred

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:57,040
activations and the first one was popped

00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,160
off the agenda it was evaluating I

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,420
changed some data the member that 99 is

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,089
other activations are no longer true

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:07,570
they ought to be taken off the agenda

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:09,610
and that's blast rule engine to go to

00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:12,310
mutation table issue and make sure that

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,270
no rule thighs that's not true so that

00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,250
means that just because something is

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,780
true and activate doesn't mean necessary

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,620
fires it has to be true when it attempts

00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,630
to fire okay to got yours flow this is

00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:27,700
another way of controlling execution

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:29,560
play by simply as a way of saying when a

00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,930
rule is allowed to fire so there's a

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,910
declarative format to give procedural

00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:37,050
control when rules run out to fire so

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:40,420
rules will say when this is true do this

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,490
it has no idea of where now we're order

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,970
so you can look at as rural castration

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,970
so we had a new attribute rule for a

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,120
group calculation that means that this

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:54,220
rule by true they still come fire until

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,090
the process engine gets to a point here

00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,250
and so the precedence

00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,980
there it can't find when it gets to

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,279
their allows it to fire so you known as

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,470
the rules to have control of the work

00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,820
for technical rules we have many more

00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,020
ways in which the rules of precedence

00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,919
racks just too much to do today so just

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,890
highlight in there there's a real prayer

00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:19,490
group here's a number guess example the

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:21,980
combines processes the rules and then

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,390
you can see side-by-side processes and

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,580
rules there because we actually down the

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,980
rules control processes as well and we

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:33,470
have all sorts of stuff I won't even get

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:35,720
that hammer time one of you say where we

00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,580
go with drools is we're not being a rule

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,440
and Jenny mall or prosenjit because

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,080
rules and processes and event processing

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,730
and semantics pathologies they do not

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,130
live on their own and each better

00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,600
obviously starts from a base and they

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,029
try and grow that and everything else is

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,440
quite weak so about three years ago we

00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,510
took the start and said now we're going

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,520
to have rules process reference to all

00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,500
this first class instance we need to

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,809
define a generic guidesmen to work

00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,779
together so that one hasn't does not

00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:04,159
receive a stronger than the other and we

00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:06,860
want to make sure that we can work at a

00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:09,679
range of modeling techniques so you have

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,899
a typical solar which is decision

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,880
services where your rule engine your

00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:15,350
essence you're completely couple and one

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,659
will call out the other typically the

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:22,760
rule engine is in a stateless format you

00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:24,140
so early on validation calculation this

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,909
is the simplest that's why service

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,230
against the service because people

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:29,929
couldn't get more complex more than

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,429
working that was me there isn't banning

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,240
the complex model it just means a system

00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:33,770
that mean good enough to make it

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,510
possible so the rules now to go right

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,130
back to the other end as well to work

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,289
with very tightly coupled rules and

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,270
processes and we allow you to work any

00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,860
end of the spectrum and this will be

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,020
called behavioral modeling it's about

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,399
taking application looking behavior and

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,070
mulling it we do not make you a

00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:50,570
process-oriented rules are intuitive you

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,029
use the software to solve a problem the

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,440
way in which you want to solve this we

00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:56,419
recognize that when you work with Rawls

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,460
press event processing they all follow

00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:00,649
the same life cycles you design you

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,690
simulate your test integrate your camera

00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:04,010
at you deployed exp you order you have

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,750
human task of directors management

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,190
humans are human intro

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,440
human target direction is not just a

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,820
process think it's also roasting so you

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,100
have to start thinking about things in a

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,980
different way at the moment because

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,540
became was the big baby emal tends to

00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,430
just shut going to be getting rules and

00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,740
article so you have to think differently

00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:25,190
to get a vest IT systems we have fully

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,750
integrated debugging an oddity what that

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,090
means is that when the rules when the

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,070
processes are executing we capture your

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,990
venting system everything else s mitts

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,820
events restart process when you're

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,080
entering note when you exit node when

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,840
you're in certain agents of working

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,000
memory when you fire a role in all of

00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,490
its events if you did collect all his

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,540
events you can create a correlated log

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:50,180
of causality causality means what cause

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,980
something to happen if I have this rule

00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,230
does something and it causes this

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,240
process to start in this process is

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,310
executing it cause these rules to fire

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,800
if your work with sarbanes-oxley if

00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,580
you're working with anything where

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,740
companies will have dedicated people

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,420
just just correlated reports and I have

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,580
some of these jobbies to do now so which

00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,720
one it says use our software you get

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,330
this out of the box you don't have you

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,500
can apply that guy he's gone we think

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,040
they can do something useful to be nicer

00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,650
so here you can see the rules things got

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,870
a little zoo there we go it's basically

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,610
saying the correlation as well so here

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,670
the rule is activated the row is

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,320
materialized here inspired and because

00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,450
it's part of raw flavor if the rule flow

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,430
group has to activate it order for the

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,810
rules of fires you start to see the

00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:35,360
correlation between the rules and

00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:37,850
processes one of the big things we

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,380
pushes domain pacific processes because

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,980
rules is all about the claritin moment

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:45,980
all about behavior modeling bpmn and the

00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,020
enigma 2 does not cut it one of our

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,850
errors are peripheries is the medical

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,730
team name we need to build processes

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,860
that have language semantics dialogues

00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,140
that be technician that these skilled

00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,990
person understands so that means the

00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,750
left hand side icons need to be icons

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,040
they know where they know the luck where

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,020
they drag that across the left the

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,930
dialog box has three things that they

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:12,840
know so drools makes a trivial to design

00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:16,540
the main pacific processes we do

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,760
maincity processes literally get up and

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,980
going 50 minutes to Mexican file you

00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,840
drop it in and just so this is the icon

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,510
this is a dialog box it just appears

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,310
eclipse it's prettier we have a number

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,650
of we call work lights and exit come

00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:32,590
withdrawals as examples so here we take

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:37,570
a series of Apache common stuff for

00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:40,270
automation so this will find files find

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,850
files on a disk there's a forage

00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:45,520
composite know each file if I'm to

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,200
unlock it run some rules to check that's

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,730
it might be checking dates or whatever

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,790
it needs to do to decide whether what

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:53,770
happens and then uses an archive one so

00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,960
the results of all this will go into the

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,640
archive we then copy it we email it the

00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,830
end and if you were to click on one of

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,680
these the associated dialog box would

00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,210
would pop up from that this is

00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,490
incredible to the scoop you developers

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,450
as well it keeps you a job it means that

00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,370
you're going to work with a business

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,930
analyst you going to say how would you

00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,400
like to capture your knowledge your

00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,980
business on how what is the codification

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,640
if your business on is your company what

00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,410
do you want your process is to say it's

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,430
really important so it means now you can

00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,950
work we give you the tools to work

00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,600
hand-in-hand to tailor your process

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,150
developed environment for another

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,410
stylist and then it means they go to

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,060
which down to working where they can

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,710
understand because you're just even be

00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,900
fair to and that were the solar level

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,840
and you're even gets you understand he

00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,630
comes with next but if you are a medical

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,190
technician you'll understand I need to

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,350
take a blood pressure and I need to go

00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,360
do some BP medication to notify the GPA

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,460
to be full up and you'll understand the

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,610
order and the orchestration leaves most

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,130
of these workflows are not complex the

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:55,720
not complex and the technicians can

00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,510
understand the procedure honest of these

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,270
but they can't start with gateways and

00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:03,370
splits and all these really complex

00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,990
stuff so they need icons that they are

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,910
trained upon they will tell developer

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,980
this is what I want my workflow to look

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,020
like this is what you need to develop so

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,879
I can get my job done and now i can do

00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,769
sign

00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:16,999
I can do it quicker I can get more

00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:19,319
efficiently I can someone is trained on

00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:21,629
we develop these domain specific

00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:23,069
processes allows you to create el

00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:25,399
methodologies which means when you have

00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:28,319
a new person on they don't have to learn

00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,909
vigman too they just learn the dimension

00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,769
work with a subclass it's incredibly

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,119
powerful tool and it's not something

00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:35,009
that anyone addresses in the market the

00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,829
moment and I say it's a big growth area

00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:39,269
to us that people should look uses the

00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:42,419
organization's do their own work pro

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:44,819
tools because they can't they can't use

00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:47,279
commercial ones cupcakes unders this

00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:49,379
flexible and when he brings on

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,089
yourselves it costs a lot of money so to

00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:52,319
have so it's generic there's powerful

00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:54,179
that comes with rules integration

00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,469
everything else we do the absolutely

00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,589
learner then we've got an announcement

00:24:55,469 --> 00:25:01,049
on october where the US Navy healthcare

00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:02,699
saw this and os des opportunist orders

00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:05,249
and they're just like we have to have

00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:07,919
this and they invested massively as the

00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:10,829
project allows us to hire ten people to

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,299
work on this side of things so it's

00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:14,609
incredibly important areas it back into

00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:16,879
the heart stopped I only wanted to touch

00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,879
on

00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:24,390
purchases so you saw not earlier on just

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,220
say when I have no red buses these are

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,929
called conditional elements you have the

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,840
pattern and the you hammers will know

00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:33,659
here is like a yeah we just couldn't

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,610
could just learn when there are no red

00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,809
buses in my sister my session my working

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:44,429
memory when there's one or more robust

00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:46,559
for all when all my bus is our red or

00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:48,210
when all my buses that have two floors

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,220
are ready so it's just gotta waste looks

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:54,350
and sets of data to make decisions based

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:58,740
on sets of data typically rule engines

00:25:54,350 --> 00:26:01,919
beam from their list lineage do not work

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,809
well with Java classes if you work with

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,820
jets you work with ilog if you work with

00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:07,950
this is what they do is they actually

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,049
have an internal representation it's

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:13,649
basically in this array and they will

00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:15,210
map your classes on to those and makes

00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:18,029
almost impossible to work with nested

00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:21,389
objects so you woken Jess we can work

00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:22,919
with the strings and you know numbers

00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:25,289
you can't start to work with more

00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,120
complex object graph to call them so

00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:28,679
drawers introduces thing called fraud

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,690
it's a probe it allows you to some

00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,570
patent is just a type of filter that's

00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:36,360
what it's doing is filtering the data

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,460
coming through it so that data doesn't

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,950
have to come from working memory it can

00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,870
come from anywhere so why can't just say

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:46,590
well I've got person working memory

00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:48,690
match in I've got a binding term and now

00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,100
I can actually filter the results of

00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,200
this expressions this is an ember

00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,610
expression we just evaluate and return

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,820
to collection we enter it's over that

00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,580
and results that collection it's ready

00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,990
through here it's a bit like a

00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:03,840
correlative sub-query you in Oracle

00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:06,299
Oracle you can t do joins with stuff is

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,639
not in your current database and it's

00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:10,559
like that's your team joins with stuff

00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:13,529
that's not in the working memory this

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,539
gets more powerful because whereas

00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:18,570
before we were joining with something

00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:20,519
that was in the working memory we can

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,920
have recalled global to global descents

00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,590
not

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,840
service members available here we have a

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,060
hybrid session this is just globally

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,340
available and it means that I have a zip

00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,410
code of my system I can't put all my

00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,480
people in my in my assistants too big I

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,950
can put the zip codes in so what I want

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,590
to do is go through the system zip code

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,270
by zip code and each zip code I'm going

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,800
to pull up people and process them

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:44,920
linking them that rule just that zip

00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:47,710
code so it's a hybrid named query sets

00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,690
the parameters set dollar zip code there

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,690
that's joined from their sets x x star

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,300
from zip code each road that comes back

00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,100
in the materialized interview it's

00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:01,000
they're going to do a correlated or a

00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,680
nested query against results this

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,510
hibernate sec we're here and we are

00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,800
going to go to all the people very very

00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:10,810
simple more powerful see so this is

00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,400
collected collects will collect

00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,380
everything they can find based on the

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,200
pattern you get it so here are st. coats

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,760
on my red buses it returns a list you

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,320
can then evaluate the size of that list

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,460
you have accumulates a cumulative

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,330
aggregation this is food pluggable we

00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:30,850
come out with some average total to turn

00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,380
to sing a song so we have number of

00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:35,260
these but these are fully pluggable so

00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,420
fedex are using this to do geospatial

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:42,340
analysis they have a system which you

00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:45,880
get on my demos where they called now

00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,950
basically it's it analyzes all of their

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,650
environments and use these aggregations

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,360
to work out their vehicles is there a

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,160
rate of climb of the vehicle too much

00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,110
sudden things very sensitive

00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,570
environments they can't go out too high

00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,790
is the temperature too hot so they use

00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,340
these our aggregations to continually

00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:05,200
summarize their bodies and they hook

00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,570
this into other subsystems do those

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,800
continues calculations and this is part

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:13,360
of drills fusion which i'll come on to

00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:15,370
in a minute so this is saying i have all

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,230
my get all my red buses get a reference

00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,810
to the takings and put it into this

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:22,060
function results as function is to rile

00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,600
you return it it's a number in this case

00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,730
doesn't have enough butt

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,990
number number is great and I do

00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,750
something so it allows me to look at

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:33,289
sector data perform calculations are

00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,789
those the this starts to take us into

00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:36,440
territory of functional programming is

00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:38,450
actually this from keywords now is

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,950
taking production or system and the

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,440
extended the functional programs allow

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,690
these conditional industry to be nested

00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,250
and chained so this is quite a complex

00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,650
example to show how we can combine

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:50,000
stuffers in the working memory along

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,190
with stuff that's from a hybrid aids

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,559
named query all aggregates by the

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,690
accumulation using more function

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,100
approach to programming I we're going to

00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:07,340
the diesels and ages three notes their

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:10,429
tireless so one of the things I've

00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,470
Baptist you don't want to go just where

00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,870
this is true do this that's not enough

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,970
sometimes when it is true do this but I

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:19,429
wanted to do it in every hour because

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:22,970
it's an alarm or I might wanted to do

00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:24,440
every month so it's just this content

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,809
called time as I draw every single

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,400
duration the duration was a safe way of

00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:31,580
saying it of delay the forest is saying

00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,950
when it's true wait 30 seconds before

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,480
actually doing it and if it stopped

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,929
being true before guess there's no

00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,539
seconds then stop what you're doing so

00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:44,840
what we're saying here is when the light

00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:47,299
is on after a minute 30 seconds turn the

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,309
light on so it's a timer that will turn

00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:53,240
the light off after a minute 30 seconds

00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:54,980
if the light is still we can then have

00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,010
interval based semantics just based on

00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,600
the JDK time you till so you have the

00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,950
initial delay and then the iterations

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,110
after that so this one is just the

00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,330
iteration after that since the

00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,710
equivalent of that it wants to have an

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,900
initial delay before the continual

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,030
iteration started so this basically have

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:15,169
a way to make a rule get seriously fine

00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:16,100
based on delays and iteration periods of

00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:17,659
course the next thing is they love it

00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,750
you do what can I just combine this with

00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:23,600
constituents so now i have my rules that

00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,880
when this rule is true based upon a

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,030
given krong definition here Todd you

00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,280
like all this stuff based upon the

00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:34,280
chrome definition here is ever know what

00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,490
Chronos here as a conscious way of

00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,830
defining

00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:40,200
scheduling and it's going to be complex

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,090
very difficult very powerful so you can

00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,740
now include crumbs it means that where

00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:47,940
this rule is true based on this chrome

00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,559
definition of fart regular intervals we

00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,330
can combine asperger calendar is not

00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,220
going to do mon-sun 25 regular sports we

00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,440
need to go to save wet if you fire so

00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,570
just be like an alarm I want to learn to

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,400
fire every hour and really has any true

00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,650
weekdays this is like long as the rule

00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,300
engine on to produce engines do pioneer

00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:07,940
there so this allowed to say that i'm

00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,440
only at weekdays and this color is a

00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,510
protocol based on coors canada so you

00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,950
give a course calendar to drools no

00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,220
point to fire any kind of stuff is

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:19,980
pretty impressive based on weekdays this

00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,450
will fire every app because mood days

00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,580
we've got high priority that i can have

00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:25,470
an opposite rule that's mutually

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,420
exclusive it's mutually scriptures to

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:29,220
the calendars now weekends you can have

00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,660
a different priority there so now the

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,070
info basis for hours so you have two

00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,960
rules of mission suits and based on

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,250
account of the definitions that you can

00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,679
use the standard courts ones we can

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,540
define your own so now you have timers

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,920
both instable and chrome based and

00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,720
calendar or within your rule engine

00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,630
because because every process engine

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,070
foot integrated that means that based

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,110
upon the calendar is changing you can

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:52,380
start processes you can check and then

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:54,929
wait states and then unlike the typical

00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,330
systems which are process orientated not

00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:58,920
only you saying do this the weekend

00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,750
you're giving a conditional information

00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,960
when to do it as well so it creates a

00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:05,550
much more powerful garment module is it

00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:11,140
always brain hurting i said this would

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:14,140
be intense how we doing okay

00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,580
should just make it we're going to

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,690
launch it up a little now I'm going to

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,500
try and teach a bit more about royal

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:23,430
design so ever sing called truth

00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,600
maintenance TMS and in furrows

00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:27,280
inferences a scary word you have

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,320
companies like cortical and go around

00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,540
saying you don't need the furnaces to

00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,610
scare is useless because it's all don't

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,070
good and they try and use really

00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,260
complicated examples to show why burn

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,450
too sunny don't need actually ferret is

00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,130
very simple it's very very useful and if

00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,350
you can explain the right becomes quite

00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,360
obvious it's not scary word anymore so

00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,390
let's go through example about issuing

00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,520
bus passes so children have bus passes

00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:54,220
and allison bakke parties so what we're

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:58,840
saying here is that when I'm a person

00:33:54,220 --> 00:34:01,480
whose ages on 16 created child must pass

00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:05,050
for them whenever person who is 16 or

00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,940
older Kim adult bus pass this couples

00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:10,090
the logic because imagine i've got a

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,260
company and becoming splitting to you

00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:16,179
have one department which chooses the

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,940
policy who is a child who's not child

00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:22,690
you have another department which issues

00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:24,550
the bus passes the people that issue the

00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:26,470
bus pass don't necessarily care when

00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,570
that person is 15 or 16 they're just

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:31,210
told issue bus sponsors for children

00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:32,230
issue bus process for adults so the the

00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,610
decision-making is two different

00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,679
apartments and what I've done here is

00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:39,149
that the the department which issue the

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,919
bus passes and now tightly coupled

00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:44,050
decision-making of whether it's 16 or

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:45,880
over but only is it's had a couple it

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,230
means they are exposed it is leaking

00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,870
information to the relations not have to

00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:51,130
care about and it makes the change

00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,669
process complex because it means the

00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:58,780
department decide the policy to say 16

00:34:54,669 --> 00:35:01,450
or 16 and under they have to issue

00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,530
change requests then go to the other

00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,660
department then have to apply this

00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:07,000
change of question it's very brittle

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:09,840
process to pass the knowledge through

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,520
your company changing policy decisions

00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,820
what happens when a child stops being 16

00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,820
as well

00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:21,230
so it's monolithic because actually I've

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,640
been in a decision table because he's

00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,819
bringing all your logic into one place

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,040
it is leaking because it means that one

00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:29,599
person who's making a decision is seeing

00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,839
information they should not need to care

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:37,040
about it is brittle because weapons in

00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:40,700
the person stops being 16 so how'd it go

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,099
over this so truth makes this has been

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,500
called on large concessions logical

00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:47,599
insertion is a way of saying not only

00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,609
how going to put some into the working

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,250
memory not am I going to create

00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:55,430
something put it in its lifetime will

00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:57,400
depend upon a condition only while that

00:35:55,430 --> 00:36:01,339
condition is true will exist so only

00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,750
while this person is less than 16 what

00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:06,380
we have this thing called is child's

00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:08,990
this child is what cool it inference it

00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:11,089
is a fact that represents the results of

00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:13,400
a decision it is a fact that represents

00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:15,950
this person is under 16 it means we have

00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:20,000
an object which in capillaries some

00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:22,069
decision-making process in both the

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,869
weather gives us matic intense it's a

00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:25,549
child and a way that gives it

00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:28,250
capsulation because you don't know to

00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:30,530
Charlie Wright Patterson what makes it

00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,150
we just know this person to child so it

00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:35,329
gives an encapsulation because it

00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:37,819
decoupling and logically syrtis means

00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:40,220
that this inference we made that this

00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:42,349
person is a child what only exist while

00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:45,260
the persons under 16 as soon as that

00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:47,089
person stopped being a 616 that fact is

00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,280
automatically deleted removed from the

00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:52,160
system and then we have a rule that

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,099
mutually exclusive otherwise get the

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,890
whip that said when the persons over 16

00:36:55,099 --> 00:37:02,089
we logically sir he is Nana so we create

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:04,040
an object which encapsulate a decision

00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:05,990
that creates and ferns and amused

00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,910
logical sessions maintain the truth of

00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,410
that so this thing that we've referred

00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:12,559
this bit of information to be discovered

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:16,430
inside of them we always know true based

00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:19,480
upon some other logic so now that means

00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:21,799
we have one department that's saying

00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,240
when some is a child when someone's now

00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:24,660
that that's their responsibility and

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,000
they publish these rules

00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,470
creates these appearances we have

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,869
another Department who's responsible for

00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:33,390
issuing bus concerts now this looks much

00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:36,660
better they say when a person is a child

00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,849
given a bus pass so he got decoupling

00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,619
we've got encapsulation remove of

00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:43,380
brittleness we've moved the leakiness

00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:45,180
much nicer and same here where the

00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:49,410
person is an adult it should an adult

00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:53,460
bus pass we can combine is further

00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:55,829
because when we give the child bus pass

00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:59,609
we want to have a request to had it back

00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:03,180
obviously so now we can say when there

00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:05,609
is no bus pass child bus passes so when

00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,460
there is no longer a child bus parts for

00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:10,500
this person is your request so this all

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,460
happens automatically so you logically

00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:19,319
sir and child bus pass that child bus

00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:23,130
pass is based upon the inference we made

00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:26,010
by the department is less than 16 when a

00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:28,079
person becomes 16 the inference is

00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,740
automatically retracted because they

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,510
have Affairs automatic attracted we also

00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,940
the child bus is automatic attractive

00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:38,910
that means these appearances the chain

00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,010
and truth cascades and if that truth

00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:43,079
breaks at any point everything blur

00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,670
point is automatically cascaded up so I

00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,200
notice a little bit complicated I hope

00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,510
you just get a bit of it that's great

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:53,309
you all done very well we're almost

00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:54,599
there so anyway this is basic same when

00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:56,880
the lodge is cascaded back to the

00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:59,039
specific points issue a Request it's all

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,020
done automatically by the system so

00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,880
truth maintenance & ferns gives you

00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,770
decoupling of knowledge responsibilities

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,089
in caps mitchell knowledge provides

00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,369
semantic obstructions where's

00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:10,589
encapsulation because if a person is

00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:12,420
breaks to 60 in less than 60 what does

00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:13,590
that mean I don't know that mean just

00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,910
just something

00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:18,260
it means different things to different

00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:20,160
people you know if it was aging a sense

00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:23,220
that's different in different countries

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,780
so it allows you to capsular to give its

00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,520
semantic meetings it's quite important

00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,560
makes things really what makes them more

00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,050
maintainable and the truth basins as

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,400
well helps add integrity robustus so I

00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:37,220
think that's just a little smattering of

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,510
a Rubik's theory ok this is last bit is

00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:42,420
about our drills fusions of drills

00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,710
fusion extends our existing rule

00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,970
language with a vet processing

00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,720
capabilities or complex event processing

00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:50,820
capabilities there are number of

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,790
different engines that have evolved for

00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,860
this called query-based engines so

00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:58,440
query-based engine typically based on

00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,840
SQL and they just extreme of data and

00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,360
they look for changes that stream of

00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,270
data and they use and design practical

00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,130
event condition action basically means

00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:11,550
they're going to you submit an event

00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:13,950
based bomb site they found for me is

00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,720
actually quite limited and I do another

00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:17,360
talk but had more time I start to show

00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,780
comparisons withdrawals and esper

00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,250
because I only read us around to

00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,330
different languages to do the same thing

00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:28,920
one language is a very subset the other

00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:31,170
these query based systems do not support

00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,630
side effects I wagons of information

00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,580
your query changes what engines do they

00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,450
don't have all the powerful features

00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,310
that were interested like truth

00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,630
maintenance and not only that you have

00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,040
to learn the two different API you have

00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,100
to learn two ways of building it it

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,480
means that you got to learn everything

00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,190
two or three times to be got if you were

00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,530
to use a process engine rule engine and

00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,060
invent presenting one terror you have to

00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,680
learn the API for each you get to learn

00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,170
a language breach you're going to have

00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,270
to learn the annoyances of each one and

00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:59,160
as you know you can learn one thing

00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:00,420
quite efficiently when you get the next

00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,490
one you may be the same at what you can

00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,110
less efficient I think it's a third less

00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,820
efficient again so you guys are spent a

00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:07,050
week learning how to read you the same

00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,270
thing how to build something how to

00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:11,370
deploy something how to debug something

00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:13,770
how to check errors all these three

00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:15,210
different systems and as you get older

00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,740
you get to put here in your 20s you

00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,870
don't mind doing it when you get your

00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,150
30s you get

00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:22,070
you like I don't want to deal with this

00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,900
I just want to do my job it's not

00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,760
interesting it's not fun anymore it's

00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,320
like there when I was 24 we can store a

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,010
different linux distribution anyway now

00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:34,010
I hate this about two windows Oh red I

00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,870
don't use Windows I am usually times

00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:41,570
this isn't this is not a Windows desktop

00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:44,810
hell so anyway haven't much time drools

00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:47,750
uses a full row based approach to combat

00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,280
event processing tibco do as well many

00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,720
of the members for query-based no more

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,020
limits assistant put a lot of fathers

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,180
say why you need this special system

00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:59,420
need a special system can do this cover

00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:02,080
like a pagar Esper many of them try to

00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,670
put that raw edges this or just bollocks

00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,950
it's simply because the existing wall

00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:09,200
engines have not been designed yet to do

00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,790
that does not mean they can't do it so

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,680
your suggest you started trying to

00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:15,110
compare to impress on Jess of course

00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,760
it's going to blow is only it's not just

00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,170
can't do this it just has to be extended

00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,180
yet for and there's no reason why these

00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,800
systems can't be extended so we've taken

00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:25,040
many of the things that's needed to

00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:30,410
address combat spent processing it made

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:32,060
it possible rule engine okay so first of

00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,010
all of your engine has a single point of

00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,240
insertion which creates a bottleneck so

00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,370
you've got ten different cues that

00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,160
streams of data coming in what you don't

00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:42,350
want to do is to have to keep have more

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,420
going through one point of fun and the

00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,980
other problem they'll say is that if you

00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,750
go to work your memory it sees

00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,620
everything and if everything has to be

00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,610
evaluated me quite slow and cumbersome

00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,620
so you're creating these things called

00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:56,800
entry points and engine point is a way

00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:59,540
to partition the knowledge base and

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,670
these are names typically for each

00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,680
stream of data you have will become an

00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,020
entry points so here we have the whole

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,510
broker stream like when you kept it up

00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,550
to JMS or so HTTP whatever you want and

00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,960
I have a little producer-consumer which

00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,450
would have to be inserted into this

00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,420
named entry point so that's on the API

00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:20,240
side on the language side we can now

00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,380
have a pacsun from and entry points so

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,960
what means that this

00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,730
here doesn't filter everything's been

00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,640
working on me any filter sucks on this

00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:31,730
stream learning that because of range

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,350
rules worked naturally these streams

00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,090
obviously these our entry points can be

00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:37,760
correlated with other entry points and

00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,620
we try and make sure that each entry

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,420
point doesn't much its own thread as

00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,800
possible so what that means is each

00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,350
entry point to automatically on its own

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,060
thread and we will take care of the

00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,890
synchronization in Georgia two threads

00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,380
we try and do as much in its own thread

00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:54,200
skating the efficiency of throughput so

00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:56,210
that takes care of that rule engines do

00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,540
not have temporal comparators spray

00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:02,180
didn't do comparisons in time draws of

00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:05,990
Nags stone above all 13 temporal

00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:08,780
operators as I make a collage in model

00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:12,260
any type of time and you can do this by

00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:15,110
saying this comparator and don't

00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:16,820
compares have different arguments

00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,320
because you can stay on the same after

00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,870
this gets I'll just between one second

00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,100
and ten seconds so this is saying when I

00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:25,130
have a buyer acknowledgement event

00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:28,430
there's between one 71 seconds and 10

00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:32,330
seconds after a buy order events how can

00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:35,420
stand visually a before be a me to be

00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:38,300
able at be a pinch be shows the visual

00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:41,330
content of that we support all 13 of

00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:44,630
those just means you basically you

00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:46,370
express everything at the time it's not

00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:48,560
just important to know where time

00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:50,360
happens when something happens it's

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,880
often more important of a site does not

00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,560
happen so what does that mean if I have

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,810
a buy order of it what I want to know

00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,760
it's really important is when the buyer

00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:01,490
moment does not happen so when I say

00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,840
here it will have a buy order event when

00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,570
it does not happen between 1 and 10

00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:07,610
seconds at my apartment event that I

00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,410
need to do something and I notice again

00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,990
we now have effective three different

00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:14,900
our areas with a working memory and my

00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:16,760
magic default entry point have my home

00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,590
breaker stream that have Mike stock

00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,910
trader street its core eight in all

00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,100
three of these checking for absences

00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:25,220
events how much courage do you have to

00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:27,410
write to do this an orange kid hello and

00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:30,940
you have to maintain it I showed this to

00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:33,250
deutsche bank they banks all about time

00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,750
everything do is about time and they

00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:37,750
write this complex systems to analyze

00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:39,190
the change of the stops at a time the

00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,550
aggregations in time and then out to try

00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:44,740
and test all this when you have theta

00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:47,530
and rules that i'm working the time is

00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:50,140
incredibly brutal incredibly bristles

00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:51,970
very hard when you take someone who

00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,680
spends day in day out dealing with

00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,480
websites enema timers and

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,609
synchronization all the low-level code

00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,220
to try and make this example and you

00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:04,780
show them this they thought instantly

00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:07,270
loved so enjoyed your bank is like a

00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,069
revelation when they saw this but it

00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:13,180
gets even better so we can take these

00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:14,710
patterns and we can create Windows we

00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:17,050
can say where this patent happens in a

00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,670
period of time so we can say when this

00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:20,859
patent happen it happens every time with

00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,050
those of five seconds or we can get the

00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:24,390
counts when the stock ticker happens

00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:27,700
over a length of a thousand tickets

00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:29,829
because what we do is orthogonal you

00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,420
learn more languages and then a few key

00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:34,030
words to extend their own language

00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:35,440
prevent processing capabilities so that

00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,670
means you already know the cumulant

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,869
you've already learned from and running

00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,940
that will your pattern language when you

00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:41,380
learn the rules you don't have to go

00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:45,640
away I've learn a whole new thing for

00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:47,440
the CP is just an over keyword the 13

00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,240
operators you've already learn and I

00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,010
said now you've got full CD capabilities

00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,849
with your existing knowledge so allow

00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:56,589
you to do more by learning less think

00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:59,500
about it you do more learning let's it's

00:46:56,589 --> 00:47:01,450
great this is going to reduce the

00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,160
average stock price at a retirement in

00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,630
five seconds if you haven't stopped

00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,460
right at a time when 25 seconds it's

00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,530
more than hundred than do something as I

00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,650
said these these functions are fully

00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:12,410
pluggable is a

00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,180
is a jar interface you register that and

00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,670
you can do anything you want man Emily

00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:19,760
will work with any subsystem you like it

00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:22,750
does sir tisk analysis to try and show a

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:31,099
little bit how this works with processes

00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:32,480
we very much when you start to have

00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:35,000
something that has built-in event

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,920
communities you want to start designing

00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,470
for vendor in architecture what does

00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,789
that mean it means you want to make sure

00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:43,309
that everything in your system it's

00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:45,020
deven do everything with events

00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:46,130
everything that happens whether someone

00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:48,079
needs to consume I'm not doing events

00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,819
every state change a mitten event so

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,440
within the rule engine every time we're

00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:53,240
working every time we insert something

00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,279
every time to start process and time

00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,809
little fires from in today if this was a

00:47:55,279 --> 00:47:58,789
business application you can catch the

00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:01,069
events to you know someone who's fired

00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:04,099
someone is hired it's done in by a stock

00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:05,599
all these are events and you if you can

00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:07,130
model everything that happens every

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,740
state change that happens in your system

00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:12,680
you just admit these allow you to create

00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:15,440
systems which are far less brittle large

00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,430
crate system which allows you to do

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,260
things with them which you might not

00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,750
necessarily attendance you design system

00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:22,010
in a good event bottle up front and then

00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,029
use trying to build difficult

00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:25,160
correlation so here do you think about

00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:26,390
process what is the process a process is

00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,220
just correlation as sequential

00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:30,140
correlation of events as it goes from

00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:32,930
know to know to know to know it is just

00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:35,630
an event has a state change and

00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:36,829
entitlement so you can omit eventually

00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,619
it means the complex event processing

00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:41,359
side can suck with a sin and it can

00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:43,839
analyze this so just very very simple

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:47,599
one here I have a process started events

00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:49,730
so have an order process and in stating

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,170
that on every time an order process

00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,599
start this event will be made

00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:57,829
automatically by the system and I say

00:48:53,599 --> 00:49:00,529
overtime win over one hour due account

00:48:57,829 --> 00:49:02,690
aggregation if over a period of an hour

00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:06,410
there's a process is started more than a

00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:09,319
thousand times then do something one of

00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,870
the things that we're systems are going

00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:14,400
and pretty much at the own ass

00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:18,310
finding is necessary in systems are

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,740
moving more to call dynamic and adaptive

00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:23,230
so dynamic means the systems can change

00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,700
on the fly that means rude edges have

00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:27,130
always been done if you can add rules

00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:29,770
you can removals and a safe assist face

00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:31,840
the staple system while they're running

00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:34,210
you don't have to take it down you don't

00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,760
have to put it back up again there's a

00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:39,430
saver processes in our system and rules

00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,870
you can add processes debris prometi the

00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,880
knowledge bases in two composite

00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:45,250
knowledge you can change any part of

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,770
these the learning that our prisoners

00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,750
relay to change sub parts of that we

00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:52,600
call this dynamic fragments

00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:54,460
orchestration so this is about the done

00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,010
outside now if you can have some this

00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,390
monitoring itself you get centered

00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,470
active because it can monitor what's

00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:01,780
doing and then it can change yourself

00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:05,350
start gets a most dynamic and adaptive

00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:07,180
systems of the future will be that it

00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:10,830
will be both blixt are dynamic and they

00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:10,830
will be adapted that we self-monitoring

00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,850
questions I gave us must be patience it

00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,090
never has a headache tonight very very

00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:21,850
sorry I says they have a lot to go

00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:23,950
through and so there's so much more it

00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:25,990
takes about 3-4 hours to do this justice

00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,970
I hope you understand small amounts a

00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:31,530
bit and I hope people learn something

00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:31,530
today questions

00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,950
