Title: Moonlight and you
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2010
Description: 
	By Andreia Gaita

Moonlight is an open source implementation of Microsoft Silverlight for Unix systems, developed by Novell. It not only allows existing Silverlight applications to run on Linux, you can also create your own on Linux and MacOS using the MonoDevelop IDE.

In this hands-on presentation we'll take a look at what Moonlight provides now, what it can do for developers, what tools are there, and how you can have a lot of fun with it.


FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software. More info at http://fosdem.org

I hope this works so welcome to the

00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:23,680
moonlight talk let me just find my stuff

00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:26,529
hopefully mmm this is good okay um hi

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,680
real late but hopefully I won't take too

00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:31,689
much of your time I'm not going to do

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,110
that many slides I have four slides

00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:37,870
because I want to do a hands-on that

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,750
most presentation we haven't done one of

00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:45,040
those four of moonlight for a while ever

00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:47,170
I think so you further out moonlights

00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,330
all day long silverlight in mumbai so

00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,790
i'm not going to tell you what it is i'm

00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:55,030
going to show you what it is the talk is

00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:59,589
entitled moonlight and you because it's

00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:02,530
i want to show what what you need to

00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:05,110
work with moonlight you the user with

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:10,000
you the developer what tools we have

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:13,469
right now to build applications what

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,799
works what doesn't what features I've

00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:19,780
ever are available and to basically i'm

00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,880
going to show you what I had to do to

00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,990
get the demos working today so you can

00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,880
do the same with your application

00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,719
basically so you know what when light is

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,179
open source implementation of

00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:35,469
silverlight this is the goals there are

00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:41,469
stated on the site there's still the

00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:43,840
same i find the third one the fifth one

00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:47,770
is funny but the third one is the one I

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:52,240
like best because some one thing that we

00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:54,819
had from day one was pretty much support

00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,579
for desktop applications because when we

00:01:54,819 --> 00:02:02,979
did moonlight it was just a quick step

00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,270
to run it on on the desktop because we

00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:07,929
don't actually need the browser for

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,880
anything it's gtk back end the browser

00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:12,700
is there to provide us a window and and

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,660
events but we can do that too so it's

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:20,320
it's not that complicated so usually

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:22,830
the good part about that is that most

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,750
applications that work on silverlight

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,240
the co can be just compiled for the

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,160
desktop and run on the desktop with no

00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,160
changes are very few changes basically

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,040
and the more the more you go into

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,900
Silverlight versions the less dependent

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,150
the less problems you have because the

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,180
last year depending on JavaScript and

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,940
web technologies originally moonlight

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:50,070
one point L was completely JavaScript

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:53,620
and a run time no c sharp know anything

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,500
but as we plugged in the good parts

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,260
which is the c-sharp the runtime and

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:03,400
everything you cut down on the web

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,140
technologies a bit so it's easy to do

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,960
the translation between one and the

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:12,210
other so I like that goal I like the

00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,210
other ones too that one's my favorite um

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:20,890
this is this is how Silverlight to move

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:24,550
my works okay there's a lot of layers a

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,880
lot of structure a lot of everything but

00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,430
this is what happens the runtime is

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,590
sitting in the middle ok it's C++ you

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,840
don't see it it's there you know you're

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,810
doing stuff you as an application

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,230
developer you as the user of the api's

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:45,459
you're doing stuff in c-sharp right

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:49,209
which is talking to C++ via a lot of a

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:51,850
lot of calls you're you're running on

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,650
the browser there's two way

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:58,030
communication between all these layers

00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,070
basically so when you load the plug in

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,700
the browser loads the plug and

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,800
initialize the C++ eventually ends up in

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,630
C sharp wits ends up in C++ it back

00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,600
again tells you something in JavaScript

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:13,330
and then you can do calls from one end

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:18,430
to the other and it's transparent for

00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:21,549
you so this is basically what you care

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,800
about are the two endpoints and like the

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:26,870
middle is what we care about we

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:33,229
hopefully care about it off so it crash

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:40,280
anything that's our business so I'm

00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:47,780
going to start off with demos ah kill

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:49,340
this thing okay so i don't know if all

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:54,110
of you are here for the monodevelop talk

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:56,720
this is gonna develop I'm running it

00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:01,900
locally it's the latest build but it's

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,900
it's the same thing that's released

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,240
before we had moonlights integration on

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,310
monodevelop we had to do everything on

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,810
the command line I'll show you how to do

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,160
that in a bit because there are

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,860
important tools on the command line that

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,229
you will need to know because we don't

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,330
have designers and GUI tools for

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:26,110
everything but we do have now

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:28,970
integration on what develop so basically

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,220
because that's what I do on when I

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:36,590
develop its am on a moonlight

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:38,360
application project so I don't know if

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:42,400
this is expected already on the latest

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,400
version of where is Luis

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:52,259
it's not it's not on yet by default

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,259
moonlight type projects on monodevelop

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,000
right right right right because we're at

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,160
well yeah well anyway we're talking

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,930
about leading edge basically because you

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,030
in like this the trees just coming out

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:07,600
and we're just starting to have all

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,970
these tools available so what do you

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:15,160
want basically let's just go quickly

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:19,810
through a little tiny small sample hello

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:26,789
world usually this is it has a purpose

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,789
believe so um just change this

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,780
okay for those ways if you well you

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,850
probably haven't used visual studio

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:46,760
interview but this is pretty close

00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,650
basically this is the hello world that

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,290
Michael had sus and I think the template

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:56,020
original still there there sorry hello

00:06:51,290 --> 00:07:00,080
moon not hello world this is your basic

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:05,870
zamel description of a moonlight

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:08,360
application it's just totally empty if

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:11,660
we are talking about doing moonlight

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,060
applications like this you don't have to

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,250
even leave want to develop to run and

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,650
debug because it's all integrated right

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,430
now which is basically when i'm going to

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,690
show you so we are debugging right now

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:28,430
and one light application doesn't do

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:33,520
anything but if I step in you can see

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:36,110
that it's jumped into this page which is

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,419
initialization that's separate this is a

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:45,010
basic basic template of a mummification

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:47,120
so this is the entry point monodevelop

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,979
moonlights as soon as we release

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,410
everything and all the districts have it

00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:53,540
that's what you're going to get

00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,430
debugging applications hopefully we'll

00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,990
get a designer really really nice and

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:02,870
really really soon so you don't even

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:06,710
have to have zamel written down but this

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:09,710
stuff is starting to work so this is it

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,860
generated the that's the back of the

00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,770
generated file from what civil like

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,560
moonlight does is it takes your example

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:22,520
description file and generates also

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,830
generate all the hook-up codes so you

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,780
don't have to basically which is just

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,169
basically hooking up all the objects

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:35,810
that are described on zelma so there's a

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:38,419
grid layout route which means layout

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,959
route is going to be hooked up here so

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,680
you can

00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:47,560
access it later so this is a hello world

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,750
this is by the way you can't see it

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,690
because the screen is too small but we

00:08:49,750 --> 00:09:00,100
going to see it in a second this is

00:08:52,690 --> 00:09:04,860
running as soon as it shows on firefox

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:08,440
3.6 ok so when without launched firefox

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,019
connected the debugger which is it's a

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,470
synchronous and then so we you're

00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:19,029
debugging a plug-in inside firefox on

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:22,500
monodevelop visually which is a good

00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:25,930
step forward i think it's a good one so

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,779
Miguel was complaining earlier that we

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:32,440
don't have chrome supports we do have

00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:36,850
firefox supports up to 3.7 I think it's

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:43,709
working fully we do have chrome supports

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:43,709
and just because he was complaining

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:56,760
sorry just because he was complaining

00:09:48,910 --> 00:10:03,149
i'm going to quickly work i'm going to

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:03,149
fake it basically and while I do this

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,750
okay well this is running here we are

00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,089
not going to see it you're going to see

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:22,210
it's in a bit i'm typing but you're

00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:28,910
going to see it this scene is this goes

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:31,250
yes now you're gonna see it okay so

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:41,029
while i'm building a separate branch

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:43,070
just for chrome come on sorry so what

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:46,070
happens is with the chrome support the

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,750
chrome is a bug okay chrome has this

00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,320
nice feature of running plugins out the

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,910
process so they don't interfere with the

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,040
browser basically if they blow up the

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,339
browser doesn't blow up so it just so

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,110
happens that you can do a pull plug in

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:02,900
with one line code that freezes the

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:06,140
browser and that one line code happens

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:10,330
to be in moonlight so it freezes so it

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:15,230
does work it's just kind of doesn't so

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:17,360
just moves that line to another place

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,450
that doesn't freeze chrome it just so

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,529
happens that Firefox doesn't work which

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:26,990
is run so we other have one or the other

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:29,300
you can't have both for now I'm working

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,870
on it it's hopefully it's going to be

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:36,920
fixed very soon so anyway for now chrome

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,630
support is its full except for video so

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,610
we don't have video because video

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:47,660
requires a back end that we need to do

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,850
Firefox has quirks that we support that

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:53,180
then obviously a Firefox bridge for

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,920
video doesn't work on Chrome so we need

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,709
to do that but everything else basically

00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,270
basically works on Chrome which is what

00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:01,540
i'm going to show you in a bit as soon

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,540
as this

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:15,620
okay so this is this is a little script

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,080
that to set up a bunch of LD library

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,670
path path and see include button

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,880
whatever that's sitting on my home this

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:25,490
is really useful because if you don't

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,790
want to blow up your environment it's

00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:32,600
kind of handy because moonlight runs on

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,130
a to the 2.6 branch of 10 not trunk so

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,230
if you want to start playing around with

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,930
it then you have motor soul sista many

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,930
then you have to have separate mono

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:44,030
you're going to blow up your system so

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,800
i'm going to put this on when we have

00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,290
the slides on the web i'm going to put

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,390
the script on the somewhere so if you

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:53,860
want to play with it you can just pull

00:12:50,390 --> 00:13:00,020
it and not blow up your system so we

00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:02,780
were showing a hello world so this is

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:06,950
what I'm gonna develop created right the

00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:10,820
the tues amell's to fee s1 of develop

00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:14,480
dumps everything on the bin directory so

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:19,190
I'm going to go there this is what it

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,990
runs the HTML page I can actually do

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,470
this because it's just a simple page

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,900
that Firefox cannot work this is the

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:31,430
same thing that no result does right

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:33,820
just to prove just to prove the chrome

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,820
works

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,800
chrome works oops you can't see it sorry

00:13:43,010 --> 00:14:04,740
female chrome okay now let's just switch

00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:11,790
branches again yes it's not going to be

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:13,980
very ok so now well that's doing that so

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:17,160
we were looking at the application on

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,440
one develop right there's tools on

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,590
command line to do the same thing that

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,850
might have developed us basically so we

00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:29,010
have this hello world and what Mona's

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:33,030
Alex essentially does is one ends up

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:36,980
ends up is a front end it basically

00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:40,170
drives the compiler and the resource

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,940
packer and everything to create a zip

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,820
file which is basically a zip file also

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,860
the HTML and impacts average resources

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,280
in the assemblies so it's the front end

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:56,370
to to build new light applications

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:59,280
basically so if i run ends up here it's

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:02,330
smart and it knows that everything exam

00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,700
loan dumbots es is going to be compiled

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:08,010
anything any they'll else that are yours

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,080
and that you reference basically are

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,660
going to be included everything that's

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,510
in there is going to be included so and

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,510
it's cute it creates the dll's and

00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:22,470
everything it's messy not one develop is

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:24,510
cleaner and it creates say HTML page

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,240
somewhere around here which is usually

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:32,940
the same name is the directory where you

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:38,690
want so this guy's then so basically

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,690
it's the same thing you just run

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:51,790
still in the same place our hello world

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:56,830
now the trick is for desktop apps it's

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:58,990
very complicated you do desk desktop and

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:02,140
then you have another tool called em

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:04,510
open which does the same thing a Firefox

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,940
which is basically a curated ctk window

00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,480
and then initialize the mono runtime and

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,630
moonlight and everything and basically

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:16,570
do the window so what you do here is

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:19,000
called the boot up file not the HTML

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,890
file obviously because the zip file

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,840
contains everything that the application

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:31,150
has and then and then you have a teacher

00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:36,700
k window okay that is running exactly

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:43,390
the same code as firefox if you don't

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:45,610
want window decorations Vashti will give

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,380
you what we call desk let that we

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:53,920
haven't touched in a really really long

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:57,790
while which is basically yeah fix it

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,650
that for any morning it's the work so

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,350
basically window with no the questions

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:06,640
which allows you to now do something

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:10,380
cute like we're going to go somewhere

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,380
else because I love opening windows

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:18,570
there are some very old samples of desk

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:23,640
let's like three years old maybe

00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:23,640
something like that this will

00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:38,629
who think this one is great let's uh I

00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:41,480
wanna know why the launcher has some

00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:43,249
problem or something this is old code

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,609
that needs to be reviewed there's some

00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:48,649
problems with the the gtk side this code

00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:51,350
hasn't been touched in what two or three

00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:55,639
years maybe so we need to review it

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:58,190
basically but this is a really really

00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:59,809
simple clock application that has no car

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,440
basically it's just all description and

00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:06,159
animation we can look at the code very

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,950
quickly but it's running on desktop and

00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:12,590
it's totally transparent and needs

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,299
fixing in the drawing there and there's

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,700
no window decoration because its run

00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:26,840
with dash D so you can basically do oh

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:29,809
no applets right just so just show you

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,269
the difference that's that's what dash D

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:35,059
does right this is your original the

00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:38,379
transparency code has a few bucks so

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:41,570
this is a moonlight desktop app which

00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:44,480
could technically be compiled to run on

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:47,119
on the browser it there is no difference

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:52,090
the HTML file doesn't do anything except

00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:56,419
load the plugin so this application is

00:18:52,090 --> 00:19:00,889
very simple let's just open with

00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:03,259
something big so we can see there's

00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:07,309
there's no highlighting but it's

00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:09,590
perfectly just the simple you know this

00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:14,059
is SED for those of you don't know zamel

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,830
but no scg inkscape can exports zamel so

00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:18,139
if you want to draw a nice nice

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,119
syllabuses nice gooeys anything you go

00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:21,859
to inkscape you do whatever you want you

00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,139
to slow that you're sugs if you have

00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:25,999
them and then it's a sec sports ammo and

00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:30,970
it'll be done and you don't have to have

00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:30,970
any sort of driving code to this because

00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:37,940
here you have you have the campus on top

00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:40,100
and this wouldn't get drawn immediately

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,230
this is amplified literally you don't

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,080
even have to technically compile it you

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,539
could just load it the interpreter will

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,070
just parse it and draw it for you you

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:52,249
just want to compile it because there's

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:55,399
c-sharp code that can manipulate these

00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:56,960
objects and then do nice stuff the

00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:58,789
difference between desktop applications

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,299
and moonlight applications is that

00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:06,230
moonlights is very restricted in what it

00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:09,529
can do so the the API is that you have

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:12,710
access to our very restricted you cannot

00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:16,909
you only have one thread which is a

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:19,340
theme today which it's not exactly true

00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:22,700
but essentially you have one main thread

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,799
everything that you do any calls HTTP

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,289
calls anything that you want to do to

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,360
the outside it's completely asynchronous

00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:31,749
you cannot do synchronous call so

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,970
anything outside your app to make sure

00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:37,340
the main thread is always going no

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:40,220
matter what so you can't just freeze the

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:44,059
plug-in and probably kill the browser

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,679
along with it and also there's a very

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:48,230
limited subset of calls that you can

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,820
make on the other hand the same

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,110
application exactly 70 application

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,929
compile for the desktop has no

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,669
restrictions because it's the desktop

00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,769
it's yours it's an application you can

00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:02,929
do whatever you wanted it so you can

00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:07,100
this is basically we an interface on

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:09,889
zamel which is for those you know scg a

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,690
CT vectorial drawing with animations

00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:14,990
with videos I'm going to demo in a bit

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:18,889
with everything you really want to do

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:21,470
that you can draw on inks camp basically

00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:24,320
you can dump the work on your designers

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,090
on whatever you can drop pretty nice

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,549
vectorial things and then you can drive

00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:31,549
it with C sharp with full access to

00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:34,399
everything that dot net has to offer in

00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:36,320
terms of database access in terms of

00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:39,950
everything basically that the runtime

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,499
can do so I I like it but I'm biased

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,800
anyway you must like it because you're

00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:50,040
here so

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:57,870
anyway so that's I see let's go back to

00:21:50,040 --> 00:22:01,950
our seer yes so yes this is built so

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:04,370
ends up for compiling normal or desktop

00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:07,350
applications i'm open for running

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:11,670
desktop applications anything else is

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:16,050
the the browser so so I don't forget

00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:19,230
we've seen a hello world so let's look

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:30,930
at some demos basically what do we have

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:33,870
available ok I don't remember if I built

00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:36,230
this for the desktop or not sorry it's

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,230
too big

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:59,710
I moss is not that good okay so okay so

00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:03,460
this is something I just I was messing

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:09,310
around with just to show you different

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:11,820
types of so these are standards

00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:17,010
moonlight control Silverlight controls

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:19,780
drop-down box in there if you think so

00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:22,450
basically this is a animation the demo

00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,360
for built in animations basically so

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:37,060
different types of how to animate an

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:40,840
object so basically all the animations

00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:43,690
are done with storyboards and then you

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,060
just find animations how long do you

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,770
want them to take in what type of using

00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,020
functions that they're going to take so

00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:52,120
how are they'll delay or they will

00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,950
accelerate what type of stuff that's

00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,960
going to happen on the animations and

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,980
this is basically the demo a bunch of

00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:02,670
the storyboards that animate objects

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,770
doesn't do much else but it's running

00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:07,480
again if you compile this automotive

00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,800
develop or just ends up you can run this

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,640
on the browser it's exactly the same

00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:18,900
kernel change so that's animations you

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:21,790
can imagine taking the decorations out

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:25,930
picking these objects and then doing up

00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:27,970
doing animations on your applications

00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,060
whatever they are so if you want to I

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:35,670
don't know Twitter clients with nice

00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:38,470
Ravens whatever you can you can do it um

00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:48,490
what else

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:58,130
so next something that's working again

00:24:48,490 --> 00:25:05,960
there wasn't a month like please okay so

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:08,120
this is more detailed this is the silver

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,460
to clip the silver I treat okay so it's

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,760
basically demo of a bunch of different

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,889
controls that there that we basically

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,700
have built in you can use them it's

00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:23,600
there in the API this is over like trees

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,250
we are in the preview so not not all of

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,809
this is supported basically we have all

00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:33,139
the control but not everything is

00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:39,039
working a hundred percent ah I don't

00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:39,039
know yeah well anyway beef

00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:00,809
so the font is really small so this is

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,159
can you see it these are all the several

00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:07,080
different control some of them are

00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,059
special they come in the toolkit

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,769
themselves of the others are built in

00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:16,440
but they're here they work they were

00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:20,750
running on one night so I think this one

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,750
was cute basically okay

00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:33,629
so this is fully know okay i'm going to

00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,350
demo this video but i'm not going to

00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:39,029
demo the microsoft me Deepak I

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:41,700
purposefully will moved it because we've

00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:44,309
been doing demos with the media pack 5

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,470
okay I'm going to do the demo mix we've

00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:48,929
been doing them with a media pack and we

00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:52,710
know the media pack works I have ffmpeg

00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:55,830
here so we can see moonlights for you

00:26:52,710 --> 00:27:01,259
guys that are like vampire rules you can

00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:03,629
see moonlight doing ffmpeg for this is

00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:07,139
handy for debugging your own

00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:10,440
applications if it shows if it doesn't

00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:17,480
blow up the browser oh when it's like

00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:19,529
huge right yeah forgot this one is huge

00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,690
these are features that are not

00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:23,940
available also villite but we have them

00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:27,720
because we like them so basically you

00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:30,899
can do it you can see the entire tree of

00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:34,139
stuff that is done here because this

00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:41,669
entire gooeys then on on himself a lot

00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:46,940
so it's very big one final demo we are

00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:46,940
building up to it works

00:27:47,549 --> 00:28:06,259
okay one final hmm oh I'm sure I have

00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:06,259
it's running somewhere else again really

00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:34,739
what's the syntax okay so finally this

00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:38,639
is a pure teashop Sarah light three

00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:41,039
feature which just got working we never

00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:42,359
bereavement is working on this and we

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,200
just got it working two or three days

00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:48,960
ago well in 64 bits anyway 32 bits was

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,799
working before but I'm running 64-bit so

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,169
I wanted it to work too so basically

00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:58,889
silver y 3 has pixel shaders which take

00:28:55,169 --> 00:29:01,889
care take advantage of nice hardware

00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:03,779
that you have to dump stuff that you

00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:10,759
really want to be fast and isn't at the

00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:13,080
moment so we are implementing this and i

00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,090
don't think i ever played the driver so

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,489
it's probably it's going to be slow on

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:20,489
the video because this is an nvidia and

00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:23,330
i didn't update my GD powell whatever

00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:23,330
but

00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,520
you can see it this is running with

00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:36,000
ffmpeg on the back as the engine not

00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,220
with the binaries for what it's worth I

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,580
tried wealth on this machine it's the

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:48,540
same thing same speeds it's they're both

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:50,370
working perfectly so we're let's see so

00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,710
you can tell that it takes a bit of a

00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:55,230
hit as soon as pixel sizes go in but

00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:58,830
then again disco this little ends a week

00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:03,900
ago so it's really not been optimized

00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:08,220
but this is doing this is a this is

00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:11,669
happening live on one you can apply

00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,710
these all these effects at front time

00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:16,260
because everything is described with

00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,480
them all and that's easy to just you can

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,730
create someone flying to stump it you

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,130
can do all of this on one time and you

00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:26,760
can do all this in your applications

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:33,470
desktop or on or on the web basically so

00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:36,270
you have everything available and well

00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:41,900
that's all the time I have for I think I

00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:41,900
don't know what Q&A questions kill me

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,320
you know a graphic driver which is

00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:54,460
supported i think so i think i don't

00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,080
know when I think I'm the only one

00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:08,590
running nvidia at the moment am i well

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:10,300
I'm I just like there's the drivers

00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:13,900
are two new their stuff that's not

00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:16,720
supported yet so they we want trunk or

00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,430
whatever i'm sure i'm not running them

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,830
i'm sure i'm not running them because

00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:23,860
when I when I build stuff off of it

00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:26,110
complained that I wasn't high enough so

00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:29,170
i'm sure this is slower than it should

00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:33,060
be but yes I think read one is trying

00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,060
them with decent artwork

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:51,750
moonlight there's this the accessibility

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,940
team is on the side putting all the

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:57,809
accessibility API Sun moonlight to make

00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:00,299
sure everything goes on part they

00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:02,669
actually blow us up a lot because its

00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:05,669
accessibility just pushes the limits of

00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:07,350
it so there while we're working they're

00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:15,110
working on the site to plug everything

00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:18,590
in basically this type of disability

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,590
formal night alone

00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:26,570
find out

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,940
exactly they showed up from time to time

00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:45,260
with huge patches of accessibility to

00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:48,140
plug into our ourselves so yes we well

00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:50,960
64-bit problems is more of the disco

00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,270
which bereavement was working on 32 bits

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,620
and we needed seat weeks so we supports

00:32:53,270 --> 00:33:00,860
all linux and unix platforms in general

00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:03,650
and all major platforms none I don't

00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:11,030
know what else I am not currently aware

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:14,210
of what else we support well yeah we did

00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:17,750
support yahoo mac is yes exactly it's

00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:20,210
just we have our focuses linux and unix

00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:25,420
at the moment it their support for their

00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:28,420
buts its there's not like events

00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,420
