that's kind of cool all right so my name

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,770
is Max Spivak I have been working at Red

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,540
Hat for about five and a half years for

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,130
the last four years more or less I've

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,280
been very deeply involved in the Fedora

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,500
project and right now I am a member of

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,380
red hats community team and I've been

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,390
asked to speak today a little bit about

00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,859
fedoras governance model and I think I'm

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,619
pretty good person to talk about that

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,750
because I've been involved in fedoras

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,560
governance for quite a while and I've

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,420
seen us try different things in order to

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,440
organize the Fedora community some of

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,800
them have worked well no problem some of

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,930
them haven't and and I think though that

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,120
if we're going to talk about fedoras

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:51,059
governance model it's better to take a

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:54,899
step back and talk about how open source

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,520
communities actually get things done to

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,160
remind people about the incentives

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,109
around how those communities interact

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,449
and why people participate in men to

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,070
begin with and then to think about the

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,380
role that governance should or shouldn't

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,030
play in those communities so I wrote

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,650
this speech yesterday it's the first

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:17,130
time I've given it or we'll see how it

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:20,670
all goes I want to think about things

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:25,650
that governance is and things that

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,990
governance is not we're going to make a

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,079
list of a few things and then and then

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:39,829
sort of talk about them so governance is

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:47,280
not a starting point it's also not an

00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:50,130
end point i'll talk about this in a

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,180
little more detail in a moment and over

00:01:50,130 --> 00:02:01,909
here i want to say that governance is a

00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:01,909
way of providing process and memory

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,420
right

00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:16,910
it's a way of allowing rules to be

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:25,940
followed and decisions to be made that

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:27,650
last one is very important so one if

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,590
someone wants to create slides for my

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:34,340
talk as I give it you're more than

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,800
welcome to feel free so the Fedora

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,030
project is built on ideas it's not built

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,500
on governance right and any new idea

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,330
that somebody has or any new activity

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,370
that someone's going to take inside a

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,440
fedora or any open source community

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,480
they're going to do it because they want

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,940
to solve a problem not because they want

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,250
to create bureaucracy right and if we

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,640
think about some of the problems that

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,290
people have had that the Fedora project

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,140
has been able to help them solve over

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,820
the last few years right governance

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,590
doesn't enter into any of it until

00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,209
you're quite a long way down the road

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,310
what are some of the things people

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,950
wanted to do with fedora they wanted to

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,470
create custom versions of fedora we call

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,530
those spins right there were people who

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,560
said for years and years KDE sucks in

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:25,750
fedora and that's a problem that we want

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,190
to fix right better quality rpms a

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:36,340
problem that the fedora the project has

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:36,340
tried to solve Red Hat controls

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:44,330
translations this was another problem

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:46,340
that Fedora faced over the last few

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,320
years all of these things are problems

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,150
people have wanted to solve and the

00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,450
interesting thing then to think about is

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,390
how is how we have used governance in

00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,860
some cases to solve these problems but

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,420
to remember that we didn't start by

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,220
saying we need to create bureaucracy and

00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:08,030
that once you create some governance or

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,620
bureaucracy you have to use it and you

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,870
have to make sure that it's doing its

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,580
job and you can't just stop once you

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,230
have a bunch of rules and processes in

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,150
place or else you're not going to make

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,709
any forward progress right and what

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,780
you're trying to create in all of these

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,910
cases is a process

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,830
it can be followed and remembered as

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,860
people move in and out of volunteer

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,810
communities especially you need a way to

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,430
have some institutional memory so you

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,810
don't have to solve the same problems

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,780
and reinvent the wheel over and over

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,820
again and you need a way to make sure

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,690
that decisions can be made right there

00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:44,389
are there are it's a classic problem it

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,889
open source communities where you've got

00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,200
some communities where it is almost

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:50,930
impossible to make a decision right and

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,120
simple simple decisions can take a very

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,620
long time to be made you argue about the

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,470
same things over and over again and

00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,570
there's no one who is who is in a

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,310
position of leadership to say this is

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,419
the way it's going to be I understand

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,880
all the different points that are being

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:07,970
made but we have to make progress that's

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:13,130
what governance can provide um I don't

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:14,300
want to get too far ahead of myself in a

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,760
little bit i'm going to come back and

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,130
use these for examples once again and

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,540
talk about some of the governance that

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:25,340
exists within fedora that was created to

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,100
solve these problems but but i don't

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,490
want to go there I don't want to go

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,870
there quite yet what what is I let me

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,490
pause and see if there's any questions

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,169
or comments so far I know this is kind

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:47,930
of still just introductory yes please

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:52,479
talk loud you need to say to get into

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:55,210
the microphone hi what about

00:05:52,479 --> 00:06:00,440
communication between the members of our

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:02,210
community or local community so country

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,950
communication what about communication

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:11,210
is a problem that you have to sort it

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:14,120
out or is a problem not why i think i

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:18,039
think that i think that the questions of

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:22,340
how community of people communicates and

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:24,440
collaborates is entirely separate from

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,160
any sort of governance question at all

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,240
and actually i think if you give me a

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,460
little bit of time i'm going to talk

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,110
about this in a little while so let me

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,400
kind of get to that and then we'll see

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,729
if i don't answer your question you can

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,949
ask

00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:51,580
again any other comments so far yes

00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:55,339
please loud yeah governance is a way of

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,930
that's a good question there is a

00:06:55,339 --> 00:07:01,729
difference between governance and

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:04,009
control i would say because control if

00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:06,199
someone just if someone i feel like a

00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,460
politician now if someone if someone is

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,039
going to take control of something

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:15,050
without setting up any processes for how

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:17,659
that control is enacted that feels quite

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,610
wrong to me right but if you create a

00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:22,249
set of processes through a governance

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,770
model that allows for individuals or

00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:26,749
certain roles really that individuals

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,449
can move in or out of to have some

00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:32,809
control that sort of just makes sense

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:35,270
and as any group of individuals trying

00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:37,490
to do something gets to a certain size I

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,919
suppose it's probably inevitable at some

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:44,089
point that you need some way of control

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,969
so i guess that defendable and

00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:49,759
transparent control i would say is

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,589
governance and decisions that are just

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,439
randomly being made with no explanation

00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:57,459
or context is not governance and is

00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:03,490
probably going to doom your community

00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:03,490
pretty quickly so you like that answer

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:13,039
all right all right ok so it's also

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,899
important to remember that this is this

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,659
this next point is something that I say

00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:19,639
in new hire orientation at Red Hat I'm

00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:22,219
one of the speakers at Red Hat's new

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,719
hire orientation and I tell the people

00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:26,719
that are coming into Red Hat who have

00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:29,270
not necessarily maybe participated in

00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:30,709
open source before people often tend to

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,599
say well the open source community

00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,789
thinks this or the open source community

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,699
thinks that and I tell people there is

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,589
no open source community there are

00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:41,810
thousands of small open source

00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,669
communities some of them are one person

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,079
some of them are a group of people that

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,590
are starting to come together to do

00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,780
something but

00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:52,020
they don't all think with one voice and

00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,360
the beauty of the model is that your

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,300
you've got a system where people can all

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,860
act relatively independently and as they

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,080
find that they have interests that

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,580
coincide with each other they can choose

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,740
to group together and linux

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,300
distributions like Fedora provide a

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,220
synchronization clock to these thousands

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,830
of communities that allow people to know

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,600
that if they can if everyone kind of

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,060
gets their act together in certain

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,890
milestones then eventually it all comes

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,530
together in a distribution that provides

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,750
some nice nice presentation to the world

00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:28,770
and allows you to get eyeballs and users

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:31,260
and viewers of your stuff but because

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:35,160
each community produces its own code and

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:37,080
has its own rules and processes even

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,280
within the Fedora project which is just

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:44,240
a bunch of small communities itself the

00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,190
governance has to be in my opinion as

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,200
limited as possible in order to have

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,410
organization and in order for people to

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,390
get things done but I think we always

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,240
have to be wary of creating more

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,280
governance than is actually needed to do

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,940
something so that makes me a certain

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,720
political slant so be it but I think

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,370
that in volunteer communities when you

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,470
start to do stuff with governance it

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,470
becomes very dangerous and you have an

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,820
opportunity to really screw up if you

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,250
don't do it right and nobody really

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,350
likes doing governance everyone rather

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,780
work on code or work on the other things

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,280
that they need to do but when you do

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,200
need to bring some order and structure

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,320
to your community it's important to kind

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:33,420
of have thought about how you want to do

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,830
it um and I guess that gets into I guess

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,020
that kind of gets into this point over

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,490
here or I say that governance is not an

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,100
end point you don't create governance

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,320
just to have governance right that's

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,650
that's that's a little too that's a

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,970
little too recursive for my taste you

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,380
need to have the smallest amount of

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,240
governance necessary to get things

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,150
organized and I think your governance

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,070
needs to be adaptable and flexible one

00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,020
of the governance groups that we have

00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,180
within the Fedora project it's called

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,100
the Fedora ambassador steering committee

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,260
and it's been around for what four or

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,899
five years something like that now right

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,660
five years it's been around for five

00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,220
years and the things that the things

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,930
that that steering committee did five

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,660
years ago and the things that they do

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,310
today are entirely different and I think

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,790
that's a good thing right it is shown

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,230
that the reason we have in fedora

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,000
ambassador steering committee first of

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,320
all is because of all the different

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,270
parts of the Fedora project the

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,550
ambassador's group those are the people

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,589
who are responsible for making sure

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,440
there's a fedora booth at an event like

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:37,410
foz dem or making sure that we have sort

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,360
of an on-the-ground Evangelization team

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,790
for fedora everywhere in the world it's

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,440
the most spread out and most distributed

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,339
of all the different sub pieces of the

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,040
Fedora project it's also the most

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:52,110
diverse in terms of languages right and

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,089
the Fedora ambassador steering committee

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,950
is comes together to provide a little

00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,290
bit of central organization around that

00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:02,089
and five years ago when we first created

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:06,240
it the problems that it faced were

00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:08,640
basically what is the purpose even of an

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,680
ambassador's project within fedora what

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,930
does an event look like how do we know

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,200
what events the Fedora project wants to

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,720
go to how do we organize a booth how do

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,190
you have a you know a process for an

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,380
event owner how does that event owner

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,779
find any sort of budget to do things

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,600
right very logistical questions in

00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:29,880
nature as we have grown that governance

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,650
body has evolved and it is stopped

00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,680
worrying about those things which is a

00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,450
success case right we have regional basa

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,670
der groups all over the world that are

00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,290
basically self-sufficient and now the

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,480
Fedora ambassador steering committee

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,900
really only worries about two major

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,040
things number one a managing budget and

00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,750
watching to make sure that it's

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,270
relatively distributed around the world

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:54,390
and number two is sort of the training

00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:56,160
and mentoring process of new ambassador

00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,200
worldwide in this guy right here York

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,959
Simon actually is in charge of that he

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,000
does a phenomenal job with it the point

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,490
is that this governance body which is

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,110
only seven people out of Fedora

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:12,600
community that's thousands of people

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:14,160
large its scope is limited and what it

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,310
does over time changes

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,899
it hasn't been afraid to say we don't

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,819
need to worry about this thing anymore

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,310
we don't need to have control or power

00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:24,690
over this particular item and it's able

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,060
to give it away so I think it's

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,889
important to realize that just because

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,259
you needed some governance at one point

00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:33,360
in time doesn't mean that governance

00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:37,259
always has to continue and you have to

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,509
not be afraid to dismantle or change the

00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,740
the goals of that governance as it goes

00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:42,089
on I spent there's a lot of Fedora

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,850
people in this room I spent a bunch of

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:47,490
time last night trying to think of an

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,670
example where we actually have

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:54,060
dismantled completely some sort of

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,470
governance structure that existed and I

00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,319
couldn't I couldn't think of one where

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,720
we actually said we no longer need this

00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:03,180
this governance because all it's doing

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:08,430
is having bureaucracy can anyone think

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:10,649
of one I could think of plenty of cases

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,939
where the scope of the of the governance

00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:14,430
changed but I couldn't think of one

00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:16,470
where we where we completely threw it

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,810
away and I think that's I think that's a

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:22,319
problem right if this room was full

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,300
entirely of Fedora people and and and

00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,250
from all over the part of the project

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,050
and a lot of the engineering parts of

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,899
the project I would argue to all of

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:33,089
those people that even fedora which

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,130
tries to think very carefully about its

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:36,420
governance structure has too much of it

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,689
and I think that one of the things that

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:41,189
Fedora needs to do is try to reduce the

00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:45,839
total amount of governance and

00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:47,610
bureaucracy that it has let me see if

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,170
I've covered let me see if I've covered

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,240
all of this stuff I'm going to get to

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:57,420
this a little bit later i'm still going

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:59,189
to get to this in fact i'm going to do

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:06,059
that right now unless there's any any

00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:08,130
questions or comments yes dimitrios this

00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,110
is only supposed to be so that the video

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,660
camera picks up what I'm saying so I

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:21,800
just have to project can you hear me

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:21,800
okay water break let's see

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,020
alright so let's talk a little bit about

00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,900
let's talk a little bit about some of

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,780
the the way governance actually looks in

00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,480
fedora so this is the governance

00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:50,010
mountain and it starts with the

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:53,340
individual as I said before the the the

00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,500
core the core of our community and it's

00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,210
so obvious it's silly to repeat it is

00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,800
people who want to do something right

00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,930
every person who is involved in the

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,940
Fedora project is doing it for a reason

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,560
right either they're trying to learn

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,300
something themselves about open source

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,220
or they're trying to make something

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,650
better in either the part of the world

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,130
where they live or the the code that

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:15,690
they care about they have their own

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,370
goals and they have their own reasons

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,530
and they have their own motivations and

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,740
they have their own incentives and every

00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:24,810
single one of those people is right

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,060
right one of the fundamental one of the

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,820
fundamental principles I think that a

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,070
community like Fedora is built on an

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,320
especially a community that is so deeply

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,540
volunteer-driven is that anything that

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,240
you want to be able to do within that

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,970
community as long as it follows the

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,650
basic values of that community should be

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,290
acceptable right and no one should tell

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,000
you that it's right or wrong and so we

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:51,360
have individuals who do all sorts of

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,760
crazy stuff in fedora right and and

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,010
sooner or later those individuals find

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,650
other people who are equal equally crazy

00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,950
or crazy about the same things and they

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:04,200
kind of band together to form regional

00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,690
you know regional teams we've got the

00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:11,970
sort of ambassador leadership team in

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:14,310
Europe we've got the people that take

00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,960
care of I don't know I'm drawing a blank

00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,240
but we've got we get all sorts of people

00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,480
that voluntarily sort of join together

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,010
as they realize well you know the three

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,720
of us are all doing something is ninety

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,210
percent the same let's pool our efforts

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,890
let's pool our resources we become we

00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:32,610
become a little more efficient in what

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:34,510
we're trying to do and yet I'm going to

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,120
get to that in a second yeah

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:39,730
the point I want to make is that at this

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,100
level there is no governance at all yet

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,330
right you've got people that are just

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,620
doing what they think is right and

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,600
they're working together and they're

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,250
collaborating with other folks and there

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,090
is no governance model no one's had to

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,010
ask permission to do anything in fact I

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,450
think one of the hallmarks of the Fedora

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,480
community is that we we provide

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,760
permission by default right you don't

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,770
have to ask permission of anybody in

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,810
order to get something done and you can

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,880
get a whole heck of a lot done without

00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:11,280
any sort of governance at all all this

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:15,190
is is communication right the key to

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,560
successful open projects is not to build

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,410
bureaucracy around it but to have open

00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,540
mailing list to have a road map a public

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,060
road map that says here are our five

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,530
most important goals in a prioritized

00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,140
order and what we're trying to get done

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,960
in the next year this isn't governance

00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,720
this is just transparent project

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:40,420
management and you can get a really long

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:42,370
way just on that now the place where

00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,650
governance starts to come into things in

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,200
the Fedora project as yarn said at the

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,630
next level is what we call a special

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,990
interest group and a special interest

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:57,340
group in fedora is a very very low level

00:18:52,990 --> 00:19:01,180
of governance in fact mostly it's just a

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,890
way of kind of formalizing the things

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,290
that some people care about so we have a

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:09,460
special interest group in fedora around

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:12,610
fonts and that group they try to package

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:15,660
up one new font every week and get it

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:18,400
into the Fedora project they advertise

00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,140
freely licensed fonts that they find out

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,750
there in the internet that need to be

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,670
packaged they talk about it on the

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,650
Fedora blogs every week and they try to

00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,600
get people to who have packaging

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,520
expertise to show up and help them

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,100
package and add more and more fonts to

00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,840
fedora a couple of weeks ago the Fedora

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,230
project started its cloud special

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,660
interest group with a single goal of

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:43,210
trying to make Fedora images for Amazon

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,450
ec2 not suck right the last working

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,370
fedora image on ec2 was Fedora eight

00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,740
we're now at fedora 12

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:53,110
they've decided that is horrible and our

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,180
goal as a group of people is to make

00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:58,000
that not suck and and and the special

00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,920
interest group model all it does is say

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,300
we're going to create a mailing list for

00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,130
this we're going to create a wiki page

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:07,330
for this we're just going to have a

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:09,400
little bit of organization so that as

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,410
other people start to hear about what

00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,080
we're doing and care about it they have

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:16,210
somewhere that they can come no clear

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,640
leader right as complete meritocracy

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:22,179
whoever is doing the work and projecting

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:25,780
the vision is in the leadership role no

00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:27,730
expectations either right a special

00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,460
interest group within the Fedora project

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:33,460
can be wildly successful or can fail

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,590
miserably and it won't have a bad impact

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,960
on the final Fedora distribution that we

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,179
make every six months right there's a

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:47,070
lot of freedom to experiment and try new

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:47,070
things and these two problems really

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:53,920
having more customized versions of

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:57,370
fedora and making KDE a better in fedora

00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:00,130
were both solved with with sort of the

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,900
special interest group governance model

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,600
right we have a fedora or we have a

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,179
spins special interest group that has

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,500
come together with some process around

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:13,750
how you create pardon me how you create

00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,320
any custom version of fedora yarn you're

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:26,260
in charge of that right say what it does

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:29,050
will I get my voice back madura and it

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,030
regulates what you can and cannot do in

00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,970
a customized version of fedora that is

00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:36,730
then finally targeted to be released as

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,850
part of fedora so there's there's no

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:43,110
like customizations that might finally

00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:46,870
break a user system and we verify that

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:49,270
we have a process for the rest of the

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,820
government's model to also participate

00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,730
at a certain point and we have we we

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:58,540
safeguard those processes basically how

00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:02,680
many people are five we show up

00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:04,270
regularly 17 on the list and how many

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,730
how many spins of Fedora have you guys

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:11,040
managed to get through the process Oh 12

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:13,420
in total 10 currently pretty good

00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,940
similarly I don't know if any of the

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,730
Fedora que te people are here or any of

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:23,680
you here it's a really incredible

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:25,540
success case because in my opinion and I

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,320
think that the people who use que te and

00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:31,810
Fedora would confirm this for years ago

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,630
the Fedora KDE compared to other

00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:37,120
distributions que te offering I think

00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,090
fedora was pretty far behind and the

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,010
work that this group of people have done

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:44,440
to improve the quality of KDE and Fedora

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,930
is nothing short of phenomenal and it's

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,850
been entirely volunteer driven and I

00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:52,210
guess the point as it relates back to

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:55,510
governance is they did it all without

00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,400
any sort of layer of oversight or or

00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:01,510
permission asking or anything that had

00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,280
to happen right an individual group of

00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,950
people simply motivated to get things

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,370
done and who did it who did it

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:11,140
relatively a you know transparently the

00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,560
next level of governance that we have in

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,880
fedora is what we call the project

00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,970
somewhat overloaded word because there

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,040
is the Fedora project and then there are

00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:23,080
the projects within fedora we call like

00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,730
the Fedora sub-projects the fidor

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,080
infrastructure project the Fedora

00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:30,640
marketing project the Fedora

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:35,110
documentation project the Fedora release

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,580
engineering etc etc and from the Fedora

00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:40,480
point of view this is where we actually

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:43,270
do start to get some level of governance

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,430
and and and process right and before I

00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:50,530
talk about a little more about what that

00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:52,810
is I want to say that I think that if

00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,180
you if you're if you're responsible sort

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,910
of for the larger vision of any open

00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,550
source community you should think about

00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,230
how far you can get and the answer is

00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:06,070
you can get really really really far

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:08,200
with virtually no governance model being

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,180
need to put in place right and if you're

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,510
thinking to yourself we've got a whole

00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,370
bunch of problems and it seems like a

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,480
governance board is the only thing that

00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,340
we could use to solve

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,190
those problems I think first you need to

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,020
take a step back and ask yourself how

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,429
well are we doing on making sure that

00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,370
all communication is happening on

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:29,590
mailing list how are we doing on posting

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,330
logs of IRC meetings so that everyone

00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,070
can see it are we having private

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,870
conversations and never get back out to

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:38,200
the community do we have a road map

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,179
that's public that shows people you know

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,309
what we care about and where we're going

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,900
and prevent some sort of a vision and

00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:45,580
make sure you answer all of those

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,040
questions first and if you're doing all

00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,900
that stuff great and you're still at the

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,210
point where you still need a little bit

00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,320
of centralized organization fine but

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,299
first make sure you're doing the

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,020
fundamentals right before you go and

00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:00,309
start to spend time building building

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,720
any sort of governance because there's

00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:04,480
an opportunity cost there because you

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:08,580
can't do other things in the Fedora

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:14,830
level something that is a fedora project

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:17,980
is critically important right and if it

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:21,640
doesn't go right the ramifications of

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:23,380
that are pretty much ferment any level

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,990
from really unfortunate to totally

00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,000
disastrous for the Fedora project right

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,340
if fedoras release engineering and

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,760
infrastructure processes fall completely

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,530
apart we have no websites we have no

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,570
build system we have no way of

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:40,630
distributing Fedora to anybody yeah

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,960
we're dead right if the food if the

00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,820
Fedora ambassador project falls apart

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,070
then I'm not standing here giving this

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,470
talk right there's nobody around the

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:53,650
world helping to spread fedora into

00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:55,860
universities helping to grow new you

00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:59,200
know hoping to grow new contributors and

00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,910
and recruiting new people to join the

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,130
Fedora project and participate because

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,990
new contributors are the lifeblood of

00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,850
any open source project right people get

00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,710
married people have kids people get

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,570
different jobs people can't contribute

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,890
as much as they used to so if there

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,590
aren't new people coming into your

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:18,340
project all the time you're you're

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,750
you're you're you're in trouble my voice

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:27,010
is starting to run out so I'm going to

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:29,830
try to move quickly to the end um here's

00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:30,840
my Oh hold on let me finish these two

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,279
things

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,110
one of the goals that people had in

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:39,640
fedora was we need to make sure we have

00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:42,340
high quality rpms right governance was

00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,950
not really a solution for this we have a

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,720
packaging committee in fedora which is a

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,120
few people who are experts at building

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,720
packages who maintain a set of packaging

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,150
guidelines right we have process around

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,140
making sure that our pms are built

00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:01,270
consistently I can have some QA and and

00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,370
things like that but there's not there's

00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,409
not a and to the extent that you would

00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:07,360
call process governance then I suppose

00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:11,649
we have some governance there but

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,510
there's no you know there's no there's

00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:15,010
no king of fedora packaging who makes

00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:20,230
the final decision right there's a group

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:21,820
of people who by acclamation own fedoras

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,100
packaging guidelines they own it because

00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,529
they're the experts in that area not

00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,419
because someone said okay you who've

00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:31,659
never written a package before you're

00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:34,240
now in charge of fedora packaging um so

00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:36,429
it's it's very much the meritocracy I

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,409
suppose right I think I think that by

00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:40,510
being true two meritocracy and letting

00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:43,059
the best at smartest people in a

00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:45,460
particular subject have that leadership

00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,950
and encouraging them to take that

00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,350
leadership that's a much more organic

00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:52,990
form of governance than saying well we

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:55,090
have all these roles of you knows our of

00:27:52,990 --> 00:28:00,940
this and leader of that and president of

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:02,529
this that have to be filled yeah the

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,600
other problem that we had over time was

00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:08,950
red hat red hat had too much control

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:11,919
over the translation process for a long

00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:13,690
time it was very difficult it was very

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,330
difficult as a community member to do a

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,580
good job of participating in the process

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:22,120
of translating everything that Fedora

00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:25,000
goes through and how did we solve this

00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,409
problem what what kind of governance did

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,450
we use to solve that problem well

00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:31,659
actually I would say we use pretty

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:34,659
strong governance there we started by

00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:37,059
finding the people outside of red hat

00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:40,210
Demetrius right here is is the the main

00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:42,429
guy who understood the problems around

00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,910
translation and care deeply about

00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,040
solving them

00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:48,350
enabled those people and when I say we

00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:53,180
here I guess I have to get to the last

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:55,100
level which is the fedora board I'll

00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,080
talk about what they do in a minute we

00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,000
enabled the those people who cared the

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,420
most about translation and understood it

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,430
to go and attack that problem and said

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,020
forget about the way we currently do

00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,820
things if you were going to sort of

00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,980
start over and you had an opportunity to

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:13,220
fix this problem from scratch how would

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:15,050
you do it and with that freedom they

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,910
were able to build a fedora localization

00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,770
project they were able to create some

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:21,470
new software called transifex and that

00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:23,810
has been so successful and done so well

00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:26,210
that it's led to its own company right

00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:28,010
this is the first the first example of a

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,380
spin-off company out of the Fedora

00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,120
project how incredible is that right its

00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,430
own company that is that is working to

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,280
try to get translations done all across

00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:40,550
the open sores ecosystem right um and

00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,890
that and that's not because of a good

00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:45,470
governance model anywhere again it's

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,660
because of people with a vision willing

00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:52,130
to do hard work and governance didn't

00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:54,560
get in their way um the last thing I

00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,900
want to say before my get into my end

00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,980
end part of the talk is because I am

00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,660
supposed to talk about fedoras

00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,730
governance model there's this thing

00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,580
called the fedora board it's like any

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:08,110
other board I suppose it's fedoras sort

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:11,210
of strategic executive committee right

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,500
if there is a problem that doubles all

00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,440
the way up to the top of the chain and

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,930
no one can make a decision it's the

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,710
fedora fedora board's responsibility to

00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:25,880
make that decision the Fedora board to

00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:29,210
some extent has an ability to i would

00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:33,070
say suggest strategy right it's a it's a

00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:35,450
it's a vantage point and and a platform

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,070
by which they can say here are the

00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,570
things that we think are most important

00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,760
to the Fedora project but they can't

00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,650
mandate they can't mandate anything

00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,720
right in an open source community like

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,150
Fedora a vision and a strategy is only

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,460
as successful as the people willing to

00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:51,520
rally around that vision and follow it

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:56,990
but nonetheless we have a fedora board

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:57,500
made up of our community members um who

00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,840
are

00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,510
responsible for sort of the overall

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,190
direction of fedora and the chairman of

00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,190
that board is a person who fills the job

00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,810
role of the Fedora project leader and

00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:11,540
and and and that person in the end is

00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:14,120
ultimately at least from red hats

00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,380
perspective right the Fedora project

00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,060
leader is considered ultimately

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:21,020
accountable for the successes of Fedora

00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:23,450
project and why do I think that's

00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,480
important I do think it is important

00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:29,120
ultimately because decisions have to get

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,610
made right and you need a person in this

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,510
job who's of the right personality and

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:37,790
is not sort of a dictatorial wanting to

00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,710
take and seize control sort of person

00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,390
you need someone who's going to talk to

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,740
everybody you need someone who's going

00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,630
to listen to the smartest people that

00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,880
they know and sort of try to do what

00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,280
those people say and take five really

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,350
smart visions and condense them into one

00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,270
plan forward but you do need somebody

00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,430
who and it does happen when a problem

00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,350
goes all the way up and it even comes to

00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,940
the board level and the Fedora board

00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,890
can't decide because it's difficult

00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,440
problem you need someone who can say

00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:05,060
here's what we're going to try just so

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,890
we can move forward and if it turns out

00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,200
it was a wrong decision we can admit

00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,730
that in a couple of months and try

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,350
something else but but you kind of do

00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:17,590
need that final that that final that

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,790
final decision making point I believe

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,710
you know when we go to questions and

00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:28,640
answer feel free to push back on me if

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:30,380
you don't agree the last thing I want to

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,270
say the last two things I want to say

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:37,880
are sort of the final points governance

00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:40,130
is not vision governance is not

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,550
motivational right I don't think anyone

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,080
has ever been inspired to do anything

00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,790
because of a governance model right

00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,420
governance models make me want to fall

00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:52,790
asleep people make me want to do

00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,460
something ideas make me want to do

00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:58,180
something right problems within fedora

00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,440
that I care about and I want to solve

00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,880
that's the sort of stuff that inspires

00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,920
me right in the in the years that I

00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,870
participated in fedora you know I've

00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,520
been inspired by the idea of growing

00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,679
regional leadership teams around the

00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,059
world I've been inspired by the idea of

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,490
making sure

00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:16,509
that the experience of contributing to

00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:19,669
Fedora is as similar as possible

00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:22,759
regardless of whether you are a senior

00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:25,730
engineer at red hat or a college student

00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:30,019
who is just learning how to you know how

00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:32,090
to code right I've been inspired by the

00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:34,330
idea of trying to provide as much

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:37,070
transparency as possible into fedora

00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,019
these are these are ideas these are

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,960
missions that's what people rally around

00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:45,049
and that's what people want to do so

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,639
again setting up governance because you

00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:50,899
don't know what else to do in your

00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:52,610
project is not a good idea right make

00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:54,350
sure that you have a vision make sure

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,480
that you can articulate that vision in

00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,249
public and make sure that if someone

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,980
comes to you and says I think that

00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:03,440
vision is cool how can I help you have

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,179
an answer for them right again check

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,340
those sorts of things before you start

00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:08,599
building or thinking about governance

00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,470
models because those are far more

00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,940
important to the healthier project the

00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:16,940
last point I want to make also is that

00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,550
governance is not a set of beliefs or

00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:22,429
values right those have to come from the

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,780
organization as well there's a book that

00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:25,399
everybody in this room should read

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:30,760
called the starfish and the spiders

00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:35,060
anyone read it or heard of it few people

00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:39,490
the starfish and the spider and it talks

00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:41,990
about sort of the anatomy of leaderless

00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:44,480
organizations right and one of the

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:47,750
points that that book makes is that an

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,629
organization doesn't come up with values

00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,970
but rather the values itself are the

00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:55,010
organization right and fedoras for key

00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:59,089
values the four foundations of Fedora

00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:01,130
freedom friends features and first those

00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:04,099
came from the community right those came

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,930
out of conversations that we had at

00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,960
fedora user and developer conferences

00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,569
mailing lists conversations thinking and

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,560
talking and arguing about what

00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:14,780
fundamentally is most important to the

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,210
people who join this community and those

00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,280
are the values that start with the

00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:21,170
individual contributor and have to be

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,210
reflected all the way up the

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,589
organization and through any governance

00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,359
that we build you

00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:28,849
can't have people say kid have one

00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:30,559
person say here's our values and push it

00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:33,019
down the values have to go from bottom

00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,390
up the values are the organization and

00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:36,829
if you want to think more about this you

00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,279
should read that book the starfish on

00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:41,900
the spider because it's pretty cool and

00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:43,940
I guess that's more or less all I wanted

00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,130
to say we got a few minutes for sort of

00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:50,660
questions and comments and all that so

00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:52,579
talk loud and whatever yeah so fast gone

00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:57,829
from scarf it into this entire press

00:35:52,579 --> 00:36:00,319
conf amsco 15 committees yeah some of

00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:08,539
the Fedora projects have steering

00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:11,180
committees um I don't know how to

00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:17,450
describe them it's a small group of

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:19,279
people who who do the boring work maybe

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,380
on some level I mean someone else answer

00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:25,660
it for me how would you describe it

00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:28,489
Yaakov you've been around basically the

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,589
steering committees are a level above

00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:31,940
the sex where decisions bubble up

00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:35,029
through them and they make the critical

00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,739
decisions of how do projects get

00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:39,589
implemented for example in the case of

00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:41,150
the photo ambassadors the femme SCO's

00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:43,160
decided how we're going to be doing the

00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,960
whole structure of the mentoring program

00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,910
and what are the criteria we were

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,160
looking for who's going to be a mentor

00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,779
who do we prove as mentors and what are

00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,180
the ground rules for the entire program

00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:56,089
and maintain the program's functionality

00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:59,299
and in the case of fesco or in the case

00:36:56,089 --> 00:37:01,519
of say the basically for the packaging

00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:03,229
committee which is half the people in

00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,150
fesco packaging committee at one point

00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:06,170
or another in their career these are the

00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,910
people who are making a lot of the

00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,279
engineering decisions of what is allowed

00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:12,979
what's not allowed technical decisions

00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:14,239
highly detailed professional decisions

00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:18,499
that people have to make and then have

00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:20,210
to get done so I'm trying to figure out

00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:22,309
what the business term is it for that in

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:25,009
terms of an organization but they're

00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:26,210
basically the people who are the vice

00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:31,489
president's of different organizations

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:33,499
within a corporation it allows it allows

00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:37,599
the most critical and complicated pieces

00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:37,599
of the Fedora project to have a

00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:42,340
a representation when talking to each

00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:45,220
other by a small group of people right I

00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,920
think about the the release readiness

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:50,140
meetings that we have where we get

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,080
together the you know one person from

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,270
infrastructure ambassadors marketing you

00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,910
know engineering QA we get together one

00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:00,280
person who's sort of is appointed to be

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:02,410
the spokesperson for that part of the

00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,210
Fedora project and as we get close to a

00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,740
release we get all those people together

00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,630
to make sure that all the different

00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,430
pieces of fedora or kind of working

00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:12,400
together that's governance but it's

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,290
pretty lightweight and its governance in

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,560
the interest of making sure that we have

00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:20,530
some transparency and good communication

00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,450
as opposed to governance just for the

00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,880
sake of having meetings or something

00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,520
like that right yes I'd say that though

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,730
steering committees are a tool to get

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,560
stuff done so that you have three people

00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:36,120
to decide and we represent the community

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:39,850
and the second is accountability right

00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:42,190
right yeah so I have a question of the

00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:44,350
governance at the level of sig groups

00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,210
yeah so you said that there you have

00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,280
Mary toket meritocracy which is okay

00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,350
it's normal it works in most cases young

00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,410
but in in some cases if you don't have

00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,910
like the fact organized person which is

00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,980
like kind of the leader you can have two

00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,810
people which took me to pull out of

00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,940
works and at some time they arrive at a

00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,620
conflict just a at the vatican all

00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,690
decision on which they do not agree

00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:10,870
shall we have a standard method to get

00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:13,480
on this kind of situation at the level

00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:15,670
of a special interest group for example

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,680
the feet the people who are working on

00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:19,210
the cloud stuff for fedora right they

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,390
want to get fedora stuff working with

00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:25,110
Amazon if there's two people who are

00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:28,840
arguing two different methodologies and

00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:32,020
they both seem good and the decision

00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:35,380
can't be made uh actually nobody is

00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:37,000
going to step in right that no no no no

00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,640
steering committee member who's been

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,950
elected by the community no fedora board

00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,900
member fedora project leader is going to

00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,870
step in and say all right this guy is

00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,310
going to do it maybe people will you

00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,960
know you have to separate the role that

00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,280
somebody fills from the person

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,430
themselves maybe

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,020
somebody who's an expert in fedora

00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,580
engineering and is therefore on the

00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,590
Fedora engineering steering committee

00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,840
might read the mailing list thread and

00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,280
say well you know I've read this and

00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,770
I've thought about it and my personal

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,200
opinion is you know this idea is better

00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,850
for these reasons and maybe that'll tip

00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,160
the balance and help make a decision be

00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:13,870
made but that's that's just the

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,210
community being the community that's not

00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,220
someone saying because I fill a certain

00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,690
role you will listen to me and I think

00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:25,480
that's a very important distinction

00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:27,040
right I somebody I can't take credit for

00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,410
what I'm about to say because I read it

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,600
on the Fedora advisory board mailing

00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:34,450
list somebody sort of made the point of

00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,700
saying that especially in a volunteer

00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:38,560
community if you are elected to a

00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,090
leadership role you have to remember

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,460
that you've been elected to that role

00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:44,680
because of the achievements that you've

00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,170
made in that community and also because

00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,890
the rest of the community is trusting

00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:55,840
you that you will you know that you will

00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:58,270
speak on behalf of them and not place

00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:02,020
your own sort of personal agenda at the

00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:03,550
top so you know it's important to put

00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,940
people in leadership positions in a

00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:08,650
volunteer community who are going to

00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,720
remember be humbled by that and remember

00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:12,610
that gives them extra responsibilities

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,500
as opposed to someone who sees that as

00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,810
sort of an ego boost right I think

00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,120
that's another another potential danger

00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,710
of governance and open source

00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,810
communities is that you don't want it to

00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,490
you know if you put the wrong people in

00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,780
leadership positions where it thinks it

00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,490
makes them a god or something like that

00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,550
you're going to have very very big

00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:32,770
problems yes please follow up on that

00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:35,740
project leader a member of the boat or a

00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:38,800
comprar completely separate entity l if

00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:41,650
so why is the federal project leader a

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,570
member of the fedora board the Fedora

00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,910
project yeah the Fedora board has nine

00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:48,880
people on it the Fedora project leader

00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:50,260
is sort of the tenth person and is the

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,290
chairman of that board and is

00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:55,240
responsible for making sure that the

00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:58,420
things that board talks about have a

00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,860
purpose and a meaning when it comes time

00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,160
for the board to actually vote on

00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:05,910
something the Fedora project leader

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,910
doesn't really get a vote

00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:12,830
but usually and I think this is a nice

00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:16,250
thing in fedora we have seen that most

00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:18,410
part the Fedora board tends to continue

00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,630
to discuss an issue until they more or

00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,790
less get a consensus right if something

00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:25,070
is split down the middle we don't just

00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,420
say all right well it's five to four or

00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:28,550
will let the Fedora project leader

00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,820
decide we continue to talk about things

00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:34,430
until until enough people are convinced

00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,780
to feel like they can all kind of buy

00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,920
into the decision and sometimes that

00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,770
makes things take a little bit longer

00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:43,340
but I think ultimately it's a nicer way

00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:46,060
to do business anyone anyone can jump in

00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:49,120
if I'm saying something wrong by the way

00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,120
