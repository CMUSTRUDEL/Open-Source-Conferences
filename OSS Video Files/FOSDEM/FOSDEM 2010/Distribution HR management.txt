okay hello everyone we work laptop don't

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,460
have an install gentoo on it because the

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,070
employer didn't allow it but works for

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:16,529
this one seems at least faster than

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:20,789
usual with linux n and the presentation

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:24,570
anyway about myself magento recruiting

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:30,300
lead councilmember and java team lead

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:32,279
have been for some years now and i study

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,940
at them all to university in finland

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,040
applied mathematics anyway the agenda

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,140
today is to take a look a little bit at

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,540
lower level than last talk was a little

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,110
bit governance that may be in a larger

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,559
scale and here our water distribution

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,719
that's things about recruiting retiring

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,690
people and getting rid of bad apples in

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,300
the end other people here who are

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:02,250
involved in these activities in other

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:06,000
distributions nope oh well maybe we

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:10,200
don't get discussion still from even if

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,420
you're not involved okay I'm chained to

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,130
a from source sample distribution in

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,280
contrast to binaries that usually come

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,710
with Ubuntu Fedora and so that and can

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,710
be customized what do we want the

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,140
Colonel's not doesn't have to be Linux

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:33,020
can be bsd journals and kernels and

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,520
things like that okay so white people

00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,759
contribute in the first place as Max

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,610
said in last talked it solves a problem

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,119
for them of course you can always pay

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,520
people to work as far as i know not many

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,649
people get paid to work on gentoo to

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,350
actual actual packaging and things like

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:56,939
that make it pay to be a system

00:01:52,350 --> 00:02:00,329
administrator but not actually develop

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,100
things and it's fun for many people if

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:07,649
it's not fun they usually quit which

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:10,379
will come to later okay so how big is

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,060
the organization and why you have

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,060
something in to talk at the beginning

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,650
winded

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:22,690
at the moment we check our developer

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:27,760
information in ldap it's 264 people so

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:30,310
you can't just get it let it run to what

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,220
they want too many for that we saw on

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,959
last presentation in a smaller scale it

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,750
works without the rules and things like

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,250
that but with hundreds of people you

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,330
need to start thinking about on a larger

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,720
scale and actually do some governance

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:49,269
last year who's 30 people who joined and

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,209
35 the year before that there's

00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:54,489
currently four people in the recruitment

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:57,310
team of which three are inactive I'm the

00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:00,280
only exit one so most of those people go

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,430
through me at some point not all of them

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,290
write code like seen before we need

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:12,459
people writing documentation doing legal

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:15,720
stuff marketing PR things like that the

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:18,040
beginning of this slideshare I have some

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,780
statistical information to give some

00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,480
background of what kind of people

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,519
contribute to open source if you're

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,019
doing human resources you need to know

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,900
about the resources you're managing I

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:32,470
can it can you see the numbers the below

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,840
are they do small bit small okay and I

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,019
can just explain on the left side it's a

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:42,100
divided into blocks of five years by age

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:46,450
and left you have 15 to 20 and a little

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,810
right you have 55 or over so most of the

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:52,870
people are in the big block here 89

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:56,260
between the age of 25 and 30 and the

00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:00,850
smaller blocks beside them are 20 to 25

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:02,739
and 30 to 35 so naturally this means and

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,060
probably the older people aren't add

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:09,190
that into computers at large and

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,109
probably before the age of 15 you're

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,370
probably more interested in computer

00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:15,160
games and things like that and actually

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,979
open source development and maybe hear

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,060
about it later it's interesting to see

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:25,240
how will develop and coming years I had

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,910
this same slide last year for a

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,820
different presentation and

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:35,240
for that it's shifting to the right so

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:41,250
we'll see if the trend continues okay

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:44,880
geographical distribution how this

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,310
information is built every developer has

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,060
the opportunity recorder coordinates

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:55,050
into the ldap and then there we have on

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:59,340
our website Google Maps overlay which

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:02,010
places everyone on the map and no it's

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,110
not a mistake there's one guy in the

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,620
middle of the ocean he's actually over

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,330
there laughing most of the people as can

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,510
be seen on from the United States or

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,430
Europe which is quite natural as you

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,190
need to be quite fluid in English to be

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,250
able to contribute but if everyone has

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,110
suggestions you have to get more people

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,360
involved us there's probably a large

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,120
community of open source contributions

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,640
like Brussels and Southern America in

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,430
general but how to get them involved in

00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,280
gentoo and things like that I'd have no

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:42,660
idea but probably because many people

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:44,340
get was there a message for me okay many

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,550
people get involved through their

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,840
friends if you have a large population

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,110
in some location like for example

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,000
Germany they pull in there the people

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,480
they know and it starts to grow but if

00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you have no one like in China then it's

00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,560
kind of hard to them to get involved and

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,640
they have their own distributions which

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:13,640
they probably contribute instead of

00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:17,730
gentoo how do users become developers

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,980
well first you contribute in some way

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,710
initial contact and then you have a

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,120
contribution probably bugzilla or you

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,520
have need to package something and then

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,620
you start thinking about how without

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,880
packages you find some documentation ask

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:35,460
an IRC then you contribute more and when

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,820
you have contributed enough you start to

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,740
get sucked in by someone hopefully and

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,380
he starts to mentor you

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,750
we have an official process for bringing

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,620
the people in why we have no official

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:52,440
process because we have CBS access it

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,020
means you can commit packages right to

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,090
the you end-user systems so if you give

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:01,130
freely everyone access it just means

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:05,340
that well I could commit LMFAO root

00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:11,940
quite easily so it's not nice probably

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:15,120
user don't want that okay but still

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,000
there's downsides it's a very steep

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,220
learning curve and it's quite easy to

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,659
get bored in the middle of process like

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,060
this and you never make it to the end

00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:25,970
and of course the end goal is to recruit

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,919
as many people as you want into a

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:33,960
process or the protocol or distribution

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:35,430
because I is there anyone here who is

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:46,590
involved in a process where there's too

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:48,360
many people doing work no are you

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,759
involved in an open source project where

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,120
there's too many coders or too many

00:07:50,759 --> 00:08:01,219
people writing documentation that you

00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:06,500
don't need more resources so we have a

00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:08,909
mentoring program so we put people are

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,789
older developers are in charge of the

00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:13,830
new guys for a while so it basically

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:20,759
means if they screw up you get to pick

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:25,530
up the slack and share the plane so

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:28,560
little pro life time it sees a slow

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,449
process of labor's nice lot of labor

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,979
means that people tend to stick around

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:35,669
to finish it they actually have

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:37,589
motivation to contribute and as the time

00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:40,680
goes by because old people don't retire

00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:44,850
as fast as new people coming in for

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,520
example the Java project average how

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,560
long an average developer has been part

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,360
of the team gets hired by the time of

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,890
course in the beginning there's when you

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,180
have only one or two people when they

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,149
leave

00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:05,610
because it's quite a bit drops or

00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:09,570
increases okay conclusions from my first

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:12,089
part about recruiting when it's a lot of

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:16,860
work involved and when you have an itch

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:19,260
to scratch you don't want to you ideally

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,170
you would just be given that access and

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,529
you could be able to commit but you need

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:28,680
to strike a balance somewhere and for

00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,690
the future we are looking to make the

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,790
process easier by my creating from CVS

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:40,110
to cheat well I hope it makes the

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:42,270
process easier at least okay and anyone

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,550
have any questions about recruiting

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,910
people at this point if you have any

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:55,399
questions any other point feel free to

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:55,399
interrupt me yeah yeah look

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:30,040
there's a point there this distinction

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:32,170
which I didn't make here put up the aim

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,930
of this recruitment process is for

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,480
people who actually write code and have

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,310
actual developer studies so they need

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,620
some kind of CVS access or things like

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,860
that so you need to be able to

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,779
communicate with others in the team's so

00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,220
you need English skills but if you for a

00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,860
local community like marketing and

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,220
things like that you don't need to be a

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:57,040
developer in that sense I in an open

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,410
source community of users are encouraged

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,519
and hopefully participate as well as

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,839
much as possible so lesson we need

00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,560
official developer studies and things

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:10,300
like that the better so basically if

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,380
they don't know English they're probably

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,600
not be able to be to em they're not able

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,880
to read the technical documentation and

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,209
actually write the technical stuff our

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,350
to two translations if the source

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:40,829
language is English yeah I did that

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:40,829
answer your question okay yeah yeah

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,560
well that was one of goal to see if

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,020
someone would show up here and maybe

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,300
they were having some ideas but yeah it

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,350
makes sense but the problem is that the

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:25,990
in this sense distributions are probably

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,930
much more different in how they organize

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,490
themselves then in terms of packaging if

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,410
you have an auto tools based build

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:42,070
system there's not that many ways to

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:45,790
build it in the end but it makes sense

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:49,209
but as you start contributing Debbie I

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:52,529
know gentoo and other distributions you

00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:57,360
tend to forget the others exist at all

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:57,360
that's um if you just involved in one

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:27,400
yeah to a certain extent there's not

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,200
much big majority of the collaborating

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,550
recruitment if anything it's a place

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,080
where we're going to be competing you

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,180
know all we're going to start off the

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,680
users who want to learn more or to do

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:43,240
more specifically by the time you've got

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,070
a developer is going to be working water

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,070
projects they've already made a monitor

00:13:50,560 --> 00:14:02,380
and certain fanboyism of is always

00:13:53,950 --> 00:14:05,040
involved so many other questions are

00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:18,370
recovering there do you need that

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:21,430
there's Mike coming your way I was

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:25,420
wondering if you do you try to recruit

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:28,930
some people on some certain expertise

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:33,040
areas I mean maybe gentleness is an

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,070
expert on a particular error or you just

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,290
recruit people that are interested in

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:43,260
contributing code we we try to recruit

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,260
everyone who's contributing all right

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,790
there's some of their

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:06,920
so how did you come up with the process

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,980
well I inherited from the people wearing

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,680
approaches with project before me so I

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:17,360
don't know who how it was initially

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:20,570
conceived as any one of the chain to

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,510
developers year no no no one's been

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,670
around enough I know the process has

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:31,100
been pretty much the same since like 05

00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:32,810
and Chandu we had 10 year birthday so it

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,570
was conceived somewhere in the beginning

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:40,880
of last decade but that's all I know

00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:43,340
probably at the point when that you you

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,140
achieve the critical mass of developers

00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,830
you need to start enforcing some kind of

00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,510
quality assurance and then use such

00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,490
thing about the process the process

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,190
involves filling a couple of quizzes

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,930
technical quizzes so it's a wrapped

00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:07,400
around those checking them and having

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:08,810
people submit them okay there's any

00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,560
other questions before we move to the

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:14,480
actual more interesting part fer sher

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:24,770
which can be shared between distribution

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:26,810
which is getting rid of people yeah we

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:30,380
try if they're at see if they are

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:32,390
willing to stick around and a good

00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,430
enough technical level but if you

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,110
contribute to documentation usually it's

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,260
quite easy to kick doesn't mean that

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,360
sometimes you have to make up jobs

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:44,180
because I work on the canoe sense

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,850
distribution sometimes we get people

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:50,780
saying yes I'm see developer I want to

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:54,350
contribute yes well we don't have any

00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,850
work for you well yeah we do get a lot

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,800
of males from people like I've written

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,200
Java in the University I want to

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,920
contribute and we just reply back and

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:06,010
never hear from them but my point was we

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,960
try to recoup everyone who's contributed

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,250
those people who say they don't see your

00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,630
Java and whatever they haven't

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:16,610
contributed yet

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:18,560
probably won't there's a quite high bars

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:27,430
from actually mailing once and then

00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:27,430
actually writing a patch anything else

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:34,640
for example with a tool team or the

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,250
documentation team or something I mean

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,910
do you haven't needs from other teams in

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,650
gentle well the other teams are the guys

00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,260
who actually start the mentoring process

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:49,040
so the mentors come from the team's

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:53,630
themselves and I'm just no fish I'm just

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:55,880
a bureaucrat looking over the process so

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,790
they haven't that they have someone to

00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,920
actually talk with than that who will

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:06,670
teach them stuff who comes from like KDE

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,670
or no more toolchain on things like that

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:18,320
okay so why people stop contributing um

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,970
well each has been scratched so they

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,490
don't have any anything to contribute

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:27,110
anymore it's not fun anymore there's too

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:34,750
many trolls around and under engagements

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:39,500
in life for example getting a child so

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:41,090
how do people stop contributing well the

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:46,610
most popular thing I've seen is just

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:48,230
disappearing and some people are good

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,480
enough to announce that they're leaving

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:54,650
and take care of their packages are

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,530
moved to someone else and of course with

00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:59,960
a couple hundred people you have people

00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,670
who need to be removed them from the

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:07,300
community because they're just not able

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:07,300
to get along yeah

00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:16,009
maybe a little bit under 10 but that's

00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:18,950
an estimate I don't know about the

00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:24,460
earlier days but it's been a while since

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:28,429
last epic happening of things like this

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:37,460
mm-hmm a little bit under 10 that's my

00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:43,249
guess I don't live it under 10 active

00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:46,039
people is currently 265 but seeing in

00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:48,019
the indicated to be the protein running

00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,820
is probably being like thousand people

00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:53,899
involved in Seoul that's just a guess

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:57,350
but like 30 people came out last year

00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:59,960
and so it didn't grow that much from the

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,639
year before so about the same number

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,980
went out during the same time enough

00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:07,419
from that George can you say but what

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,419
hundred people are inactive

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,720
but those are not the people yeah a

00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,600
little bit like the core people who the

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:35,380
bulk of the world like 100 is my

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:39,130
estimate but bad apples like maybe 10

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:42,370
but there's this one familiar well one

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:46,270
well-known case not going to sell names

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:48,100
now but if you follow to any mailing

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:52,900
lists or things like that you probably

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:55,120
know what I'm talking about so what do

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,230
you some we have this developer away

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:04,330
system where you can say that you're not

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:05,710
around and can sell that where are you

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,460
and when you're coming back there's some

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:13,000
some of my pickups from the list so

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:15,250
someone from 2007 I said taking a break

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,460
for a while no other idea when I'll be

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:21,460
back probably not coming back this is so

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,500
does our retirement team needs more

00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:29,100
people and if you find someone

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:33,160
interested feel free to contact me but

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:35,710
some quite common to see messages like

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,559
this they're going somewhere and doing

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,360
things and then when it's done they

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,300
realize that they have better things to

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:48,070
do and then it just stays there for a

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,570
while so we do have a process SPD our

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,140
process coming in we have a process

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:57,280
going out we require a couple comments

00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,170
in last two months to stay active this

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,520
Debbie I'm chair have a policy these

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,330
days I think you used to have that

00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,330
everyone stayed in

00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,800
have a couple systems of slicing check

00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:18,240
but Bailey West posts or see if people

00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:21,120
are committing wedding packages if we

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,650
don't see any activity we don't yeah

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,080
there's some out Mike coming your way

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:28,400
yeah they get reminder emails that kind

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,679
of thing it's a fairly obvious process

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,390
yeah basically in for Debian you also

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,190
have a similar policy that you need to

00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:38,880
contribute to stay active yeah

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:41,490
absolutely and how we do it we send them

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,340
emails to which they reply yes I'm

00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,559
planning to get active again then they

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,970
may commit something and after a couple

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,510
of months the same thing happens again

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:54,720
then you might be we don't activate if

00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,730
you someone is interested in that it's

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:03,210
not a goal by itself to get rid of

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:05,850
people but why we do it if there's a

00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:08,580
package or bugzilla bug miss bugzilla

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:11,010
assigned to people it's better to say

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,470
that straight say upon that it's not

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,730
maintained so the user knows there it's

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,250
not maintained instead of there

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,679
someone's name from and the Box stays

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,470
open for a couple of years and for

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,870
security reasons you having everyone who

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:35,640
has access it's a possible security

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:39,600
issue so getting rid of bad apples bad

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,720
apples Sam can ruin your day and ruin

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,050
the atmosphere because as I started it's

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,330
supposed to be fun and if it's not fun

00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:50,910
and you get you don't get anything done

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:53,309
you just get sucked into endless

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:56,190
smelling these discussions and don't

00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:58,710
write code people are really likely to

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,270
just leave the project instead of I'd

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,570
find a place somewhere else where then

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:06,600
again do the work in a more constructive

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:10,020
environment so we have a team dedicated

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,420
to handle these issues and you can open

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:16,140
a bugzilla bug I complained about

00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:18,179
someone and our goal is of course that

00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,680
people are able to resolve the issues

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:25,000
between themselves but do all people get

00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:27,650
no so in the end you need some

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,510
intervention so how'd you find the

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:34,640
people to work on what to there's um how

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,590
do you find it well I didn't we don't

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,920
actively a final amount they have joined

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:52,460
the team at some point George do you

00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:54,590
remember how many there are so there's

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:58,120
three to five people on the team so it

00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,120
gets on the recording there

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:23,230
but the lead is a woman so maybe that

00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:26,870
helps no you dropped something so how

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:30,980
it's hard and you don't want to make

00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:33,770
mistakes you can ruin someone's mood and

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,510
life for a while because it's kind of a

00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,240
hard head when you get kicked out for

00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,560
bad behavior and usually those people

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,890
who get kicked out don't acknowledge

00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,570
they have a problem and if they

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:48,560
acknowledge they had a problem they will

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:51,050
seek help and the problem is once you

00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,520
kick someone out but if you if you've

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,220
always is that you are having an open

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,380
community you can't really stop them

00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,440
from still being part of the community

00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:03,140
at large for example mailing lists we

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,830
have people who have been kicked out

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:09,650
some years ago still around and there's

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:12,170
always a regular regular discussion

00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:15,460
about if they should be allowed to leave

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:18,260
a post at all so mailing list or not

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,360
yeah I'm not from we have a few filters

00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,760
in place on the mailing list so people

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,680
who are known trolls and stuff and also

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,900
some of the people who've been dropped

00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,030
on a project can no longer post of

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,650
course it's trivial if they really want

00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,190
to for them to forge their email address

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:37,280
or something but thankfully most of them

00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:39,440
don't do that we had a discussion about

00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,350
exactly this from various projects

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,160
couple of years ago one thing was

00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:47,810
suggested at the meeting was if you have

00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,480
a problem with people spamming your

00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:52,580
mailing lists and trolling a way of

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,700
getting around that is to have a clever

00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,470
filter that will won't send the mail out

00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,840
to everybody else but we'll put it in

00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,430
the archives so if they go looking for

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,800
the road mail they believe it's gone to

00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:09,680
everybody it's in the discussion but it

00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:11,600
can't carry on a 12 flame war then then

00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,600
they ever wonder why they don't get any

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,920
replies and apparel works for the

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,070
projects involved i think it sounds like

00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,510
a cute idea to try

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,850
the problem that comes up with that a

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:25,730
lot of people don't like moderation at

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,140
all there's always a discussion about

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,980
people who want to have at least

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:32,240
moderated and people wants and to have

00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,190
open access and of course when you have

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,310
moderators there's a problem if they're

00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:40,700
biased or not yeah absolutely so you

00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:43,040
were able to still get the in that the

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,870
some things are moderated or was it done

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:50,030
a decision by a project leader or some

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,830
consensus around I'm all in for the

00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:55,430
project in question I can't remember who

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,870
it was that suggested it it was agreed

00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:59,210
by consensus there was a reasonable

00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:01,130
thing to do and they had a committee or

00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,910
project lead or whatever would make the

00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:07,220
decision as to who would be involved

00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:11,330
it's not something we've tried boy it

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:14,240
might be useful so you and do you have a

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:19,280
process for kicking the a misbehaving

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,290
people out yes we do we have well we

00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,230
have a set of guidelines for people for

00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:28,160
example they can have their access

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:31,880
revoked if they abuse usage of various

00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,770
project machines say if we found and I'm

00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,530
not saying we have if we found someone

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:38,210
who was doing where's trading from in it

00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,100
from their account on the Debian much

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,550
server then obviously we want to take a

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,690
dim view of that and we kick them out

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:47,750
otherwise people have to go through

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:50,150
there is a defined procedure where if

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:53,600
enough developers enough other

00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:55,550
developers complain officially to the

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,150
people who are in charge of account

00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:00,980
management then a vote is started you

00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:04,970
know that that's kicks off a discussion

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,230
there is scope for vote and depending on

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,180
the results of that the person will have

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,130
their account removed it's only ever

00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,140
been invoked a very small number of

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,700
times it's biased earlier how many

00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:17,180
people you'd kicked out i think we've

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,040
how does it 45 maybe in the history of

00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:22,720
the project is places where we've

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:26,320
actually had to remove somebody it's

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,320
obviously it's a major step

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:37,130
let's see if I have a yep of course

00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:40,460
before actually kicking someone out we

00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:43,820
do try to use lesser means giving people

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:47,030
notices and suspensions and we have an

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:50,630
appeal process so the council which is

00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:52,520
the overall the highest ruling body of

00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,280
the community is you're able to appeal

00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,550
there and of course those are technical

00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:01,300
people well Alexis for technical skills

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:03,800
so it's not like you would be getting a

00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:09,080
similar treatment like a court but you

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:11,000
get judgment I peers mainland I assume

00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,150
assume it works pretty much the same

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,310
yeah absolutely um also that we go

00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,480
through whatever with seems reasonable

00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,030
to the people who are in charge of

00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,190
accounts there is always the possibility

00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,900
of going to a general resolution to

00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,760
overrule a decision like that and that's

00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:29,750
where we take a vote out to that to all

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,480
of the developers we obviously we try

00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,010
and resolve disputes first in any way we

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,410
can that's where the project Leda

00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,730
normally comes in if to developers

00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,230
really can't get on or if it's a

00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,410
technical disagreement we've got the

00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:45,200
tech committee if it goes any further

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:48,170
than that yeah we get we go this very

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,260
similar process to you one thing the

00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:53,510
discusses Sam infrastructure people can

00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:57,860
revoke access of course if they want to

00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:59,630
but the unit know if do you have like

00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,780
infrastructure structural people in

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:04,190
charge or adjust its separate like you

00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,460
said the people in charge of machines

00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:09,140
can revoke taxes or well we got the

00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,120
Debian sysadmin team who actually

00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,540
responsible for creating and removing

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,460
accounts they do have the power to

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,080
disable an account immediately without

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,510
warning if they think there's a security

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,720
risk for anything else they just get

00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:27,410
told what to do in terms of adding new

00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,970
logins or removing old ones of course

00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,800
actually is there anybody from any of

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,000
the other projects or distributions in

00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,290
the room here oh we're just having a

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,780
discussion

00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:37,130
you know I'm case if I have anybody else

00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:40,430
does that does anybody have any

00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:47,030
important all the federal guys went for

00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:50,420
lunch or what look well at least there's

00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:52,340
discussion between two projects but of

00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:56,030
course I'm guessing that like kubuntu

00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:58,430
and fedora where you have a corporate

00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:02,570
entity and they have job contracts for

00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:05,900
the core people sir there's legal issues

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,190
involved too for getting them out so

00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,760
it's a bit different from a purely

00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:19,420
volunteer the driven project like debian

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:22,520
or jen to see if i have it anyway

00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,590
there's seven minutes left I was

00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,450
reserving for discussion about course

00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:28,460
leads to stuff more if there was people

00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,350
here but there's not I guess we can if

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:33,440
we have more ideas we can just keep

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:37,400
discussing how do you do bad apples

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:41,110
anyone here have ideas about what do you

00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:46,580
think is the best idea to get people

00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:48,620
behaving better or out any opinions yeah

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,310
there's whim public should move the mic

00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,310
you want the record

00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,910
no no a few others have is I have some

00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:03,640
very small packages which I've written

00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:08,260
for my own use and happy to share up on

00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:11,080
sourceforge and I'm really not too sure

00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:14,260
how to the process of getting it into

00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,300
any package any distribution if I like

00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,070
now I've got this wonderful package

00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,050
called sushi how I get an integer too

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,380
well how do I get paper gentle to look

00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:25,290
at it see if it's worth anything or not

00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:30,940
I have a talk about it in like two hours

00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:37,150
so come by then any other questions or

00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:39,940
suggestions if I keep not we can have a

00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:43,860
break off like well that's seven minutes

00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,860
so oh there's one

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:07,670
so I like the idea of voting as in the

00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,470
entire community voting for a certain

00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:12,470
decision to be made because if the

00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:14,690
community is made or centered around

00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:18,230
those people who contribute their time

00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:20,659
then maybe it's the best thing to also

00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:25,040
let that community decide what they want

00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:28,130
by means of a majority fault somehow so

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,130
instead of having like a little if you

00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,899
people that actually are around the

00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:35,570
table and decide whether or not this is

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:49,880
okay maybe it should escalate in the end

00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:52,280
to the entire community to decide so i

00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,110
might not been quite unlikely i mean the

00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,300
lowly do is we have the trusted people

00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:58,970
who are delegated to be in charge of

00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,130
account maintenance and then if you

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,560
really need to go if there is a lot of

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:06,500
controversy about it then we can start a

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,950
vote to overall that decision we

00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,540
generally try to avoid voting on

00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:13,250
everything just be it slows us down

00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,520
obviously it's an important one of

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:18,680
people as if people have been kicked out

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,540
it's only ever if we ever get to the

00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,600
stage where an account manager will

00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,520
consider deleting an account and there's

00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,420
already clearly there's a lot of opinion

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,300
behind that and there's a lot of

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,390
evidence for it so we tend to assume

00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:35,330
that if they've made that decision it's

00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:38,090
correct and if they only then overruling

00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:41,030
is where the vote comes in and the

00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:44,330
problem with votes is that the opinions

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,340
of individuals can be based on wrong

00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,360
purely wrong information it's just a

00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,360
personal perception

00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:57,989
decide about right yeah

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,260
favor of them and off of the community

00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:17,750
against them and when you get to that

00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:20,450
stage if you go by a majority fold

00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:23,510
you're going in a very wrong way because

00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:26,120
it's going to be very odd in the end to

00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:27,920
get the community working again and it's

00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,380
going to create a rift and you know we

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,650
had it in the past I'll greeted that

00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:36,530
actually it also also that and yeah it's

00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,960
not like you are felt so if many people

00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,300
in your community actually dislike or

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,310
something else like that or just have

00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:47,540
the opinion even though it's not right

00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:49,430
then it won't work so that's actually

00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,350
why I think it's interesting too of

00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,990
course you shouldn't vote for everything

00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:58,400
that's that's obvious but for some cases

00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:00,410
and and we only had very few maybe it

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,760
would be interesting to at least consult

00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:07,250
developer base to at least get a heart

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,080
yes or no or something and then after

00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:12,560
that see if you maybe want to deviate

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,750
from that I can tell you that in in the

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,580
cases we had in the best most of the

00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,920
community had gone to the developer

00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:21,980
relations complaining about them so it

00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,290
it wasn't just the team deciding by

00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,960
itself the team got to decide because

00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:30,140
developers winter complaining about that

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,210
person and usually you get quite a few

00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,550
people and one of the issues as you know

00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:36,560
is that you know sometimes get to a

00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:39,770
point that most of the people that are

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,230
affected and that are upset by it simply

00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:44,390
stopped caring and so you can rely on

00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,740
them telling you we don't like this we

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:49,420
don't like this period this person we

00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:52,280
can work with them though the start

00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:56,900
they'll stop caring and in some cases

00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:58,310
they'll even go away yeah it's always a

00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,170
toss-up you don't want to lose your

00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,330
valuable contributes 10 valuable

00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:04,910
contributors because of one bad egg the

00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:07,190
matter how good they are um I mean for

00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:09,050
those again we don't we try to do we do

00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,960
a level best to him to take away just

00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:13,730
personal opinion like or dislike so when

00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,890
we come up with this procedure where I

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,520
think we need 15 Debian developers to

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,990
nominate and say this

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,540
it's disruptive and we better off

00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,950
without them the process then the next

00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,630
positive process this is all on the

00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:27,660
Debian website if you want to have a

00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:30,240
look the next part of the process is the

00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,980
person is notified the rest of the

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,350
project has notified that the process is

00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,900
in is going on we then ask for evidence

00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:39,360
from both sides before anyone makes a

00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,890
decision for against but specifically

00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,410
has got to be more evidence more than

00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:44,880
just oh my god this I hate this person I

00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:47,040
can't possibly work with them you've

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,080
actually got 2.2 chapter and verse biet

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,170
mailing list postings be evidence of

00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,670
just gent of bad behavior summer so we

00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:58,170
can actually try and make a reasonable

00:38:53,670 --> 00:39:00,690
rational decision just some question

00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,640
when you say you fold it's not a channel

00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:05,910
developer community right it's a council

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,160
that fall so um we don't I said we don't

00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,990
do a vote at this stage it's down to the

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,350
core down to the core account managers

00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:15,810
and the Debian account managers to make

00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:18,330
this decision if we go to a vote then it

00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:19,710
goes out due to gr which is general

00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,660
resolution for all the developers

00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,580
because at that point that overruling

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:29,370
the decision of a delegate and that's a

00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:33,830
defined process the app we're running

00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:33,830
out of time so thanks everyone thank you

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,460
