Title: The Ruby and .NET love child
Publication date: 2011-12-22
Playlist: FOSDEM 2010
Description: 
	By Ivan Porto Carrero

This talk will be about leveraging IronRuby from Mono and moonlight. Depending on the time I'd like to show how you can use IronRuby to easily extend your current GTK, WinForms,.. apps with scripting capabilities.

Perhaps how you can use IronRuby from Asp.NET MVC. If there is still time left I'd like to show you can script the browser and use Moonlight + IronRuby to use ruby as client scriping language instead or in cooperation with JavaScript.
