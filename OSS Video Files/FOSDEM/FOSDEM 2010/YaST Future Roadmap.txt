	00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,170
okay we're going to start our second

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,960
talk two distributions remissions for me

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,900
I cannot assume any more than all the

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,090
persons our business and users I will do

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,460
also a short project introduction so

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:20,490
people does not what we asked no it'll

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,289
bit what does it means so to start this

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,230
is our new logo this is how you will

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:31,769
find you asked in opensuse scintillator

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,750
in to release and some quick facts of he

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,610
asks right now the most complete

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,660
configuration tool available any

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:43,649
distribution is consistent it runs in 3d

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,600
friend a guy mode is also a development

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,670
environment you can write your own a

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,770
module sign planning spread that is a

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,020
very small core actually is less than 3

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,960
megabytes and with this you can write

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,710
modules that in basically any language

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:06,390
pearl group python and our language code

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,640
ycp so this is how just looks in the

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,700
tutee mode is the network settings of

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,420
open sullen with the same code you can

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,729
write under 80 DK you can unknown look

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,490
and with the same code you can go

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,020
together and curses you I which means

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,320
you can have many senior server of a

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,689
cessation for example I have even seen a

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:34,350
picture works in the cell phones using

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:39,509
this SH client the mollys we provide

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:41,579
videos are quite wrote in what they can

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,880
do you can't find Molly homes for

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:49,710
everything some modules are specific for

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,869
example tous les like is Cassie storage

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,189
battery tunnel but most of novices you

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,020
will find most of the others like you

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,140
should management you can configure

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,050
almost any kind

00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,510
server or client in key web servers and

00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,909
the value of obvious is not about

00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,950
touching the files or knowing the syntax

00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,840
of the configuration files but it's

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,270
actually integration like if you try to

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,100
configure an Apache web server and you

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,420
don't have these are no Tony to know

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,950
which packages you need to have

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,570
installed because yes we'll ask you to

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,120
install Apache if you don't have it in

00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,370
store and after you have it configured

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,250
it will actually open the 84th in

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,020
parallel so all the integration between

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:30,550
the modules is actually what we value

00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:33,820
with glasses in the last releases we

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:36,700
have invested a lot of making it nice

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:40,420
looking answer to a QTE features of

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,670
theming we also simplify a lot the

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,700
installation workflow to make the

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,870
installation simpler than us in so many

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,420
questions like before in some cases just

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:57,430
asking very very specialist in the same

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:59,950
screen we redid the UI of popular

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,440
modules like for example storage with

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,690
now this half looks much more

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,769
professional and supporting cryptography

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:11,200
near a vm it did also support them

00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:16,690
before but he was not the UI was not

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,790
thought for that we also have it's not

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,630
really part of the gas project but it

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:24,900
was born then the soup project which is

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:29,310
now that packet manager for a PM systems

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:32,860
it provides a really really fast soldier

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,680
compared to young on smart for example

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,490
we consume much less memory and supers

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,270
not really full feature

00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:43,400
come on line two so we bring the the up

00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:48,530
get experience of Vivian to our game

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,960
systems by the way this at solar project

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,940
is also independent of the sea project

00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,370
so it's a small library provides a

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,400
foolish solver and a half mechanism to

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,580
store really big amount of data coming

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,290
from packages if you ever want to do yet

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,960
another package manager you could build

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,000
it also on top of this Hut solar compete

00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:12,400
you are carrying the magnitude what is a

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,920
safety stand for sorry okay that's him

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:23,420
I'm trying to pronounce it in English

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:24,950
satisfiability i forgot the meaning by

00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,140
this bowling is brilliant equation so

00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,600
you have a you have an equation that has

00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,120
only boolean variables and you need to

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,170
find the solution actually sadly status

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,240
ability as far as I know okay honey so

00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:40,540
to quickly tell you what what does come

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,340
from what we do is we take the

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,430
dependencies of all the packages and we

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:49,820
turn that into a volume problem so a

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:53,210
requirement can be expressed as a

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,980
combination of logic arrivals and of

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,410
course nobody warranty seller is a

00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,480
solution but the problem of SAT is

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,840
really well known so there are a lot of

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,400
popular parcels and popular solvers also

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,340
varies based on mini south which is also

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,220
pretty popular and the nice thing is

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,830
that you can solve really complex

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,230
upgrades installations and you get

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,670
really nice results and the code of the

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,070
core of the solar is we simply because

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:21,980
it's just code to solve the equation is

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,140
not cold if the package fool around or

00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:29,060
also rumors like that and now we have

00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:30,950
ten times more and yes also provides a

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,690
complete moonshine inside a Suzy

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,980
environment I post a lot Susan vironment

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,650
Susi is a distribution that has more

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,420
value but a lot of the values to say is

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,850
also around cooling we have for

00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,780
distribution one example is the best

00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,200
service which

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,510
this vision has which is basically self

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,160
service package building we now have

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,710
sources to do which is self-serving

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,240
distribution building and there are a

00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,070
lot of other tools for example if you

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,680
want to build your own su set for your

00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,210
netbook and sell it and you have the gas

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,220
first boot which allows you to configure

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,310
the system on the first home if you want

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,720
to deploy souza your university in a

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,490
really dramatic way you have all the

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,540
outages framework where you can create

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,310
it as a CD or network booting and that

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:24,740
will automatically follow the extra

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:28,010
bution or asking minimal questions so

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:32,720
what did we offer them in the last year

00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:36,200
and what if we did actually in the 2009

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,580
challenge we wanted to leverage a base

00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,830
infrastructure because we introduced a

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,419
lot of features but from the moment you

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,820
add new code you'll have a new

00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,669
technology something innovative to the

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,919
point that actually the users can get

00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,200
this value you have to invest a lot in

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,000
usability and user experience that means

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,710
we have lot of features in the code on

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,300
there but we don't know exactly how to

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,300
bring them to the users are they are

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,410
easy and we want to improve also for

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,410
support for community and distribution

00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:10,289
one area where we did a lot of

00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:12,180
investment last year was in storage we

00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:15,749
just came from redesigning the complete

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,889
you I from this boat just partition your

00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:23,449
hardest model to now having raped nvm

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:28,919
support cryptography and we wanted to

00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:31,830
feel on top this new you are so this is

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,349
how the UI looks know you can see you

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,719
have a like a three kind of view where

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,490
you are you see the hard disk you can

00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:41,539
configure right right on top of this

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:44,460
artist you can also see the ldm volumes

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:47,300
which files encrypted we have also NFS

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,939
because you can't install also or to NFS

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:55,039
exports and what kind of features we

00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:56,969
added since 11 2 we have support

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,039
experimental support because actually

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:01,020
the file system is not ready for battle

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,879
if this and this is a really good

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,740
technology we are that they support

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,699
utmost importance we can that means we

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,560
can create partitions on form a little

00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,990
butter business or will it start

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,419
improving these as butterface matures

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,219
and getting to the distributions you

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,459
don't know what other it is the name

00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:21,930
Parker comes actually from butter

00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:23,580
because it's a kind of kind of flexible

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,990
file system you might have heard about

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:31,259
set FS from salaries which allows you to

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,899
create volumes and glue copyright

00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,729
snapshots and so on so butter faces are

00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:39,209
the same for nukes it's a development in

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:41,370
vehicle despite cool I think they have

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:43,589
done lots and you know these things and

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:47,069
maybe a more caring limitation that this

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:50,940
large guy so this will be coming and

00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:52,769
would be ready for it also we mentioned

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,589
like why a battery fails may be

00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:58,880
interesting for us an end user but

00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,880
that's later in the challenge part

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,220
also in 11 dot to you have the option to

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,899
use x4 it's actually I've been in Port

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,550
and we will add we others already in

00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:16,520
factory supported use factor you ready

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,520
because this support the UI for nfsv4

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:24,899
then you have another two nice features

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,000
you use grade usually you create you

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,800
have a disk you partition this disk and

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,480
then you have to take another disk and

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,310
partition in exactly the same value as

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,959
the first one and if you have one of

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,480
these called competition complex

00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:38,790
partition schemes is becomes really

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,170
boring so now we support this story

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,430
which means you can decorate coptic

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,730
partitioning and have died to another

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,649
disk and if you don't like that we also

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,589
support then this new feature of linux

00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:51,959
kernel 2.6 which is called partition of

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:55,140
the raid arrays this means you can take

00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,060
a row disk make it a raid array first

00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,760
and then you can partition the red

00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,260
arranged as a wall so you don't need to

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,160
partition the disk before you create a

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:07,399
great erase the advantages are here as

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,399
much

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,900
and the next feature we I think we work

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,570
really hard for this one is a

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,570
contractually for just for laptop at

00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,430
cost or fifty thousand dollars you know

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:26,120
what she laughs to this happen it's not

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:32,270
macbook air I think that was a bit

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,950
cheaper no yes but actually the laptop

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,590
that cost is money according to Intel is

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,320
a laptop that is calling because in

00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:43,060
average companies if you use a laptop

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:48,080
the average of money news from this is

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:50,210
about 50k so the problem is today

00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,940
everyone has a laptop and i think one

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:55,430
every one every six person will get the

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,360
laptop stolen or lost and if you have

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,800
any data from much innocent it looks

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,230
it's really a problem if it's just in

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,540
the heart is lying around so there are a

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:11,660
lot of a lot of solutions to these

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,640
problems cryptography is one I think

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:18,860
these presumes a lot on how in

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:20,210
cryptography today very simple thats a

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,410
cryptography is the solution these

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:26,870
people the second Prince alias it's not

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:30,290
but if you are hiding data from the

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,000
government baby this comic is true but

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,710
if you are hiding your accounts or

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,930
concrete information cryptography is

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,660
actually a pretty nice solution if it

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:41,660
works out of the box and with working

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,740
out of the box if you see the solutions

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,020
you have right now you look like

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,850
encrypting your home directory it

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,490
doesn't really work because the system

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,320
leave traces of your data in other

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,800
places like in the swap in the memory

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,260
temp files so if you have just a part

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,670
encrypted in your system you are not

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,560
wearing t that you will leave traces

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,420
other way you know in other places of

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,070
the system so the only solution is not

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,950
going to encrypt the complete system as

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:12,230
a world but the encrypted system as a

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:13,850
wall it means what how do I have a lot

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,850
of conditions but I need to enter my

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,910
password for every party

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,410
and so on so we have enough support for

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,220
full disk encryption with a really nice

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,050
team and the best of this is that is

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,420
supported out of the box you just click

00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,019
in the UI I want this kind of setup I

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:36,230
want to grip you enter your password and

00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:38,790
yes we'll build the boot partition and I

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,670
encrypted partition using the this

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,230
matter on top of your hard disk and top

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,750
of this encrypted partition will be that

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,310
will and lvm system so they start the

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,360
root and any partition you want is an

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:55,319
lvm that means you just encrypt your

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,540
loved ones and assume a suspend or our

00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:02,639
boss so if you resume for the hard disk

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,019
it will ask your passport and if not you

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,130
can just not see the computer power

00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:11,720
system it works very nice I am running

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:15,540
here in this laptop and I can tell that

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:18,300
my encrypted system using export as a PI

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,889
system works much faster than my old

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,540
file system my old 11-1 open source with

00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:30,389
using x3 without an encryption and

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:36,660
that's peanuts and another hardware we

00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:38,850
invested correlated to was upgrade there

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,009
is a mean that didn't want the only

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:44,370
distribution of to do a drop rate of the

00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:48,329
complete edition and so on and say this

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:51,240
is 11-1 we support also this method do

00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:55,319
you know why your encrypted x-force

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:58,649
Boston direction I have no idea I

00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:00,269
suppose because x 4 is faster because I

00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:03,149
was suspecting I mean when I decided to

00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:06,060
get my whole heart is i thought okay i

00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:08,100
mean i'm willing to lose on performance

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,899
because the encryption but at the end

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,180
the food i'm talking about the complete

00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,009
system i haven't done any measure onion

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,750
the file system part it may be also that

00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:18,569
the insufficient as a world is getting

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,750
faster basically i'm telling is that the

00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:24,120
use of andalusia 11-2 with a previous

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:31,290
setup you won't fail you won't lose any

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:34,140
performance compared to 11-1 thanks on

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:37,620
the upgrade and what we wanted to

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,680
support here was going from one

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,360
distribution released to the next one as

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,040
a supported way that mean having a wiki

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,990
page thats place the most typical

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,339
promise you can encounter but it should

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:53,430
just work out of box here you can see

00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:55,500
the most common use case we run into the

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,110
boxes size are actually real life

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,730
propulsion proportions have you seen

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:05,370
either the two boxes looks like a book

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:09,140
of matches you can find this wiki page

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:12,089
all the instructions to do this upgrade

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,640
if you use factory we don't support it

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:16,410
officially but you can I mean we don't

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,720
have an instruction page with how to do

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,430
it but you can run just zip it up with

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,140
factory and keep your system up to date

00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,540
in the same way you will do with other

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,640
distributions like came to or daily

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:31,650
unstable and so on just keep the latest

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:34,320
all the time the algorithm we use for

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,720
the for the system upgrade is also

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,490
internal to the SAT solver so more

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,010
aggressive upgrade it will install

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,320
packages competed and so on the nice

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,020
things about having a leading edge

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,209
distribution in our p.m. is that Mar

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,770
p.m. when will the packages miss

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:52,800
tracking dependencies of the libraries

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:55,050
directly from the binaries so it's not

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,630
like a video where they the package has

00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:00,240
said I depend on the x11 I depends

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,890
library and then if the library changes

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,810
the subversion or something or the

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,730
packages class of estate you can have

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,310
actually broken dependencies buddy in

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,900
your field service we struck a lot of

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,850
dependency automatically and insert them

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,209
into the air p.m. and that makes that

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,459
the dependence is much stronger so it's

00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:19,830
really hard to get broken system you can

00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:21,990
get a lot of dependency problems when

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:25,920
trying to do the upgrade if you don't

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:28,380
have a little packages to come again to

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,480
a consequence take the subway will tell

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,320
you you can or you need to install this

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,290
or you need to

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,150
choose something but it's not easy to

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,460
get a broken system then how do you

00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,650
distinguish between build time

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,860
dependencies and runtime dependencies if

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,660
you're doing it automatically what do

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,110
you mean with runtime dependencies well

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,180
say you need a library to run your

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,060
software but you need something

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,860
different to build it if you're doing

00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,740
all that stuff in the background how do

00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,560
you know where I mean when you build a

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,240
spec five provinces it right you don't

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,740
expect and you need to build against the

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:11,100
lip curl you the packager will specify

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,980
the curl in the current level in the bin

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,199
requires but he will not specify lip

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,870
curled in the required he doesn't need

00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,400
to because if he doesn't do anything

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,230
requires you will have ever get the

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,240
package to build because we building a

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,030
seat food environment so only what's

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,800
specified the bill requires gets there

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,810
but once it gets built when it's

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,180
finished building there is some scripts

00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,800
from the game build process that scan

00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,460
all the binaries and libraries we have

00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:41,790
and get all the symbols and the symbols

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:45,720
are inserted as a as a required and the

00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:47,430
library so we don't require the name of

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,200
the package of the library you better

00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,020
that's cool new symbols and then the

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:58,950
library provides the symbols and that

00:17:52,020 --> 00:18:01,050
makes really strong dependencies so we

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,090
also wanted to this is something is

00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,650
reading progress but not in factory an

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,620
11-2 you really have this tool called

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,630
bagman battering the sense of moving you

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,750
from one institution to another one bomb

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,630
is just a last front and to the lipstick

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,250
distribution operation algorithm it

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,940
allows you to do the upgrade in a

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,980
graphical way and it offers you the

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:27,090
possible paths you have to have patience

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,010
tribution and do do lot of stuff like

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:34,260
updating itself first to see the fit

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:36,510
slightest running code and we want to

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,130
bring this tool to make the complete

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,320
work for the desktop so that you cannot

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,520
file this a new opensuse release you

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,160
click yes I want to

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:49,290
then you can just click next next until

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:57,330
you are running the system so this is

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:59,340
our desktop upgrade plan we have all the

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,680
product information in rpm called who

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,350
needs which is in this case opensuse

00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,850
released okay they pollute information

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:10,110
contains all the upgrade path and so one

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,300
of the zoo sea level one is released

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:16,080
there is no upgrade path I'm release 11

00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:18,000
2 which is updated release package we

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,640
release an update for the wrist package

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,490
of 11 one that says that you can jump to

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:28,410
level 2 package kid has a signal

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,670
standard ever seen i'll call this please

00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,920
drink this visual upgrades available

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:36,990
it's not a single actually said query

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:40,920
story package P is integrated to leave

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:42,750
saved using a special time so we find

00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,340
this new upgrade path and we can notify

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,470
to the desktop in a real standard way

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,470
that means that every package key tool

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,090
will get this signal and react and when

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:54,440
the user says yes i do want to upgrade

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:57,300
and click yes we run a distribution

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,820
specific tool because package delegate

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,680
is tasked to some script and in your

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,170
case we launched by man i think that

00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,550
other guys are doing it differently i

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,110
mean they get information about the

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:10,680
possible distributions from other place

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,570
and then they started tool called free

00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,950
update free upgrade or something they

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,630
have another tool the nice thing is that

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,790
for the end user they only see in

00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,790
package kids applications about nice

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:26,490
when we started to support distribution

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:29,010
upgrade we come of course people started

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,620
to use factory and they wanted to update

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,570
every day and they was 12 swamp package

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,040
knew they wanted to get it and then we

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:40,410
started to find out all the problems

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:42,360
like it takes ages to update 1 packet

00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,820
change and then everything was revealed

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:49,320
because our game stores the time stamp

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:51,210
in their pions you basically got two

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,860
gigabytes of new packages they were just

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,750
exactly as

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,760
parents as before but because they were

00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,440
rebuilt by tendencies they got a

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,000
different time stamp so they have even

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:07,220
checksum and therefore they need

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:09,130
packages I think this problem that was

00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:14,240
one problem another one was of course

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:16,910
download and wife I think one assumes

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,740
that everyone is running as fast psl

00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,510
everywhere but then you have those

00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,850
people that likes to upgrade the stop

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,679
what they are in the bus I don't know

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,179
what people do that that they do and

00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,580
there's people who are still using it

00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:30,230
slow lines everywhere they complain that

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,940
they don't get the best viewers and so

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:38,390
on so for this we also tackle this

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,160
problem last year this one we tackle in

00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,280
using area as the download backings the

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,919
curl year and two is updated by default

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,990
Rea the download manager that has a

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,700
really nice metal in support so it finds

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,429
the best in verse and the nice thing is

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,640
that it provides the FTC's and then it

00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:57,830
saves the result of its course so next

00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,210
time you will always choose the mirrors

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:04,130
at work best for you and also we're

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,780
using your mirror brain infrastructure

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,100
that we have three nicely directors I

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:13,030
think there was a talk about little

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:15,830
brain was weak its Nexus yeah okay sorry

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,830
area two are you able to use that as a

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:21,530
library or do you work your special we

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:25,640
 okay we work it and everyone

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:28,880
does yeah yeah we are communicating all

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,940
the time with with the jacks with here

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,059
with the outer and especially to add

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,280
features but number other than to them

00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:38,660
no actually we have today when we have

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,429
to talk with him to agree on the

00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,340
protocol and they have a common line

00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:45,530
options it's tricky but to be honest i

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,480
mean i have x base experience with all

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,240
the tools we call from lake city library

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,520
and we form processes i have better

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,919
results for Kim processes usually they

00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,620
guys much more stable and trying to

00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,200
follow libraries will curve or something

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,450
we have

00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,150
locking issues threading and so on we

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,210
don't have to worry about monthly so we

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:08,280
also introduced his last year a lot of

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:11,550
features that were requested in our cake

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,890
features of the Susa or the most

00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:17,880
interesting one is a download control

00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:20,600
before Susan used to turn one package in

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,400
storage dangan package install it

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,380
because we trust all the mix it

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,230
dependencies holder so we stole other

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,910
games between videos force because then

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,990
we already know exactly in France

00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,040
actually want to do the discipline

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:38,520
system the problem is that if you lost

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,500
the network and you are in the middle of

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,950
one transaction you basically have our

00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,720
non-persistent system so by the

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,720
installation you actually do want to do

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,190
that because you don't want to use this

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,180
space because you are running on one for

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:58,410
example so we introduce these four

00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:00,450
options to live sitcom Donald only means

00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:03,330
now you can now say packages this

00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:05,670
featuring was surprisingly because lot

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,260
of people use actually let's see to

00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,330
download the packages to the transaction

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,780
then hoping these packages to use be

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:15,390
Stig and deploy them somewhere else like

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,190
in two other servers something ever i

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,760
thought it was used on it was really

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:23,730
popular then we have not only in advance

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,410
which is the classical isn't basically

00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,210
downloading the all the packages and

00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,610
then starting the construction for that

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,280
we first artist but is the most safe

00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:34,590
case and in your package keep back in

00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,810
the way we do the updating we now use

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,870
these option as a default because we

00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:41,280
don't want people to get transactions

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,750
interact in the middle in the air they

00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,910
are out of battery order they are

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,580
suspending the zone then we have

00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,840
tunneling hips which means we this is

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,450
not internet again that we have the

00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,930
option there because this option is

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:57,780
basically a subset is a more particular

00:24:54,930 --> 00:25:01,080
case of this one internally hips to

00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:03,930
download a bunch of rpms that a lawman

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,150
represent are consistent transaction and

00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,920
then you continue with the next ones but

00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,530
we don't have it implemented so you will

00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,730
just

00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:15,580
as everyone but this is still valid we

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,230
will implemented in Poland equities and

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,270
none of us needed is the classical

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:23,230
behavior where we just need a package

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:25,930
and we install it and there we the only

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,790
thing down on us needed do is that it

00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,940
tries to avoid TV hoping so you have two

00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:33,070
CDs and there are packages from one CD

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,190
we try to grab as many packages from one

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,950
CD before jumping to the other one to

00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:42,670
avoid people hire you to switch these

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:46,690
and of course we implemented this elixir

00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:49,630
and super awesome so you can alter the

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,490
behavior is making the common line

00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,520
overriding while you see the sitcom fun

00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,110
you can use any of those four options or

00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:01,420
you can use download and pass the name

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:09,550
of the mode you want to use also there

00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:10,630
is some download control built in you

00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,450
cannot tell for example how many

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:16,540
connections you not to avoid floating

00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:18,400
servers there is option to set the mini

00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,900
meltdown speed this is for security

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,360
reason I was also impressed about this

00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:26,470
report there is a theoretical attack

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,750
where tacker can give you an update a so

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,660
slow speed that they will take forever

00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,330
to cut this update and therefore will

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,540
leave your system bootable for a long

00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:40,510
time okay it certainly got that is you

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:43,630
can all set mini allows be before lips

00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:46,150
it actually drops the connection and of

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,740
course you have the area's pants in the

00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:50,560
culture flips if so if you want to enter

00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:54,820
the ranking yourself to strictly verse

00:26:50,560 --> 00:27:00,190
in a different way you can also do it so

00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:01,660
we we have two topics resolve and I

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,390
think the only one that is left is

00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:07,180
trying to use the subjects for factory

00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:09,190
update but we are not yet we have done

00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:13,000
research exactly how much that we have I

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:15,990
think this experience now after a culo

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,809
in factory implemented all these

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:20,429
compares that package is not pushed to

00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,980
the factory viewers it is exactly the

00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:25,710
same build as before only the timestamp

00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,400
change we compared the binaries with

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:33,240
relieve complex algorithm and if they

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,740
are the same binary or equivalent then

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,510
we don't push it is not a new pocket

00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,809
that made an artisan factory much

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:41,400
smaller so this is something is anything

00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:46,980
but we are not sure if would actually

00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:49,429
pull it as a priority and this might be

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,540
interesting for a lot of people there

00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:53,130
was a lot of people complain that we

00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,410
didn't have support installing multi

00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,420
version kernels that means having

00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:00,210
multiple version of kernels into at the

00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,910
same time being added to update them now

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:06,809
we have a switch sitcom that allows you

00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:09,330
to specify any kind of package you want

00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:10,770
to keep him move diversions for the

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:14,100
canon decidedly more complicated you

00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:16,050
have to put it as I provide I don't want

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,760
to go deep here in this talk about that

00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:21,150
but the smooth mostly because dependency

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,860
with chemicals with drivers but you can

00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,290
specify any package that I'm installing

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:30,360
parallel in this line and then you will

00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:33,900
get the UI to actually show instead of a

00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:37,230
rival bottom will show check boxes this

00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,179
was implemented for a slash funding she

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:44,130
get us an update for 11-2 because these

00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:46,679
are really popular request then we have

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,480
the package notifications now you if you

00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:51,510
do an RP and yourself you can drop

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,450
script message to expect to the user

00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,910
into these directory called message

00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:00,600
stairs there is a standard directory

00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:03,630
called bar ATM sip messages and you can

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,980
configure now which program will

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,490
actually display the message to the user

00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,770
by default we send emails to root on but

00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:17,080
you can you be kind of take it to do

00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:19,670
everyone with a messages so

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,730
what have you done to integrate us with

00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:25,280
the rest of the world this is our vision

00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:28,310
prime now we want to integrate the

00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,960
system instead using already stopped for

00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:32,570
that data center we are trying to follow

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,580
sin of the desktop we are going with

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,420
divas that means gasps this compd

00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,860
accessible now be a diverse political

00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:43,340
package kids for systemic for supper

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:47,180
management for the appliances on all the

00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:49,880
world that sushi spoon is bringing we

00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,970
want to use the web and why want to use

00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,400
the web basically because everyone

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,620
speaks the web I think everyone in this

00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:01,400
room knows HTTP button bro nobody knows

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:03,470
by CP so that's why in the web chaos we

00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,940
are doing for appliances we are

00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,740
inventing everything using a rest

00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,830
interface so you can configure your

00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,900
system just with XML HTTP in the last

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:17,840
force then I actually show a prototype

00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:19,040
of a podcast with this interface and by

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,500
now we are going to get a much better

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:25,280
shape this is how obvious to do right

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:27,920
now you have updates you can set things

00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,470
like time services that you can see the

00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:34,250
status of your clients using a codec d

00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:36,190
statistic T 1 you can see the health of

00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,900
your system you can convince their users

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,880
we haven't really focus what years in

00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:44,390
opensuse yet is available be available

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,820
in the repositories but we wanted to

00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,100
offer it something you can be used to

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,200
the studio to build your own appliance

00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,630
like a fire water Reuters on that you

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,180
can use web he asked us to integrate and

00:30:53,630 --> 00:31:00,310
to provide the minimal configuration of

00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:03,920
diamonds of course in work yes we are

00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:05,570
always requesting help is much easier to

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,750
contribute them in normally ask because

00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:11,300
is Ruby on Rails just some integration

00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:14,630
with the system so what designers

00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:18,290
JavaScript we served and so on are

00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:21,140
welcome in this project the source code

00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:23,520
I forgot to update these slides is now

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:29,820
in notorious or opensuse because we move

00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:31,350
the problem so i will now what's our the

00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,650
challenge and opportunities we have i

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:36,540
asked first we have to lower the barrier

00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,070
I mean we have a nice infrastructure we

00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,750
have the good service we have

00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,550
repositories people can build their own

00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,350
packages they can so they won't suffer

00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:46,560
with one click they can building on

00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:49,080
distributions but it's still complicated

00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:52,500
we don't we are not providing these

00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,840
experience yet everyone in tapping the

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,550
telephones in the mat in the other

00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,380
things they are used now to go to a

00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,180
portal having applications and just

00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,710
click and seeing what is the most

00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,780
popular stuff and we are not providing

00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:06,200
these experiences we are far away from

00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,790
that there is some hope in Susa project

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,820
some guys in the community doing a kind

00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:13,920
of software storm supper portal I think

00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,880
that's the first step of getting into

00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:21,470
experience where people can kind of add

00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,470
the social part to installing software

00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:28,920
right now the military's feel exposes a

00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:34,260
lot of complexity you try to understand

00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:35,910
how the KD or the Ruby repositories work

00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,100
together what you have to have to get up

00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:41,790
to make things work and so on it's still

00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:44,090
a long long way to go in 11-1 we

00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:47,370
introduced observances which is a way of

00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:50,280
making lot of repositories our Casa

00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:52,470
black box so that you can say subscribe

00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,510
Italy service and every day and this

00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:58,890
service has a list of repositories which

00:32:54,510 --> 00:33:01,710
can be dynamic these technologies the US

00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:04,230
is one distribution and we don't get

00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:07,500
exposure to the end user this can be

00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:11,610
used to solve lot of problems we could

00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:16,680
create bundles of repositories ly ke we

00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:19,470
could for example integrate maxilla so

00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,679
if a guy is testing a bug he just

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,360
refresh his services

00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:24,700
he gets a special request we're going to

00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,970
build circuit which has a update for the

00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:30,100
bag he is testing or you can just

00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,379
subscribe to the service of the most

00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,909
popular repositories you refresh this

00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:37,269
service and then you get a completely

00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:39,039
different list next all you could store

00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:40,840
your repository list your favorites in

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,840
the gun service and your subscribe to us

00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,669
your service in the desert there's a lot

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,129
of season when we come in here can be

00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:52,299
done here and I guess the community can

00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:53,619
be much more involved with respect in

00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:56,919
package of history we haven't done

00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:58,869
anything so this is something we wanted

00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:01,690
to invest all the last in the last

00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:06,549
possum and we haven't actually it's not

00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:08,980
even in very much priorities the most

00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:11,740
top bolt features are around download

00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:14,290
install in parallel which is in our plan

00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:17,020
the route body will try to do for level

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,940
3 and show any packages or a way to

00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,669
clean up your system of packages that

00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:25,809
are not needed is also in a rather

00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:27,760
something we are researching on this is

00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:30,069
the what we are also investing for this

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,909
for the next release rollbacks which

00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:36,040
means allowing people to go back to

00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:40,379
where they were before after you apply

00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:43,659
updates and so on these are topic every

00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:45,819
rpm hasta I think tried water in the

00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:47,799
past canary has rolled back everyone

00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:51,639
does it in a different way package ki

00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:53,319
AAP i also have robots but i think they

00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,929
remove it because they could not get it

00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:58,260
to work you know as people spective to

00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:01,359
work it's not a trivial problem anyway

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,160
so we are thinking about adding some

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,369
kind of interface will exceed exposing

00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,470
in last in c / but we are not married

00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:10,960
yet with any strategy about how to do

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,119
the wall box so we research doing them

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,280
just with a package history comparing

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,530
what change in the system for example if

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,960
a package was installed because other

00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:21,790
targets depend on it we know that these

00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,619
packets actually was not the user who

00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,930
actually wanted to solve this packet he

00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:27,760
was just needed so we could remove this

00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,890
package when a packet that was elected

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,750
directly by the user even if nobody

00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,360
depends on

00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:36,420
um you cannot assume that you can just

00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:38,010
wipe it maybe we can research about the

00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,990
assistant partitions like google chrome

00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,590
is to use using that means having to

00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:45,000
system partitions hard disk is cheap

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,580
every time you will fall packages to

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,320
just update the status of the second

00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,520
partition to the first one and it's

00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,650
something Faison you can it doesn't

00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:56,040
would just switch the petitions again

00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:58,200
you have again a working system and we

00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,400
also have but better has options that's

00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,470
why I mentioned the beginning of the

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,570
talk is interesting because it provides

00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,360
a really cheap way to do snapshot of the

00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:10,530
system and go back right all right thing

00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:12,650
yum is going with pattern FS I'm not

00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:15,390
sure yet what's the best way because

00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:17,220
having implementing the batter if s me

00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:20,280
means you need to have all their best

00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:23,670
viruses so we will see this is also in

00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:31,020
our top priorities and that is Bob's

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:37,650
thank you very much so anyone has

00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:39,690
questions or yes what I'd like to say

00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,730
well I found advertisement and my

00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,520
attitude to the advertisement concerns

00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:46,230
they are two talks tomorrow or Warbeck

00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,080
which are coming from our research

00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:52,680
project and will see different aspects

00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,180
of the office or a question to move the

00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,039
second team concerns my name your

00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,229
question that's I would like to know

00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:03,069
more about how you're using the SAT

00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:05,349
solver to use to resolve the problems

00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:08,380
between neca jizz that is also something

00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:11,199
we have been doing in research projects

00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:14,469
it's a long time and so to make a

00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,839
complete if you want to if you have no

00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:19,239
requests to install something there are

00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:23,289
a lot of different solutions that are

00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:26,699
positive and includes use different

00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:30,209
strategies to make a difference to work

00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:32,109
to find a solution that you could ask

00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:35,709
coordination of these terms of you

00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:39,279
packages are minimal insulation size or

00:37:35,709 --> 00:37:41,709
you could try to you prefer certain

00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:44,049
packages and to give this a bunch other

00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:46,779
packages or to be moved to this number

00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:49,630
of packages things of that nature do you

00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:51,160
have fixed strategy that you employ in

00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:55,749
order to find the best solution or do we

00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:59,259
have the notion huge yes and no a SAT

00:37:55,749 --> 00:38:03,159
solver API has hooks call policies where

00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:06,069
you can ask you can score the different

00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:07,869
solutions as you want 44 or package

00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:12,819
management system we do have six

00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:14,259
policies like architect Chinese

00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:16,329
architecture for example something we

00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:19,809
don't want to do taking that detector of

00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:22,569
the package if the resolution of means

00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:24,579
change the connector for package then we

00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:28,900
divide by 20 architecture like switching

00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:31,569
from 64 bit to 32 bits okay if you would

00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,729
do super upgrade not that this upgrade

00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:36,819
but upgrade we don't want solutions that

00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:39,130
applies and renewing packages so all

00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:40,869
these things are policies and they start

00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:43,150
solving fruits lot of policies you can

00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:46,390
use but if you use the sub genres and

00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:49,430
ivory you can always plug the code so

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:53,250
you can plug your own policies yeah and

00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:56,100
